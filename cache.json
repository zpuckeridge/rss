I had it set up locally initially, until I secured it a bit and then added a subdomain on the host and allowed external access. Everything still works using the external FQDN and I also changed the URL in the env variables in Portainer.\n Trying it from an Android mobile (on the same network) using Opera/Chrome/Kiwi and the frontend loads but says it cannot connect to the backend. By default I still had the local LAN IP configured in the env variables. Changed this to the docker network address and also the external FQDN (after forwarding ports) and they all worked on desktop still but none of them worked on mobile. Changed the address on the error page the frontend loaded and also changed the env options in Portainer.\n I'm not sure what to look at now.

One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.\n The new Appwrite Console in v1.1\n Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.\n To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.\n In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:\n 🖥️ Dashboard\n 🔐 Authentication\n 💽 Databases\n 🪣 Storage\n ⚡ Functions\n 🧙 New Wizards\n ... and more!\n Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.\n We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI.

Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.\n For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.\n 40k photos in one view\n Progress update as of 11/22/2022\n tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.\n Some of the major new features:\n Live Photo Support\n  \nThanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.\n HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.\n  \nVideo Transcoding\n  \nMemories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.\n Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1\n  \nMultiple Timeline Folders\n  \nFor maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.\n You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)\n  \nServer side encryption\n  \nIf you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore\n  \nNew metadata sidebar\n  \nYou can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar\n  \nNew photo viewer\n  \nWith some fancy UX. Try it out ;)\n  \nThe full changelog can be found here.\n If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊\n    submitted by    /u/radialapps  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the short time it was on the air, it received many upvotes, there were many sympathetic responses and it seems that the purpose for which I wrote the articles was achieved and helped many people. 😊\n I'm attaching the article once more in the hopes that more people will be able to read them and share their opinions, as it would be a shame for me if this opportunity were lost and those who didn't have time to read would miss it.\n And of course don't forget to star the repo! ⭐\n MonoBox's GitHub repo: MonoBox \n Introducing MonoBox: How & Why I Built My Very Own Music Player \n Another shorter piece that describes my process step-by-step and includes videos and coding milestones, which may provide additional or related ideas: \n Build Your Own Spotify: Killer Programming Project Idea in React Native and FastAPI\n    submitted by    /u/Ozzs55  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So just to start I do not need a launcher that is not the problem I'm trying to solve, I've seen other people ask about this sort of thing in the past and it seems people tend to misinterpret \"organizer\" as launcher. The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.\n I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.\n Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.\n At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?\n    submitted by    /u/Chaos_Therum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.\n Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.\n 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.\n  \nHuginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nautomatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted (for now).\n  \nn8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.\n  \nHosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.\n  \nBeehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nPower Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.\n  \nHosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).\n ---\n I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.\n 👇 Links to these tools in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/usamaejazch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.\n I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).\n I have the following setup:\n  \nCloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.\n \nNginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.\n \nOpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.\n \n I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.\n Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.\n    submitted by    /u/xViMeSx  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Github Community Plan.\n This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. \n Step 1: Create a github account\n Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)\n Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.\n Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with \"Select Network\" as it should be under the \"Multi-user tailnet\" banner.\n Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the \"Github Community Plan\".\n Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. \n Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.\n    submitted by    /u/Stetsed  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I am leaning to option one because it would be simpler and continues with my business plan to expand into my own software, create mirrored servers for redundancy etc...\n Edit: I am also worried about potential liability concerns regarding data loss.

I'd like to stay free but also serve media, without drastically reducing my security. You guys can tell me if this is unreasonable 😄\n What's the next logical step?\n All my services have their own username/password, some have 2FA, but I'm interested in OAuth. Does it make sense to use a cloudflare tunnel for the authentication of say, a Jellyfin server, but once logged in, just use a direct connection? How would one go about that? Looking into Caddy 2/Traefik but I'm not sure if I'm overlooking any big flaws.\n Or, if I want some services (say, Tandoor recipes) to be under Cloudflare's protection, but others (Jellyfin) using a 'direct' connection, is it possible to achieve both of those on the same domain name (under different subdomain)?\n    submitted by    /u/UrielCopy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have 3 VLANS setup:\n  \nManagement - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc\n Home - My personal devices\n Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services\n  \nMy firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).\n I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.\n This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.\n Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?\n ​\n Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN?

Like a giant cdn but provided my individuals who are willing to share their bandwidth (with limitations) or host FOSS software like searxng across all the nodes so it will never go down. It might be hard but can we do this? I can acquire a lot of IPv6 ips and we could try to boost IPv6 in a small way. We could use anycast as load balancing\n EDIT1: I get the legal implications with a cdn. So it is a hard choice. We could disable video or sharing or large files. But we can easily run Foss software for people who can't maintain that software to be up 24/7 or people who can't. It can be a centralized place for a decentralised network.

I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. \n First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as \"animal\" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. \n Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members \"user level\" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. \n I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.\n It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server.

          "description": "first off.... the code + demo:\n Repository - includes a GIF demo \n What is AmbientWeather?\n AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.\n ​\n What does your tool do?\n Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. \n If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.\n ​\n Which weather stations are supported?\n Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.\n ​\n What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?\n What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.\n ​\n Anything else?\n So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups.

PiVPN is using Wireguard and is set to use the PiHole as DNS. \n When I connect a wireguard client, I see the client's DNS requests on the PiHole admin panel. For example, oauth.reddit.com shows up as a fulfilled DNS request from a .pivpn client. However, the client never displays the web page. `wg show` and the Wireguard phone app show that packets are being transferred between the VPN host and client, but the data volume is very small. \n Has anyone seen this behavior before? Is there anything I should try? I have Fios.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/j3g  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can disconnect from wifi and reconnect and it works fine for 10-20 minutes and then starts having the same problem.\n Even though I have my client configured to use my dnsmasq server only (which then forwards requests it doesn't know to an external server,) it still inevitably ends up looking to Cloudflare instead of dnsmasq.\n I'm so confused as to why it would work for a bit and then just stop, especially since I'm telling my client to only talk to dnsmasq in this instance.

They're arguably one of the most recognizable names in domain registration/websites etc. I didn't have any problems with them; until I did. I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night trying to sort out an issue that should be simple. The person on the phone was obviously following their support script and I don't blame them for that, but how many times do we need to re-create the issue before you escalate it? I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say \"2SV\", is not well implemented in their system.\n For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. \n So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/ChillPill89  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I noticed that sometime within the last month or so most of the data on my two hard drives have become corrupted. I'm not sure what happened, but I can verify that it did based on an earlier cloud backup and some other backup I have on another machine. \n I was wondering what is the best way to go about having some system to routinely check if the data has become corrupted? I could hand roll some script to calculate md5 sums for each file. I also thought about making one big torrent for each hard drive so I can verify the checksums that way. Are there any other standard methods of doing so?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/angel---___  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm now at a point where I feel like the next few services I want to get running would involve long-term data storage, so attaching several disks for backup purposes would be essential\n My question is: how feasible would it be to attach drives through usb?

          "description": "Hi All,\n I am trying to figure out if this makes sense and if I am on the right track. Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. \n I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. \n Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this? I have looked around (Google) but if anyone has done this (or something similar), has a better alternative or can point to a good guide I appreciate the feedback.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/PavlovaoftheParallel  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.\n Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.\n    submitted by    /u/Losoncziterimenekult  \n [link]   [comments]",

Let's talk docker.\n However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.\n Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?\n Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.\n But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.\n How do you handle this issue?

          "description": "Hey, selfhosted community,\n We're excited to announce that we launched Automatisch, an open-source Zapier alternative. We have been working on it for more than a year together with u/farukaydin and started to get early adopters. Now it's time to announce it to more prominent communities.\n In case you don't know what Zapier is, it is a product that allows end users to integrate the web applications they use and automate workflows.\n If you want to check it out directly, you can use the following links:\n Website: automatisch.io\n Docs: automatisch.io/docs\n GitHub: https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch\n If you want to check out the screenshots of the product:\n  \nApps\n Flows\n Editor\n Executions\n Execution details\n  \nThere are existing solutions like Zapier or Make in the market, but we still wanted to build Automatisch as an open-source alternative because you can keep your data on your own servers with Automatisch. It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.\n You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.\n Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.\n ​\n Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.\n    submitted by    /u/barinali  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:\n Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.\n Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.\n I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.\n From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.\n Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.\n (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)\n    submitted by    /u/mfsb-vbx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.\n It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.\n My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. \n Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line?

          "description": "Hi,\n I've been trying to bypass Wi-Fi blocks at a place I go to frequently. I have my own server at home or on Azure to run it.\n I've tried OpenVPN and Wireguard (with algo). OpenVPN refuses to connect and Wireguard connects however I cannot search or directly connect to IPs (it does work on other networks.) Another thing I've noticed is that I'm able to connect to my Minecraft server, but not join as it cannot connect to Mojang's authentication servers. I'm not completely sure of how the block works though, since I am unable to connect to any VPNs on that port. Let me also point out, Hotspot Shield's \"Hydra\" protocol is able to bypass these blocks but I'm not paying for a VPN if I know there is some way out there to bypass these blocks.\n From what I know:\n The network has its own DNS, using Google's or Cloudflare's just results in a \"The connection reset\" page instead of the block placeholder page. The network also has it's own search domain (on macOS)\n If you have any questions about the requirements, let me know and I'll reply to the best of my ability.\n    submitted by    /u/guest6687654  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I can I share these /download for them.\n I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.\n My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.\n Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.\n The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/true_heart  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the outset I knew that deliverability would be an issue but now, even with all appropriate records set up (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, PTR) and server configured correctly, messages are still go straight to spam (GMail).\n My mail server is hosted by DigitalOcean and I've learned that entire ranges of their IP addresses have been blacklisted. I've tried assigning different Reserved IPs to mail server but so far it's no help. One obvious option is to try moving the mail server to a different provider entirely, but I'm not sure which providers have good reputation AND are cost effective AND will allow sending. I'm open to suggestions on this.\n Another option I was considering is using a third-party for sending since the larger players tend to have excellent reputation. But I'm not sure if this can work for my service. With services like SendGrid and MailGun, domains and senders need to be validated. My service allows users to create multiple profiles (senders) — I alone have ~180 — so limits on such services would probably be reached very quickly. If sending from custom domains these services require adding DNS records, but this wouldn't be appropriate in my case as the records would have references to the third-party domains.\n What would be the best option to ensure email delivery?\n Any useful suggestions welcome.

I have learned a few things along the way with the help of guides, forums and reddit. \n Today I setup a reverse proxy so my friends could use Overseerr without exposing my IP address. It isn't that I didn't trust my friends, but mainly because my IP address changes so often from my IP that I didn't like getting messages that \"it's broken\". But I do know it is bad practice to let people know what your IP is.\n This is the first taste I have setting up a reverse proxy, though I setup Wireguard with Duck DNS to be able to access my server outside the network in the past.\n I believed I setup everything correctly in Nginx and applied the SSL certificate to the domain that was created for Overseerr. The only issue that I am running into is through Chrome I get an warning, \"Deceptive site ahead\". Edge and Firefox does not show this warning. After some googling people generally say that it is a Duck DNS problem, and after using no-ip to create a domain, it does appear that way as I get no warning when using the no-ip domain to access Overseerr. I don't want to use no-ip as you have to renew the domain every 30 days and I don't think I can set it up to automatically update my IP address when it changes (this could be a lack of knowledge). \n I was wondering if there is a way to fix this issue. Currently I have Overseerr, Duck DNS, and Nginx all as dockers inside my Unraid server. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/knoll126  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.\n I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say \"home.laxweasel\" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.\n I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.\n However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.\n Thoughts/experiences?

This allows them to be able to track their time left for the day that they can have on their devices/screens.\n Backstory: We have many devices through the house including TVs, Consoles, Phones, Tablets, etc… There are many built-in device tools (like iOS Screen Time), but they don’t take into account devices outside their ecosystem. This meant that I had to regulate their times individually, and we can have up-to 5 children at a time from 7 to 14 years old at home. This is when I decided to come up with a simple time tracking app, and they love it more than me telling them it’s time to get off their devices. T…",

I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.\n This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.\n    submitted by    /u/qwacko  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.\n In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.\n Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).\n I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.\n TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise\n    submitted by    /u/DropkickFish  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd also like to have it specify who it's for, who the log was recorded by, basically exactly what our booklet does. Is there something like that out there?

Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.\n Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.\n However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).\n This is what I've tried so far:\n ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } \n }\n server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server \"the-container-name\"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } \n } ```\n The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?\n I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.\n I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.\n    submitted by    /u/detuneattune  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wound up doing it via Apple as it was easy to just send a link to everyone but I was wondering how a true self hoster would deal with this. I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. \n Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with. Uploading to photoprism via WebDAV is intuitive and works from phones or computers\n Feel free to ignore my options and just suggestion your own.\n    submitted by    /u/pulmonarypenguin16  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.\n Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/squirrelhoodie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.\n Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.\n Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/funfungo0dg0od  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. \n But there are a few basic things missing, like:\n - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata\n - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like \"turn image 90 degrees\")\n - simple file and folder operations like \"copy\" or \"move\"\n Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! \n But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. \n PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.\n For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. \n Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.\n I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 \"trash can\" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).\n So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. \n A couple questions:\n What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?\n My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?\n I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).\n Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!\n Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.\n    submitted by    /u/docholoday  \n [link]   [comments]",

So basically, I have VM hosts in my DC and want to setup a website to log into, and click on the server and it will launch a RDP session in a sense. I also want to make this available for a few users that want to run \"test labs\". I know in Windows Server you can setup an RD Gateway and host a site to set a group of RDS servers for people to log into. Would that be the best way of doing it? I've set it up before, been a while, but can definitely do it again if that is the easiest way. But I would have to have RDS licensing for it. Was trying to avoid that part of it. But if I can't, then I will buy them. Just curious as to if anyone else has this kind of setup already? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/John-Kennex  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using openvpn to my home network means that traffic is exposed to my home internet ISP. SO in this case I understand I could use a reverse proxy to solve it. Say using my phone > mullvad vpn > nginx (for example) > one of my docker containers. This would give applications a secure way to login without directly exposing them to the internet, right? Would it be possible to host this reverse proxy on the same server that hosts my services? Is this advisable or am I better off with a premade solution from say cloudflare? I do have access to one of those free oracle cloud instances but I think the download bandwidth is capped pretty low on them, while upload is not, so it would probably run out of data acting as a tunnel for all of my data, streaming 4k movies or whatever.

          "description": "Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.\n The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.\n So the procedure:\n  \nCreate a new folder in your APP / Server, for example \"Mobile Photos\".\n Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload\n Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and \"Configure\".\n Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option \"The original file will....\".\n Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)\n Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.\n Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.\n  \nProblems:\n  \nFor some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.\n I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a \"Photo Folder\", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.\n  \nSo hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "(before you say Monica I have looked into it and while it's super nice not entirely what I am looking for).\n The problem:\n Our family has someone who has the information for the doctor and someone has the password for the EZpass login and another person has the document for the latest power bill. We are looking for a system that can contain off of this.\n I am hoping to find a Self Hosted (hopefully FOSS) application that we can use as a CRM for our family. We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).\n My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.\n What I have looked at and dismissed:\n  \nHomechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.\n Monica - This is for tracking personal connections. While cool, not exactly what I am looking for.\n 'Real' CRMs - hubu, itflowly, salesforce, etc. These are just way to over the top and expensive\n  \n​\n Edit: A workable solution was determined so far, but still open to ideas: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ypt9hh/comment/ivm4mm6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n    submitted by    /u/webtron18  \n [link]   [comments]",

We primarily use it for our kids but we are slowly building out our own library via EBay and dollar bins. \n My thoughts were with the insane improvements to CPUs with the new generations that I should upgrade (first major upgrade ever). So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. \n So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). \n So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries.

But I am thinking of expanding up to 10 TB but I want some redundancy like perhaps having two 10 TB in maybe RAID 1 mirror mode. My idea is that have two hard drives one acting as a backup. Performance is not a concern since most movies don't go past 1080P and there are no more than 3 concurrent streams. I use a hp g800 mini which is serving quite well and I have had no complaints with streaming or content quality drops even in different countries. \n Since performance isn't an issue my idea is I use Unix command line as the OS of the machine. The hard drives would be in NTFS format. I am wondering if there is any specific setup for this. Would I need some sort of NAS or a software solution that would be preferred without investing in additional hardware?

Here are the rules:\n action,protocol,port,source\n accept,ssh,22,0.0.0.0/0\n accept,TCP(HTTP),80,0.0.0.0/0\n accept,TCP(HTTPS),443,0.0.0.0/0\n accept,TCP,9000,server.ip/32 #portainer\n accept,UDP,51820,0.0.0.0/0 #vaultwarden\n drop,any,0-65535,0.0.0.0/0 #default\n ​\n Racknerd doesn't seem to have a firewall page on the webui.

As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.\n I could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.\n I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...\n Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...\n I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:\n - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?\n - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.\n I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.\n Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?\n ​\n Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/Biidouille  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Please bear with me, this an involved posting. I have searched all over and have not come up with even a partial solution that would be self-hosted.\n I live in a WISP environment (Wireless Internet Service Provider), which I have no control over the WiFi APs. My access to the outside world is through WiFi using a router in a wifi bridge mode; no Ethernet connections are available. The architecture of the WISP system, WPA2-Enterprise, allows other apartments to connect to the AP in my apartment which has several SSIDs. Every apartment has an AP in it and act similarly.\n What I am looking for is a Monitoring/Analytics solution which gathers continuous passive WiFi environment information over time such as WiFi slowdowns, WiFi outages, number of WiFi clients attached to an AP MAC address, signal levels, number of WiFi disconnects/reconnects, etc. This is similar to what could be obtained by using Kismet with a filter to gather real time statistics. I would also like to not run out of disk space over a week if at all possible.\n Does any solution for this problem exist? Or, alternatively, could something like this be cobbled together from existing self-hosted parts? Thanks for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/linuxweenie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am also, unfortunately, at the intersection of \"worried about security\" and \"don't know enough to know what enough security is\". I really didn't like the fact that docker ignored my firewall rules and opened ports on the iptables, so I made a custom bridge network and didn't publish any ports. In this way, I had hoped to be able to solely publish ports 80 and 443, routing everything else through the custom docker network. This felt safer. The massive problem with this is that it works - kind of. I can generally get to a service, but not always. However, if I get to them, they will be intermittent at best. They drop a LOT of communications via time out. I tried netdata to see if the system was struggling - seems not at all. I took the services out of the bridge network and published the ports normally - everything works great. This makes me assume I did something wrong on the network.

The way I have it right now feels kinda wonky.\n Jellyseer doesn't update the request status, ever, it always says \"requested\", but things do get added to their respective *arr apps. But then, the *arr app may not find what I want, even tho I can go into prowlarr, manually search for it, and find it immediately. Why is that?\n Also, I have configured qbittorrent to do sequential downloads. That way I can see the Linux ISO form right in front of my eyes, byte by byte, which lets me enjoy it as soon as it begins downloading.\n The problem with that, is that the *arr apps won't move the file until it's completely finished downloading, so Jellyfin doesn't see it. I set up a workaround by adding qbit download folder to Jellyfin, and that works, and I can start watching immediatly, but it's wonky, and things aren't properly separated.\n Has someone done something similar?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

The concept is, it only takes a millisecond or two to generate config files on the fly, so why not do that. Any important information, such as domain names and user names are stored in a single json file. I wrote a tool in rust which takes this information and inserts it into config templates. A single command installs the software, then the whole thing is already working.\n The web control panel is an optional package, and each service is also a separate package, you only install what you need. I wrote an install script with a menu to make it easy. The install script will also have an autonomous mode which can install the required packages without any interaction, which makes it easy to use with docker.\n I'm still working on the web control panel and a bunch more services. Currently I have dns hosting with named/bind, web hosting with nginx, haproxy, php-fpm, and lets encrypt, and email hosting using postfix. Websites are hosted each with an independent user and nginx instance. All this is configured automatically as each service starts. I'm working on adding support for hosting minecraft servers, managing backups and zfs pools, and other services as needed.\n Aside from a few bugs I'm still working on, my own use of the software has been smooth sailing. Hoping to continue work on it and make something great. The source code is currently private, while I still have some security concerns, but can grant access on request. I have faith in open source.

Using Radicale as a backend and Tasks.org as mobile app, everything works easily. I evaluate several solutions and this is the better one: Radicale is mature and updated, tasks.org connect to it without the need of DavX5 or other things. Very very good.\n Now, the problem is that the basic docker default config of Radicale does not have any kind of users management, in the login page you just insert a name (and no pwd, even if the field exists...) and if the username exists, you are enabled to see and manage (delete too) all its items; if it does not, a new user is created!\n As said I read some docs but I do not understand too much: I just need that users should have a password and that only users I authorize can login, so no automatic user creation. It seems I have to specify \"users list\" and \"users config file\" in the \"radicale config file\"; \"users config file\" details resources access for users.\n So, the question is: how have you solved this situation? Might you publish the config files you have? I just need 3-4 private calendars for family members and one shared.\n    submitted by    /u/wireless82  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm currently running a VPS (Ubuntu) and a home server (unraid). I have loads of services, apps and self written software running on both systems. On the VPS are probably around 15 Things running.\n Anything that has a high reliability requirement and especially when it requires fast internet runs on my VPS. Currently it's a mess, things running with docker compose, things running with docker run (so the configuration is floating in space) and some things just barebone installed and running in some process managers or systemctl, messing with each other and breaking apt-get requirements.\n I'm planning to restructure everything into containerization, just unsure how. \n I have seen people use portainer (tried it, wasn't flashed), kubernetes (does that even make sense here? Sadly don't know a lot about it) or just plain docker-compose files and running commands.\n Is there some sort of guide/comparison that compares different approaches and their use cases. Would also be interested on the opinions of others, I'm really unsure about this.\n My time is fairly limited so I don't want to spend weeks trying different approaches or having to switch between them because something didn't work out.\n Thanks for any replies\n    submitted by    /u/stehen-geblieben  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "First time self hosting so bear with me. \n Setup so far: AT&T fiber, windows host, Ubuntu 22.04LTSServer guest, host Ethernet and Oracle Virtual Box.\n First hurdle: unable to get host to ping the IP seen in the guest. Default is NAT but from other posts, sounds like I need host only or Bridged mode. If I choose Bridge mode, IP shows 127.0.0.1 in host. What am I missing? Didn’t get a chance to dig deeper into this yet.\n Later on, this guest will host a web server exposed to internet. AT&T fiber’s router IP and default block remains pretty static. I am hoping to use one of the other IPs (public subnet) for the guest OS. Can I do that or the host has to be in the public subnet? Is there a way for my other machines in my private network to talk this host/guest via windows explorer or any easier way?

While also not leaving myself open to any attacks.\n I have an AWS EC2 instance up and running and have Wireguard running between it and my local network. To be more specific I have my local machine connected to the VPS. The VPS has iptables to move UDP traffic on both 16261 and 16262.\n I have also configured Traefik to forward the data to the correct server. I cannot seem to establish a connection to the game server. I have tested with both a VPN on my client to make sure I am connecting from the outside internet and without the VPN. In the diagram I want data to flow in via the blue line through all the respective connections. Then the red line out and back to the client so they can play on the server.\n I also realize that this can pose some latency issues and an inability to ban by IP. I really could care less about that. I want to mitigate DDoS or any form of attack that isn't based on an exploit in the game. If the game has an exploit then that is a whole other issue I will worry about. This is about minimizing the attack surface not the optimal way.\n https://preview.redd.it/vzjww5julex91.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6467aca37b9b897ff7388df2189779cf3f0b69c\n    submitted by    /u/IcyBlackAgeis  \n [link]   [comments]",

It does seem like UnRAID might be a good choice, but it is closed source and is paid. Not an issue that it's paid, but I disagree with it being closed source.\n ​\n I was hoping to run a couple of VMs for using Windows (Main rig is Linux only and there are some apps that are unfortunately Windows only), and a few game servers, in addition to running jellyfin, vaultwarden, qbittorrent, sftpgo, autobrr, photoprism and maybe a couple of other things should I find anything else interesting.\n ​\n Server has 32GB RAM, AMD 5 2600 CPU, no GPU, 5 8TB Ironwolf NAS drives. \n ​\n Thanks in advance!

I have a number of linux servers that I want to back up and I'm looking for a tool that works in a server-client model - i.e. I can install it on a single server from which I can manage, view and schedule backups, and the server would connect to all the different clients through ssh or an agent or something similar. I've looked at a lot of the commonly recommended backup solutions (kopia, duplicity, duplicati, etc) and they all seem to require installation and configuration per server, so I'd have to set up and install on each server individually.\n Is there anything selfhosted (short of a cronjob + rsync script) that would allow me to backup multiple servers (all linux - mostly debian with a few raspberry pis) that is centrally managed?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/themostevilchicken  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do you have any ideas for applications?\n ​\n We need:\n  \nan intranet for posting news and sharing messages (e.g. HumHub). External users should have read-only access to specific areas.\n a user database with own attributes per user and a simple user administration for technology beginners (e.g. Keycloak with a simpler user admin UI).\n email boxes that are easy to set up. An admin should simply say what name the mailbox should have and every allowed user (from the identity provider) should then have access via an email client. A ticket system is also welcome.\n a file storage (e.g. Nextcloud).\n a wiki.\n a registration form for events. The price may vary per pre-selection.\n  \n​\n The requirements are as follows:\n  \nwe have a little more than 1000 members. Each member should have their own account, which in the best case should already exist and must be provided with a password when logging in for the first time. We already have the e-mail addresses and other information in an Excel spreadsheet.\n security: if possible at least password policies and/or two-factor authentication. If the new passkeys feature is already supported, that would be even better. Also, users should be able to be logged out of all services immediately. It should also be possible for our chairperson (over 60) to assign roles to services.\n if an e-mail, name or any other attribute changes in the identity provider, this should also be changed on all other systems as soon as possible.\n  \n​\n I know C# and web development with PHP well, so I could also write smaller plugins myself. I get along reasonably well with Docker and Linux. The whole thing should run on a rented server.\n    submitted by    /u/HellOfBugs  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question:\n  \nCan an Amazon FireStick access USB storage attached to the TV? I tried installing ES File Explorer (which supports FTP) but it only sees the FireStick's internal storage.\n \nMy Samsung TV is UE40H6400 and it seems I can not connect to the Samsung servers, I'm assuming because the TV is out of support. Does anyone know where I can find a list of .apk packages that are supported on this TV? If I can install (for example) ES File Explorer on the TV instead of on the FireStick, I'm assuming that the external storage attached to the TV will appear as accessible.\n \nIs there a better way to do this? I just want to avoid having to go through the whole process of connecting my external storage to my PC, moving media to it, disconnecting and reconnecting to TV, playing the media, disconnecting and reconnecting to PC... and so on each time I want to watch something not from a streaming service.

I think the end goal is for me to self-host 'something', I'm just not sure what it would be. \n I work from home, and my wife is a stay at home mother. We have a family calendar via iCloud, and I obviously have a work calendar (I am in lots of meetings) that I can't share with her. \n I'm trying to find a way for her to schedule personal appointments (where I'd need to watch the baby while she's gone) but make sure it's not done during existing meeting I have at work. \n Right now I've tried blocking off 2 x 3 hour windows each week, but that's not really feasible as they mostly go unused by her, and I need to be able to schedule calls during them. \n So I need to find some way to either anonymize my work meetings and upload them to a shared calendar so she can figure out when 'not' to schedule her appointments, or find a way so the appointments she schedules for herself end up on my work calendar. \n I've got the ability to self host anything I need to to help make this happen, I'm just not sure if such a thing is even possible, let alone what products/technologies I might need to pull it off.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a single host (10.1.10.10) running 20+ docker containers. One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). \n Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The \"internal\" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). \n Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. \n My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. \n Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes. Any ideas? \n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/Jyncus  \n [link]   [comments]",

As it seems i have the following options\n Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud\n I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.\n I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my \"server\".\n What do you think?

I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.\n I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.\n I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:\n  \nMedia Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.\n An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.\n If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.\n Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)\n  \nIt does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Kayfabe10  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did my DD and read all the Reddit posts that I could find on the topic.

Not sure what to call it, but something to keep track of who gave us what so that we can send out thank-yous\n Simple website to display travel instructions, FAQs, etc\n Photo Uploader - An app or website where guests can upload photos to a shared folder that we can access. I might set up another instance of nextcloud with anonymous uploads just for this, unless there is something better?\n Photo Gallery - For after the wedding if we want to share photos.\n \nContacts updater - For people who we don't have contact info for, we'd send them a link to some sort of form for them to provide their mailing address. Worst case we can probably use google forms for this.\n  \nI have a few ideas for some of these things, but would appreciate any ideas everyone has!

This is nifty because it protects crappy PHP web applications against unauthenticated attacks since no traffic is allowed to the application until the user is authenticated.\n I've done my research but most of the solutions I've found (Authelia, Authentik, etc) only seem to support proxying underlying web application when using HTTP Basic authentication. As soon as you're talking about using OAuth2 or something else modern the flow always seems to revert to going to the web application and then clicking the login button. This opens them up to unauthenticated attacks again.\n Am I missing something obvious or does anyone have any ideas?\n Thanks in advance!\n Good [User] -> [Proxy] -> [SSO] -> [App] Also Good [User] -> [Proxy] -> [App] ^ [SSO] Bad [User] -> [Proxy] ┬> [App] └> [SSO] \n    submitted by    /u/Agarax  \n [link]   [comments]",

At work we have a lab that was setup before I started and they manually install vsphere/k8s(rancher) with out of tree management. This allows for spinning up VMs to be used as part of the cluster from rancher.\n However I noticed that rancher is spun up in a k8s cluster that is formed insider a docker container.\n IE docker-run->k8s cluster generated->rancher installed. This is a one liner from rancher for development testing. Then we have downstream clusters spun up inside vsphere via ranchers GUI.\n The reason for all this is \"Cloud Agnostic\", so we're not using a managed k8s service AKS/EKS etc.\n Anyway I was setting up a new home lab before I had an old r710 server with proxmox and did a lot of manual configuration, vm creation not fun.\n My new setup is 3 dell thin clients with proxmox all joined to a DC. Now aside from manually installing proxmox which I could've automated with PXE boot *I plan on testing PXE boot deploys now that I have proxmox setup*. I'd prefer not to be manually spinning up containers I know portainer is a popular tool for this but I'm considering a k8s enviroment. \n What's your go to method for bootstrapping k8s? I know k8s is overkill for self-hosted but it's what's used at work so I'd like to make it more part of my daily.\n    submitted by    /u/sorieus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a DC as well for permissions. I find it a bit strange that no one seems to talk about that on here or even really consider it as an option. Of course, on top of that, I also have Owncloud with my Windows file shares mounted so that I can more easily access files with mobile devices or outside of my home. I just find that I access my files almost solely through my Windows explorer and a Windows File Server seems to be the best option.

          "description": "I have researched this many times over the years and find more and more great solutions emerging each year. I stopped hosting in 2015 because I moved to a location with no broadband internet and the best solution I had was a tethered cell phone with terrible speed and CGNAT. Now I have T-mobile unlimited home internet with 130-230 down and 20-35 up. So I have the speed for it, but still no port forwarding.\n Now here are the solutions and resources research has pointed out to me. Just curious which of them are better choices in current times. I will be hosting multiple VM's/containers including plex to a few users for music and occasional video. Also hosting cloud storage for a few cell phones to store photos and videos for freeing up local storage on devices. And home assistant which I currently pay the cloud fee for and that cost can go towards a more global solution\n ngrok - already using the free one of this for plex which is great. Wish the paid version was priced down a little more, but still open to it.\n cloudflare - looks very popular and similar to ngrok and priced similar.\n localXpose - have not tried but looks similar to ngrok, but more affordable.\n portmap io - looks to be like the above but uses openvpn to which I could setup on my router directly.\n openvpn to a friend/family router to use there ipv4 port forwarding and free DDNS - This is probably what I would have done years ago before the tunneling solutions above became mainstream. Honestly still open to this too though.\n VPS with VPN - have only lightly researched this one. Was going to test on my free AWS account, but read that it gets expensive if much data is uses across AWS, so would need a cheaper host.\n unknown - A wiser choice I am overlooking?\n    submitted by    /u/dominatorstang  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Mattermost is very similar to Slack/Teams--but it does not have a persistent voice room the way that Discord/Mumble does, so I am using a plugin for that. The plugin was recently archived on Github, but I tried the same version from the most recent release along with the version of Mattermost that would have been the most recent at the time, and I am having the same problem as the person does in this Issue thread (The heading of the voice channel area appears, but the actual channels do not populate).\n I am running Debian 10 on Digital Ocean, and PostgreSQL (I didn't think the db mattered, but I had never heard of that, and I only used it because I was following along someone else's instructions and they used it, so I thought I'd mention that).\n https://i.imgur.com/3XleCd1.png\n The solution that worked for the issue I posted above was that they had to add the listen port into the setting for the site URL. I opened this port, and I tried all combinations of versions of the Mattermost client + plugin, with and without this port in the URL, HTTP and HTTPS, and I am losing my mind not knowing what else to try. I am very new to Linux and very new to server configurations, so I just don't even know where to begin troubleshooting. Only now as I type this I realize that I never tried to downgrade the server, which could work.... If anyone has any tips on doing this with as little damage as possible, I would love the words of advice. \n Also, the log file does not appear to have anything terribly helpful or out of place. It all looks to be loading the modules as normal with no issues. There are a ton of log files in my Mattermost folder, if there is a specific one I should focus on for this and look more closely at, please share.\n Or if anything jumps out at you that I could try before I downgrade the server, that would be great as well.\n    submitted by    /u/pensivetomatillo  \n [link]   [comments]",

A \"file manager web ui/app\" that can show image thumbs and allow me to more quickly (batch) manage the files on the bucket would be a dream.

I have taken a liking to running software as containers and particularly taken a liking to Podman due to just how easy it is to get going running unprivileged containers and some other nifty things such as systemd integration and generate/play kube.\n My first old server is under very heavy load, has no dedicated GPU and runs Plex in a Windows VM. I've been thinking of migrating Plex to this RHEL9 rig. What are the pros and cons of running Plex on Linux as a native RPM package vs a podman container? Some people report trouble getting NVIDIA hardware acceleration to work with Podman, but looking at various instructions it doesn't seem THAT hard (although obviously a fair bit more involved than just having NVIDIA drivers installed).\n What about the required NVIDIA container runtime, does it essentially replace the runtime provided by Podman or does it only affect containers specifically utilizing NVIDIA hardware? How well supported things are, is it safe to just have the system automatically update all OS updates + NVIDIA drivers (DKMS) + NVIDIA container-related packages?\n    submitted by    /u/-quakeguy-  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I decided to fork Guide2go and add the features that, I believe, were missing.\n So far, I added:\n — The EPG guide includes a Live/New icon for premiere shows and movies. Guide2Go does this natively, however, players like Titivate won't read XML tags. This solves that problem.\n — Added an EPG server. Now, Guide2Go will grab images from SD and act as a server for those images; it will download the images and cache them locally to avoid kill calling SD API. This is very useful for clients like Plex or Emby. Very similar to what 123EPG does (Actually, not similar, but the same feature).\n — Added the option to not download the images locally, but to call SD API every time a client needs an image. This is useful if you only have one or two clients with few EPG days downloaded. If you have many channels, this will not work for you. SD has a limit in the number of images that can be downloaded directly.\n ​\n I accept constructive criticism in the Code, I am not a developer by any means.

          "description": "I run a smallish tech firm. We do many things including computer repair(even board level repair), software troubleshooting, etc. While we have a fair number of residential customers, we've also got a number of commercial clients for whom we do not only the aforementioned, but also managed backups. A typical client setup would be a Synology Diskstation to match their needs along with a Synology C2 cloud account. We have their workstations use Synology's 'Active Backup for Business' which will backup workstations on our schedule with whichever backup scheme we set up. The NAS itself will use Synology's 'Hyper Backup' to then back itself up to the Synology C2 cloud storage - whew... that's a lot of Synology stuff, and I rather dislike that.\n I'd rather have something less monolithic in the event Synology changes something down the road(for example pricing), forcing me to change gears. Given the above use case, what would be your go-to setup?\n Follow-up question: In my office, I too use a Synology DS, and with that I also use the Synology Office productivity suite which I would describe as 'decent, but no Google Docs'. Do you all have any luck with NextCloud with regards to a Google replacement? What type of hardware do you run?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Pleaseclap4  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.\n Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.\n How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.\n Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE?

The room is accessible from inside the house and has an thru-wall fan exhausting into the garage. It doesn't have any dedicated cooling.\n I used double louvered doors with a 1/2\" gap at the bottom, hoping this would allow air to be pulled in from the rest of the house.\n The fan on the back wall is a AC Infinity AIRFRAME T7-N exhausting into the garage.\n The rest of the house is usually kept around 70F. The server room stays around 80F in front of the rack and 90F behind the rack. At one point, I tried creating a hot/cold aisle with foam board, but I only noticed a 1-2 degree difference at best. \n In the original design, I intended to put shelving on the walls of the server room and use it for bulk food storage/pantry, but I'd need the temperature to be closer to <70F for that. What could I do to lower the temperature of the room? I've considered cutting a hole in the wall for a window AC unit (exhausting into the garage), but I'd prefer to cool with airflow from the rest of the house if possible.

In the past, I've installed software by hand, but this time wanted to focus on Docker.\n I followed the tutorial by highspeed_usaf and got SWAG and Cloudflare's tunnel working. I added NextCloud, Portainer, SearxNG, and Doku. Everything is working fine and SSL is working too even though, I'm not sure I really set it up (using SSL via CloudFlare).\n Anyway, NextCloud's security check is giving me a lot of warnings. Before, when I installed NC by hand, I was able to get rid of all the warnings and such. However, because I'm running NC via Docker, I'm not quite sure what to do. \n I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'm still not sure what the process is when I get such errors. Do I change files within the container itself? Or is there a better way to do this?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/damullens  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I picked up free three servers from my old college’s e-waste bin. It appears they were custom built from Canadian company for audio production.\n All of them are using iStarUSA D-300 3U rackmount chassis with C2D setup with some special audio capture and ASUS GeForce 8400 GS Fanless cards. I decided remove all existing hardware components in the servers because their motherboard and PSU are dead due to leaked capacitors. I gave away one of them to my friend.\n Then, I installed two servers chassis with old and. new hardwares I have:\n  \n Chinese X99 board with Xeon E5-2640 v3, 32GB DDR4 ECC REG, and 12TB (4x3TB SAS HDD) RAID setup. It is currently running Unraid.\n  Supermicro X79 dual socket board with two Xeon E5-2620 v2, 64GB DRR3 ECC REG, and 500GB SSD SATA. It is currently running Proxmox.\n  \nNow, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?\n P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.\n P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports. I will post photo of setup in comment this tonight.)\n    submitted by    /u/BatteryDie  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. \n I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. \n The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. \n My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. \n After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. \n I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. \n Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?\n Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. \n If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. \n My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Zeb_ra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is the one that typically handles it so I am a little in the dark about things.\n I have a very vague idea of what would be needed for a home server, but I could be way off the mark. \n With Christmas coming up I wanted to get her something to mess with when it comes to having her own home server for just our friend group. We spoke lightly on the subject of just getting a home server. The interest is there, the knowledge is lacking, so having kind of a cheap starter setup seems like a decent enough way to go. \n As for games, we would most likely have mod Minecraft, V Rising, Farming simulator, terraria, ect.\n We would typically have less than 10 people at any time, and the interests of the group swaps almost monthly in a rotation of games. So probably wouldn't need to be running multiple servers at once, but just have the ability to switch between them. \n Thanks in advance for helping a well intentioned oblivious husband.\n    submitted by    /u/Kitrollo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.\n I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.\n What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.\n MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/\n Many thanks in advance.\n TL;DR Exchange Server for Absolute Bargain Bin Level Idiots Guides Plz\n    submitted by    /u/SirWobbyTheFirst  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I came up with was taking 2 DirecTV DECA adapters, I took an antronix power inserter and used it to deinsert power so I could split it to the two DECA devices, but I found out that there are no existing splitters on the market that power pass on more than one point simultaneously so I had to make my own DC splitter by taking an old crappy splitter prying the glued back off and cutting out the magnet wire and ferrites and soldered a piece of copper wire between all the ports. Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible. I only really ever used the device for testing, I never got around to installing it as I intended and then I went back to Comcast and the coax was no longer dead so it sat in a box until I found it today.\n https://preview.redd.it/by3i8md3zs0a1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=080a7005c5809341fb7828f27cbed12c6ec47815\n    submitted by    /u/blufeb95  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Newbie here seeking for advice. I recently got a DL380 Gen9 from Ebay to start my homelab. After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.\n Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!\n  \nThe server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?\n The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?\n The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/_xulion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The recent power price increases have hit our country hard, and a discussion with the CEO and CFO at Chez Knurpel led to a review of the heavy power users. Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.\n The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)\n Sorry, lights out\n    submitted by    /u/Knurpel  \n [link]   [comments]",

I requested an update only to receive a delayed response 1 week later that it could take up to 10 days to process the order (This was already day 10). \n Fast forward to when the drives arrive; packaging seemed ok. I tested them one by one and discovered 1/6 was DOA, the 5/6 booted but when I tried to take a SMART, it simply wouldn't perform the TEST. It wasn't that there was an error per se, it simply wouldn't perform the test. \n Weary of putting any data on the 5/6 drives even if they recognize. I email their support regarding the issue looking for a resolution. No real response for a week until they sent an email that it was forwarded to their 'IT\" department; however what was weird was the ticket was 'closed'. \n I emailed again to reopen the ticket 3-4 days later but no response. I emailed again another 3-4 days later with the same result. They are simply ignoring the support ticket even though there is a DOA Warranty for 30 days. I'm well paste the 30days and had to pay UPS customs/duties of $185. \n BUYER BEWARE: I heard good things about these guys from the serverbuild forums years ago and thought I would give them a try.

I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct? Any decent places to pick up some ram?\n    submitted by    /u/Senior-Dare-8590  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to get some thoughts on a setup to segregate my network a little bit using my current ASUS ac3100 router. I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.\n Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense\n Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.\n Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Khormid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.\n Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)\n This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.\n For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.\n After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?\n And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.\n    submitted by    /u/xRoguestatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)\n I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:\n 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)\n 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives\n I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process\n Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently? ( In the future I want to add PCIe NVMe drives for faster storage just as a side note) Any insight is appreciated and thanks everyone\n    submitted by    /u/RealPhoenixUnBound  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).\n I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?\n So there are two possibilities:\n  \nmy 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;\n I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^\n  \nI hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either.

Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.\n CPU: AMD 5600X\n Desired setup:\n  \n2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0\n 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.\n 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot\n 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.\n  \nDrive quantity:\n  \n8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.\n 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.\n 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.\n  \nSo the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.\n I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.\n Thanks a lot for any guidance!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.\n I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.\n I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?\n Is it also worth looking into other file systems? I just use normal ext4, but I've heard people talk about using ZFS instead, but I don't know much about it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ElnuDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.\n So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .\n But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :\n https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms\n Or you could go back to X86.\n Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.\n You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.\n Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for \"pfsense router\".\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/841ft3v2ckz91.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac555579191683e56468092b6d1fefd7c4fea74\n This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. \n What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.\n    submitted by    /u/EspurrStare  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all.\n I've been attempting to build myself a homelab, with a proper server, alongside my TL-SG108E, Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) and Pi Zero v1.3.\n I recently came across this server on Facebook Marketplace (for 200 EUR):\n  \nHP ProLiant DL360p Gen 8 \n 2x Xeon E5-2630 (6c/12t per CPU) @ 2.3 GHz\n 64 GB ECC RAM\n Quad 1 GB NIC\n Raid Controller (changed to HBA) - 120 GB SSD + 2x 300 GB 10K SAS\n \n  \nI had a friend tell me that they wouldn't get this stating that its a Gen 8 the processor, the specs, and RAM are low. But the issue is I am on a budget for a server (so I can create projects, AD environment, etc. (for testing, as I work in security)). I am wondering if the server is worth the price for a beginner/first server. I plan to run Proxmox and spin up pfSense and other stuff that might help with network segmentation, etc.\n Additionally, the seller offered to install a clean version of Windows Server 2016 and give me remote RDP access and ILO access to check the specs out. I plan on using Hard Disk Sentinel to get an idea about the disks' state and health, but what else should I do to make sure the server is solid (without defects, etc.) before purchase?\n I'd sincerely appreciate any help.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Arszilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has yet to be addressed.\n Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.\n In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:\n  \nThe UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.\n The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.\n  \nI'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.\n Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.\n    submitted by    /u/curlybrian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.\n Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.\n My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):\n https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US\n I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.\n Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?\n    submitted by    /u/Vchat20  \n [link]   [comments]",

So why would I want to make a router or even need a dedicated firewall box?\n    submitted by    /u/erik530195  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm new to cluster/stack so my original idea is that I setup a kube environment and run VMs on top, but I don't think that would work. (If I only run server images using docker engine without the need of GUI maybe) So my revised plan is installing Proxmox to each Pi4 node creating a Proxmox cluster.\n My only reason for this is thst I can chuck as many PI4s inside a full ATX case minimizing heat and power consumption. I live in a shared appt so my current is acutally inside my room.\n Have anyone done this before?\n    submitted by    /u/theONLYhotpotato  \n [link]   [comments]",

Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way?

          "description": "Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.\n With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.\n What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).\n Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.\n Thanks All!\n    submitted by    /u/Lxr200  \n [link]   [comments]",

I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.\n My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.\n From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.\n I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:\n MikroTik\n QNAP\n I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).\n    submitted by    /u/giorivpad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been too busy with life the last decade to play with computers, but free time has re-entered my life, and I recently got a server to start learning things with. I discovered I have an extra internet connection while putting it in my closet, and then after getting proxmox setup, and trying to setup a dynamic dns service for the domain I bought, I realized my home router also had a private IP address.\n Both connections have the same public IP of *.*.254.228, and tracert shows 4 hops between the device I connect with, to a public IP that is very similar, one more within my ISP, then out into the internet.\n Between my device and the ISP are:\n 1 10.32.9.1 (10.32.9.1)\n 2 192.168.89.1 (192.168.89.1\n 3 172.16.254.1 (172.16.254.1)\n 4 *.*.com (*.*.166.225)\n So after a little digging I'm wondering if what I'm dreaming up is possible.\n Link aggregation on pfsense, with a split SSH tunnel on each connection, that connects to a VPS server with a static IP my domain will point at, that runs a proxy server that points subdomains to my services, and balances the load down each connection.\n I could do all these things on their own, and would put more effort into the details of link aggregation and reverse proxies as they are the only new things I'm working with, but I decided to throw a question out here before I spend hours digging around to find it's not possible to do all together like I'm thinking.\n    submitted by    /u/Sure_Opportunity  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.\n Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.\n The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.\n Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).\n My question:\n  \nJust how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.\n \nAre there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)\n \nAny other potential issues?\n \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.\n I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.\n I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?\n In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk).

          "description": "Hi everyone, I just got my first piece of homelab hardware yesterday and installed ProxMox into it without major issue. After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.\n I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?\n Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)\n    submitted by    /u/BigWillyHaverer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thus, I wanted to write down all my thoughts on my experience so far to gather opinions and suggestions.\n But first a bit of introduction. I am 25 years old, passionate about tech but not really expert about IT. Always used windows for school and gaming and recently became more conscious about owning my own data, it being by not using cloud storages, and paying for media I will not really own. On top of that, the recent world developments, geopolitically and in company strategies, made me more privacy conscious than before. PS: I have never used linux extensively …",

I've read online that they read and write far less errors than SATA equivalent drives do during the drive's lifespan. Hypothetically that would imply less RAID array failures when using Parity right?

In any scenario where there is a media server, the idea/goal is to get the content to direct play on the client side. Typically the client devices are an nvidia shield or an apple TV and 95% of the time I'd say those devices direct play (they are hard wired). They seem to only switch to transcoding when subtitles are involved or if the audio stream needs to be changed for some reason.\n I'm looking to see which NUC and/or if a mac mini would act as a good server if it ever had to transcode. The last thing I want to do is recommend a 1k server device and have it lock up while transcoding.\n Some additional information\n  \nno remote users, only local play (meaning, the library is not shared and won't have other family/friends streaming/transcoding/etc)\n very rare that more than one stream will be active at a time\n decent amount of UHD content, but being on the LAN (all devices are wired) as long as the client can direct play, I don't see 4k being an issue\n  \nI wasn't sure where else to post this because this is more of a hardware question vs a media server question. For transcoding purposes, am I looking for something with a built in video card or is the CPU more critical? Or both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Afternoon legends,\n I've currently got my Unraid server in a 4U case (Silverstone RM400)\n in my rack, running a Ryzen 5 3600/32gb RAM,GTX 1070+drives). ie, standard server.\n I've recently gotten my hands on some free stuff from a mate. An i9 9900K, Strix ATX motherboard and 32gb RAM. I've been wanting to create a second server with a higher clock speed for things like dedicating game servers, instead of using Windows VM's within Unraid, due to the Windows processing/RAM overhead.\n Additional things I'll need will be Case, PSU, CPU Cooler. I'll add an existing drive I have.\n My initial thoughts were another 4U case, but I wanted to keep costs down, and I likely will only have 1 drive in it so seems like a big waste of space.\n 3U or 2U cases could work, but I don't know about their height clearance for CPU coolers, and they don't seem that much cheaper. I could even look into cheap cases off aliexpress as I could probably wait (but shipping is crazy $$ to Australia)\n I thought about an old PC tower off marketplace, reuse the PSU, cooler and lie the case on it's side. But not sure about height/width or aesthetics. Is there a minimalist rack case I can add an ATX board to?\n I'd love to know your thoughts/tips on the best way to add/build this second server?\n    submitted by    /u/boourns180  \n [link]   [comments]",

The big guns at work are in the somewhat early stages of setup and I want to learn it so I can know what's going on.\n I wanted to just see if I could get a list of computers from Azure AD. I just tried to connect by working with Microsoft Graph. Following Microsoft's docs I got to the sign in part with setting the scope. It prompted me about making changes for the organization. Obviously I cancelled the sign in real quick. I could ask the other guys but I want to know a little before doing so. I was going to purchase some courses on Udemy or somewhere but none of them are working examples. Staring at Powerpoint slides with nothing to refer to is not helpful.\n I have a MSDN subscription so I get $50 a month of Azure that I haven't used a dollar of for the past I don't know how many years. Obviously I also have a full Windows home lab in my home lab environment. Running commands like above I would have to issue running in my home lab.\n As I said I am starting from ground 0 mind you. Do you have any suggestions or links that could help me? Any courses? Any help would be appreciated.\n One more thing I've been tasked for 2023 to start managing our on-prem devices with Intune and patching from Intune.

What is reason for choosing your remote access setup and why is your way more secure than the next guys way.\n My remote access setup! I chose not to use a VPN, I created a domain name, used cloud flare for dns, setup a Ubuntu VM on my proxmox with cloudron image, and use Apache guacamole. Keep in mind I had to use my public IP for DNS, then I forward port 80,443 from my router to my Ubuntu VM.\n Problem, I don’t like the exposure and with cloudron they recommend not updating the image as they push their own security updates to the machine every night. Is this good or bad to rely on someone else to patch any new vulns or is it better that way since I’ll more than likely be late applying any patches.\n I really don’t like having any open ports on my ingress but seems like to remote access any network this needs to happen.\n Questions, comments, SECURITY CONCERNS?\n P.S. thanks in advance, looking forward to all the wisdom\n    submitted by    /u/According_Speed_2081  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is depending on what SSD's i can find and to what price.\n The SSDs need Power Loss Protection (else S2D complains and it's a bad time). Other than that, they need pretty high write endurance, especially if I'm using them as cache (at least 3 DWPD or 4 TBW per day according to Microsoft, though I doubt I'll actually manage to come close to this).\n If I can get the 8 bay version of the R620 them 2 bays will be for boot (raid 1). Then depending on the setup either for hybrid: 2 bays for SSD cache and 4 for HDD capacity, or for all flash: 4 for SSD capacity, 2 for scale-up. (This drivecount is the minimum required by Microsoft).\n I've been looking at intel Ark, and the p3700/p3600/p3500 series seem ok, but they are NVMe and I feel that is a waste. Considering the backplanes can have up to SAS 2 speeds (6 gb/s), thousands of mb/s is just unusable potential.\n I also don't have too much money, so those nvme drives are a good bit pricy.\n If anyone has any recs I'll gladly take them!\n    submitted by    /u/MrMrRubic  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm relatively new to IT as I started working helpdesk two years ago, so I'm fairly certain I don't have the know-how to build something entirely from scratch which leaves me feeling stuck and not knowing how to move forward. I've done my research and looked at tutorials and it all really goes over my head. As far as I can tell, there isn't any instant gratification type of solution where you can get a VM with AD and Exchange already built in ready for you to use. There's trial versions you can download, but they eventually expire and I'm not sure how affordable it is to keep paying for it once the trial runs out. For someone in my position, what are the things I should start learning so I can get to the point where I can eventually build a lab on my own, and be able to construct my own environment that mimics a production server?

Because java doesn't work correctly, when I try to connect to it through the file it downloads to my Mac, it opens and then either crashes straight away or hangs and then crashes. And now I updated the java on my Mac and now it just gives me an error that it can't run this.\n The SSL there only supports TLS 1.0. Is it possible to update it to support at least TLS 1.2?

I surely want to run: vault warden, calibre web, pihole, filerun, jellyfin, syncthing (with a backup drive) and potentially many more services in docker containers. Besides that I was thinking about setting up proxmox to be able to experiment with different linux distros and setups.\n After watching most of the videos from ServeTheHome and doing a little research I found two models that are available from a trustworthy vendor:\n - Dell Optiplex 7060 Micro i7-8700T 6x2.4GHz 8GB\n - Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro i5-9500T 6x2.2GHz 16GB\n They both have the same price (500 in USD). I want to upgrade the RAM to 64gb anyway and get an NVMe SSD. Which one should I pick? I'm more convinced about the 7060 but I still want to hear an opinion of someone more experienced. Which processor will be better for virtualization with proxmox?\n I'm not completely decided on Optiplex either but it just seems like those machines are more solid and tested than lenovo or hp while being slightly cheaper - might be just my incorrect perception though.\n Any advice or comment is appreciated, I'm still learning how to homelab but it's so fun.

I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.\n I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.\n If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:\n *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.\n I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.\n Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.\n    submitted by    /u/grumpy-systems  \n [link]   [comments]",

There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.\n I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. \n It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.\n Questions:\n  \nWhat are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?\n How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. \n Is there any fan out there that will not show the \"Fan Failed\" message in the console?

          "description": "Hi all!\n So I'm currently planning to build (or buy) my first PC, which will be used as a server.\n I will use this server for many purposes, including : - Hosting small game servers (Minecraft) - Mysql DB - VPN & other stuff While everything will be running on Docker.\n So I've digged a bit in the subject and I like the compact size of the Mini-ITX, but I'm afraid some parts won't be upgradeable and I don't know if the cooling will be efficient enough, especially when running game servers. As for the CPU, I've seen the Ryzen 5700u, but I got no idea if it works the same way as a desktop cpu. As for the Mini-ITX, this form factor tends to be bigger in size ( but very flexible to transport). I also don't know a lot of headless cases.\n So I would like to have your advice and some build/pc recommendations. :)\n    submitted by    /u/Far-Wrongdoer8178  \n [link]   [comments]",

That's why I was start to testing all the \"not to do\" stuff. At home I've found an old Dell latitude laptop with i5 and 12 GB ram (extra I add an PWM fan with Ntc sensor for better cooling) , some caddy adapters and now I buy 2 powered USB hub. The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... \n Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. \n Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) \n Just home lab for fun\n    submitted by    /u/VictorSp1987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The new solution.\n Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5\" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.\n So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.\n Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.\n Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.\n    submitted by    /u/knightcrusader  \n [link]   [comments]",

The problem is the available/open x8 slot is directly underneath (maybe 10 cm) a GPU installed in the x16 slot (which is using a right angle PCIe adapter). Any ideas on creative ways to get a PCIe to M.2 adapter installed in that x8 slot so I can install a M.2 SSD drive (or two)??\n    submitted by    /u/seenliving  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have gigabit internet from Spectrum and the modem has a 2.5Gbe port. I would like to utilize this to get the full overprovisioned speeds. I have tried the MikroTik S+RJ10 and the 10Gtek ASF-10G-T “for Mellanox” from Amazon. Neither of which have worked so far.

My backup has plenty of space, so I want to set up regular backups of all of our desktops/laptops. I have used EaseUS ToDo backup in the past. And it worked ok. But something about it just doesn't feel right. Like it's \"Chinese software just waiting to take my data\" or something haha. That and I found that if I didn't keep an eye on it, it was complaining about being out of date, or has ads or whatever. I was debating about other options like just using Windows built in backup capabilites. Using the free version of Veeam and install the agent on each PC. Or Simply setting a batch file in a scheduled task to run robocopy to the backup share on a regular basis or at startup. This wouldn't get a system image level backup or retain history but at least files would be duplicated and easily accessible. Plenty of options out there and just wondering what everyone else does.\n    submitted by    /u/Durz0Blint123  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am not quite sure this is the correct subreddit for the question, so please redirect me if there is a better one. \n A friend of mine complained that the internet speed was too low, speed test gives 30mbs down but he's subscribed for 250. The ISP sent a technician and he disconnected the coaxial cable from the combo modem/router and connected it to a handheld testing device and said that the speed at the cable is 1000 mbs, so it is even higher than the subscription, hence the problem is with the router. \n While this maybe true that the modem/router combo has an issue, but my question is what is this device? And can it really read a speed? Or just cable quality?\n I have been trying to lookup the device that can read internet speed at the coaxial cable but can't find anything\n    submitted by    /u/Single_Description81  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I picked up a Poweredge R620 and a pair of LSI cards from ebay to upgrade my linux NAS. The first card was running the full Dell RAID firmware so I pulled down the LSI 20.00.07 firmware, flashed it, and after rebooting it sees my individual drives as expected. This card is still dropping alerts on the console that one chip is at 51C and the other chip is at 59C.\n The second card was running LSI IT firmware v13, and even though it already saw my connected drives I flashed it with the same new firmware, rebooted, and confirmed all four chips between both boards are running the new firmware. Oddly, the second board is no longer reporting the temperature, and it was running at 50C/66C so it's definitely above the threshold that should be reported. This board is also in the slot against the side of the case and is surrounded by the framework so I expected it to be running hotter anyway.\n Now this second board was also running the oldest firmware, but considering its position I don't think a firmware change could really drop the temps down below what the first card (which is more in the open and getting better airflow) is reporting.\n So I'm stumped. All four chips were flashed from the same firmware file (I also flashed the onboard PERC H710 from the same file) so I don't understand why one board would stop reporting the high temps while the other board still shows them. The test drives I plug into each controller are detected and reading just fine so I know the hardware is all working. I haven't been able to find a CLI utility that will give me the temps directly from the cards but I feel like something may have gone wrong so I want to at least be able to confirm the readings.\n So does anyone have suggestions for why this card stopped reporting the temps, and/or a utility I can grab to verify the actual temps? Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Shdwdrgn  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rules on the firewall allow that, but how do I ensure what is NOT going to my L3 VLANs get routed to pfSense? \n In other words, I want 4 of my VLANs to be L3 and everything else to be L2 with policy-based routing.

I use an app called Pin Traveller which so far has been really great and easy but from the looks of the website and app store page it doesn't seem to be regularly active and I have a big fear that the servers will shut down one day and I'll lose all my pins. How can I back up the info somehow? I don't believe the app has any interface for such a thing and I would rather die than manually put down every pin somewhere else.

          "description": "Hi! Newbie from Mexico here. I own a Synology DS413j with 3 Western Digital 6TB drives and one Seagate 3 TB using Synology Hybrid Raid. The problem is that this NAS has a very small CPU, very little RAM, so it is really S-L-O-W. Even when doing a small backup from my PC to the NAS, on a 100Mbps network (not even 1Gbps), the CPU jumps to almost 100%. Also, since it's a \"j\" (junior) version I can't run docker or anything else in it.\n So, I'm planning to replace it, and I have 2 options (of course, if you have a better one, I'm all ears).\n Option A: A new Synology Model (\"+\" plus version), with 4 or 5 bays. This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.\n Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. \n My main usage is:\n a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)\n b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)\n c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)\n d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.\n e) As my own personal \"Evernote\", with DS Note on android and windows.\n What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BarajasFernando  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks Autocorrect. \n So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.\n The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.\n Everything running on Plex.\n So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.\n Obviously I can (and have) \"optimized\"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?\n Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?\n Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.\n Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.\n Any pointers would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/slvneutrino  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm wondering what the best way to edit video metadata is. My current method works just fine but it's SOOOOO slow and I'm looking for a better method. Currently I've got a bunch of .mp4 files with data written to the Title and/or Comment fields that I want to replace. I mostly just want to put my movie title in and nothing in the comments field. The name of the file is in Plex format \"%Title% (%Year%)\". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.\n My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas?

Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.\n I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.\n I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.\n The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.\n Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!\n Whats next?

After a couple hours I figured it out:\n yt-dlp --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s \n From my understanding this will do everything you need along with populating a json file that contains info like keywords on the video, upload date etc. You can open it in Firefox. If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:\n yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sunshinesontv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nI'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?\n \nAlso, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.\n \nlastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?\n \n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/machineglow  \n [link]   [comments]",

The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. \n So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). \n Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. \n So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. \n What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time \n Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/HotEukaryoticMitosis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but here goes.\n A bit context: I have (had) an Acer Nitro Laptop, which has a 1 TB HDD, to which I added a 256 GB SSD for OS. I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.\n A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.\n The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.\n Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.\n Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. \n And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.\n PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.\n    submitted by    /u/rbn_juicepop  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello Internet. So, I managed to break my SSD today. As I was connecting it to a SATA-Cable the whole (plastic) SATA Connector just bent over. After unscrewing, I noticed that some of the connectors to the PCB of the Sata Connector were loose. In an effort to safe the thing by resoldering the pins, one broke. So I just desoldered the entire thing. Now I was wondering, is there any hope left for my drive? Could a skilled solderer just solder on a new connecter. It’s not really about the data, I just don’t want to buy a new drive :)\n Thanks for any help/advice!\n https://imgur.com/a/VXbiNwR\n    submitted by    /u/Raumschifffan  \n [link]   [comments]",

This gives me enough space to consolidate my data on lots of smaller drives into a single server and get rid of either my 2014 Unraid build or Synology DS918+. I am thinking I will keep the Unraid, but ready to be convinced otherwise.\n Unraid: 8 Drive Fractal Design Define R4 Case, Gigabyte H61MA-D3V, i3-2120, 8gb ram\n DS918+: No mods, holds 4 drives.\n I've tried a few transfers of different folders to both NAS units this evening. The Unraid seems to be about 5-10% faster. I'm more confident using the DS918+ and day-to-day that tends to be the device I use more frequently, but I figure the DS918+ is now end-of-life and the stats suggest I'm getting marginally better performance from the Unraid, not to mention future value.\n Is this a no-brainer? Or should I consider keeping the DS918+?\n My total data is only about 25tb, so the 3 x 18tb drives will be sufficient; leaving a spare bay even in the synology.\n Grateful for thoughts.

          "description": "Hello All,\n We are a movie theatre that receives *ALOT* of electronically sent films. \n These come in on a variety of different services and I've been tasked at coming up with some sort of automated solution to handle off this traffic. \n We currently have an 30TB Unraid server that's near full, but the plan was to build another server, probably TrueNas with 60TB+ as the main rig with the Unraid server doing midnight backups. Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. \n Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. \n Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. \n Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. \n Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/rlsoundca  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found it with the plastic of the cover to the left of the USB port bent out and slightly broken but not melted i think a firefighter may of stepped on it. There is a very slight smell of soot but no visual smoke damage and the hard drive it’s self seems fine. No rattling sounds either. I think it is also very possible that it may of gotten wet from the hoses but this was about 3 months ago so dry now. If i plug it in to retrieve data am i risking damaging it?

At some point I think they introduced \"lists\" and only included this and reviews on their app. I just logged on to find they removed favourites entirely, so my collection is just gone. I emailed support about it and they just said they removed it because it was redundant and not on the app... the whole situation is just dumb. And with no warning.\n So is there any possible way to see it again? It's not on WayBack and I already tried Google cache, I can see the collection on my profile but can't click/access it. I also tried it with the direct link but it didn't work. It was quite personal to me, if anyone has any suggestions it would be super appreciated.

          "description": "Hello fellow hoarders \n After buying the DS920+ from Synology last month to replace my good old 10 or 11-year-old Thecus N2200 with 2x 1 TB, the time has come to buy the drives.\n At the moment, I have inside the DS920+, 3x 2 TB units + 1 TB unit.\n My idea in buying the NAS, is to have an easy place where to put my family photos, back up from the phones to the NAS automatically (ditching google photos), use a surveillance station with 2x cameras and the extra space is for building a media library.\n I thought to buy 2 big units, shuck them, and put them inside the NAS in SHR RAID type; at the same time, put one 1 TB drive plus one 2 TB drive that came out of the NAS, inside the cases where the big drives came, connect them to RaspPIs with Rsync, one at my home other at brother-in-law, to automatically back up the family photos folder which I don't want to lose.\n ​\n After looking at disk prices .com I found the 2 best deals at Amazon DE are the 18 TB Western Digital Elements units at €16.06/TB (€289) and the second-best deal is the WD My Book 16 TB at €16.5/TB (€264). \n After reading around some older threads in the sub, I see some fellow hoarders point out the fact My Book has hardware encryption, making it not desirable to shuck and put it in the NAS. My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?\n My second question is, what drives are normally in?\n I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. \n In your opinion, is this achieveable?\n Are there any deals I should look into? \n What would you buy nowadays?\n    submitted by    /u/Oinq  \n [link]   [comments]",

The goal with those is to keep the HDDs from spinning up every time the pool is accessed (for both a power and a noise perspective). I'd like for it to automatically shuffle data around periodically based on usage (i.e. most-used data stored on the SSDs).\n Is there anything that supports this? (Ideally with a nice GUI - nothing in Linux ever seems to \"just work\" from the command-line) I've messed around with TrueNAS in the past, but it doesn't seem like it can do any of what I'm mentioning (it cannot let the HDDs go to sleep (or something along those lines), cannot shuffle data around based on usage, and you can only use SSDs as a \"cache\" where the data is offloaded to the HDDs instead of having mirrored SSDs that actually store information).\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are in the process of upgrading it to an actual Apple Server but it is a slow process due to cost. \n The problem is, they have 4 external hard drives that are used for backup purposes. Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.\n I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available.

The next four I've just picked up, and the first couple have come back with roughly 25,000 hours on them.\n Obviously any reports are going to be anecdotal and not a guarantee, but I'm curious as to if any of you have experience with used enterprise drives and reliability in that region of use.\n From my own personal experience, it seems that if a drive is destined to die it tends to die relatively quickly, and the ones I've had in the past that made it to 10,000 hours typically lasted another 50k+.\n Ultimately I spent £30 a pop on each of these, so I'm tempted to just consider it a good deal regardless and put it out of my mind.

Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.\n I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.\n The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. \n What do you guys think about this current workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/FatherOfTheSevenSeas  \n [link]   [comments]",

So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. \n I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? \n To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this, as my research consistently leaves me with as many questions as answers.\n    submitted by    /u/Hydroc777  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking at about 100-300 GB of data. I have apple, windows and linux laptops, also proxmox servers. What I don't have, is a clear-cut solution to syncing OneDrive to iCloud Drive.

It has data that is important on it that we don't want to lose so I thought it would be easiest to plug into my pc and extract a copy. It also has a copy of windows on the laptop HDD. I am just asking to make sure. I've done it before with another laptop hard drive, but I just am making sure again.\n    submitted by    /u/5-19pm  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm the family \"IT call center\" so she called and said it was time to organize things and asked if I could get everything off that she could still access from her laptop as needed, things that are on this PC are family paperwork, finances, wills, death certificate, etc.. Important stuff!!. She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.\n Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive. But is this the right way? She doesn't know where all his stuff was stored and doesn't want to miss anything I'm sure there's more than just in the \"documents\" folder. How can I ensure I get everything that may be on the rig worth saving?\n I've done some googling on backup software and sounds like I can achieve doing that. I guess I just want to be sure that it is the right approach?? And will I be able to give my sister a drive with a file dump? Is something like that achievable?\n Does backup software just grab entire OS? Or can I grab just every file? Sorry for the long winded post.

It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.\n Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.\n So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).\n So, I could use some guidance on:\n 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?\n 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?\n 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?\n 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this? Once this thing is configured,I want to be able to do remote admin from my main workstation (win10).\n Teach me Sensei! Thanks 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/teejay818  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Since this has gotten so much attention I just want to thank the guys at r/DHExchange for providing the missing issues and the guys over at https://www.retromags.com/ for providing such a great resource having most of the issues. I would also like to thank every one who uploaded different sets of these magazines on archive already. Without them putting everything together simply wouldn't be possible. I can not and will not take credit for there hard work and dedication to preservation. I just wanted to get everything together in one package for everyone to be able to have easy access to all of them. Thank you so much for all the awards and appreciation but please thank them as well. They deserve it more than I do. \n I have every single issue of nintendo power magazine all 285 issues of it uploaded to archive.org\n https://archive.org/details/nintendo-power-issue-128\n magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8a1a883270f3f094150ce258a26b4ca581839153\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d69aOgbHU_hrI--Ie5Xhf84fHOkk6lMd/view?usp=share_link\n magnent and back up of the original archive.org torrent.\n Last time a big set of these were on there nintendo took it down so I'm sure it will happen again sometime. Either way I have them all backed up on my hard drive as well and was wondering how a good way to preserve all of these would be. Reason being is because as far as I know from days of looking and researching. There is no complete set of these magazines outside of the one I just uploaded last night. I used many existing sources to get them all with the help of some awesome dudes I met in another subreddit who had 2 i was missing to complete the set. If anyone wants to help preserve these before nintendo comes a swinging it would be very much appreciated. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/Gumball1989  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really like that they (supposedly) don't open the factory seal and re-test the drives like ServerPartDeals does. If the manufacturer just recertified a drive, I don't want a seller opening it and re-testing ya know?\n Edit: I'm starting to think it's probably better to get a \"Manufacturer Recertified\" drive than a \"Factory Refurbished\". Refurbished likely means it was a repaired drive that was bad, when a Recertified should indicate a returned/open box drive. Does this logic sound right?\n Any opinions are appreciated cause I trust y'all.\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n Factory Refurbished from DiscTech:\n https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-Exos-X16-ST16000NM001G-16GB-512e-SATA-Hard-Disk-Drive\n This is what they said when I asked about them testing it:\n https://preview.redd.it/xrzy2draqzz91.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a480b31369765e87bb828bbae3de62a8db9c00\n Manufacturer Recertified from ServerPartDeals:\n https://serverpartdeals.com/products/seagate-exos-x16-st16000nm001g-16tb-7-2k-rpm-sata-6gb-s-512e-4kn-256mb-3-5-fastformat-manufacturer-recertified-hdd\n Update: DO NOT buy from DiscTech's eBay store if you want their 1 year seller warranty.

I was able to get a cheap Optiplex which seems to fit quite well for my use case. Problem I have now is, that I read, that the HBA cards are getting quite hot and in that Optiplex SFF won’t be to much space to provide proper cooling. At the beginning I was thinking of a new case (Nanoxia deep silence rev 6b to fit everything in one case), but with that Optiplex a case swap seems to be quite hard. Building the whole thing new from scratch would cost way more then use that Optiplex. Now I thought of getting a random tower put that HDDs in there connect them to a power supply and then link them to an LSI HBA 9200-16e which I would then plug into the Optiplex. Is the card going to be to hit then? Should I just leave the case of the Optiplex open and this will do the job? Or will it be better to just plug in USB Drives into the Optiplex?\n If building an external enclosure all I really need is that HBA card (it mode), a case, a usual power supply and the SAS to SATA cables, right? \n Any other solution or ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/locopivo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "SSDs are typically not seen as a good choice for cold storage because unpowered drives gradually lose their data. Consumer drives seem to be spec'ed for 1 year anyway and that spec is based on a pretty heavily used drive.\n How would you \"refresh the charge\" on a cold stored drive though? Is it as simple as plugging it into a power source (for how long?) or does the data actually need to be re-written? Does this require an OS to perform the task or does the drive firmware just handle it when it happens to have power?\n With a lot of drives going to SMR and SSDs going down in price I can sort of see a lot of backup tasks (certainly not all) migrating over to SSDs soon. It isn't clear to me how to work around their limitations in this space.\n    submitted by    /u/Such-Evidence-4745  \n [link]   [comments]",

But asking around, experienced friends mentioned two things, 1) LSI card IT mode is a thing, therefore SATA port count does not matter too much, 2) apparently supermicro and decommissioned server boards exist (average pulled-not-refurbed offerings were on the higher end of my budget; not going to get any of the beefy ones).\n I start to hesitate whether to get an average desktop board and grab a LSI, or find a previously owned sm board. Searching in the subreddit, it seems both have been done, but I didn't see opinions of choosing between the two, although points have been made about whether it's good to get second hand motherboards. \n I am comfortable with using HPC servers and have done some VPS self hosting for fun, but this is my first time to build and maintain a physical server.

          "description": "Hi, I'm currently in the process of switching my home server from a Raspberry Pi 4 to a 2012 Mac Mini, and am not sure how to go about it. My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. \n As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini. I know that mac has limited ext4 support, but I'd prefer to run the drives in a mac-native (still cross-platform) file system. \n So my questions are:\n  \nWhat filesystem would work best in this case? I have heard good things about exfat, and it seems like a good cross-platform option. I am also open to APFS.\n How best can I go about migrating my data onto the new filesystem? Is there a tool that can do this?\n As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_CINN4M0N_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought that there might be sth minor, but when I got home I checked again and it really died.\n I check the warranty and it expired on October, 22nd.\n That's my 2nd WD Red which failed shortly after the warranty expired. The first one was 3TB WD RED.\n So, I'm thinking to switch into Seagate Ironwolf. Thoughts? Maybe 6TB.\n EDIT:\n I have a Synology DS218+. 2x 4TB WD RED drives were bought in late summer 2019.\n I uploaded some images.

          "description": "I have a large refurbished Dell server 3.5 inch hard drive, but a problem finding USB enclosures for it. Some of my docks don't seem to have enough power to run it, as the drive randomly shuts down (this is especially apparent in my hot swap dock, where with the enterprise drive running, if I try to plug in a drive in the other slot, the entire device turns off and restarts as the new drive tries to spin up). I know it's a problem with the enclosure because the drive works fine as an internal drive running off a normal computer SATA power cable. Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.\n Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures?

          "description": "The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. \n Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).\n So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBirdOfFire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyLegend1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).\n Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.\n Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5\" bays and is less than 19\" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.\n ​\n Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?\n This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082\n This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/\n This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179\n    submitted by    /u/icelandismine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.\n This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.\n I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow.

Specifically I am thinking about our pics, which are incredibly disorganized, duplicated, etc. Would like to be able to open up the iPad and go through the NAS and be like \"that one sucks, DELETE... that one is upside down, FIX.... Create a \"wedding pictures\" folder and move all these pics over there.... etc*\"\n Is all that possible?\n \\One thing that I am not clear on... let's say I go to a folder full of pics on the NAS and start editing them on an iPAD (or whatever device, PC, MAC, etc). Am I using whatever photo viewing / editing SW to view and edit the file residing on the NAS (i.e. the SW is acting like a \"window\" to look at the file still residing on another computer).... or am I pulling the file ONTO the device, making changes, and then when I hit \"save\" it overwrites (uploads) the new file to the NAS?*\n I am not sure there is a fundamental difference in outcome but just wondering.\n    submitted by    /u/_How_Can_She_Slap_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My question is essentially the title and mostly comes from idle curiosity. Do they not make 2.5\" CMR drives anymore? I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.\n The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.\n TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.\n Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...\n    submitted by    /u/KRS_88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Say I have a 4 tb NAS drive that I want to make an offline backup of. I have four 1TB drives and only one dock so only one drive can be attached to the system at a time. Is there an elegant way to start copying files to the 4tb drive to the first 1tb drive until it runs out of space, then wait till I swap it with an empty drive, and then keep copying, keeping track of all the drives needed to do this in order? I don't want the drives in RAID, because that would require plugging all of them in at once, and I also don't want one drive failing taking the data stored on all the other drives with it.\n Isn't this how tape drives work for storing huge drive arrays? It should be pretty standard archival practice right?\n Ideally, I don't want to have to fully reassemble the data to find something. I want to be able to plug in a drive, search around for what it contains out of the larger drive, and copy individual files back without doing a full restore. Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. \n Is there a solution that can do all this? I use Linux if that makes a difference on works and what doesn't.\n    submitted by    /u/AgreeableLandscape3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a \"problem\" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.\n The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.\n One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on \"disk1\" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.\n To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.\n Some info about my system:\n  \nOS: Arch Linux\n Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1\n Asus Prime H510M-K\n Intel i3-10100\n 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)\n Disks directly connected to the motherboard\n  \nI experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.\n I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.\n I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.\n    submitted by    /u/bepsifif  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.\n The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...\n Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression?

          "description": "Just showing off but I thought this might be useful to people who own several hundred GB of comics. I use it to repack high quality manga on my Kobo, it more than doubled the amount I can store at once.\n I know such repacking software already exists because people post on manga sites all the time, but I couldn't find any scripts online, much less ones that were easy to use. This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.\n Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.\n The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.\n This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.\n https://github.com/avalonv/reCBZ\n    submitted by    /u/reallyfuckingay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. \n I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault\n It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.\n So my best thought is that ideally \"everyone\" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.\n Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the \"library of alexandria\" idea.\n Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.\n Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group!

          "description": "I got a rack-mount chassis + motherboard with 12 3.5 hard drive slots. I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. \n I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. \n I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB. That being said, I can deal with smaller capacity for now and get one of those 60 drive behemoths a couple years later. I would rather get something decent to start though.\n    submitted by    /u/Term_Grecos  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.\n  \nBut what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?\n From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? \n If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? \n And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk?

          "description": "Can I get a little help with mergerfs? I'm struggling with the permissions. My current setup is two disks pooled as /mnt/storage. The storage directory has \"nouser\" and \"nogroup\", for owner and group. When I add directories to \"storage\" they are created with my local user and group. This is causing me a problem accessing them as a docker volume (I'm using the uid and gid of the local user). I can't even delete the directories created in \"storage\" as sudo. I can, however delete them from the \"disk1\" or \"disk2\". Can someone point in the right direction, please? Is there something special I need to do in the docker-compose file? Then end goal is to store media files and manage them with sonarr and radarr as containers, and docker permission denied error is a real road block.\n    submitted by    /u/smith_randallscott  \n [link]   [comments]",

The rest is either only on A or on B.\n ​\n Both A and B have new added and removed data.\n I want to merge them to keep only one going forward.\n ​\n I tried to resolve the issue manually and with the help of https://freefilesync.org/\n but i get more mess than before\n ​\n i thought about my issue and think i could tackle it in a two step way:\n ​\n  \n​\n  \nfirst remove on Drive B every file that exists on Drive A at the same location and is identical\n wich leaves me with a delta of only Files Existing on Drive B that are either changed, added or removed from Drive A\n ​\n 2)\n the second step would be to check which files that are left on Drive B do already exists on Drive A in any location and are identical (so i can catch files that were moved on Drive A to a new location) and delete them from Drive B\n Result:\n Which would leave me with just new and unique files on Drive B with a much smaller subset wich i could tackle manually and sort where need be\n ​\n does any of you have any Input or faced a similar problem? do you know of any tools that can do either step one or two.

I am just looking for some guidance and knowledge.\n I plan on renting out some storage to some friends and friends of friends (at first). What are the potential pitfalls doing so? I am thinking for example, what if someone uploads a copyrighted movie and uses my platform to share it. (I think this is the most likely scenario to happen, but you guys can maybe think of more) \n What am I to do, to prevent malicious use and what am I responsible for? What kind of legal charges could be made against me if a user uses my service like this.\n I own a registered business and would make individual contracts with each user including sending out invoices etc. So I know every user by name, adress and bank details at least. I think that should prevent the most evil kind of malicious use but I am still worried about some of the lesser ones. \n Every thought about this topic is appreciated. \n Cheers and happy hoarding\n    submitted by    /u/Sinath_973  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had a home file-server around for years, but only a few months ago started using monitoring/alarms on it. I've noticed that every day my HDDs record a peak temp of 65C around 7am. I looked at the manual for these Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 HDDs, which states that they shouldn't exceed 60*C for prolonged use. My HDD temp regularly exceeds 60C between 2am-3pm (!)\n My questions are: * Is this a reasonable operating temperature? Am I worrying over nothing?\n  \nI already have two fans blowing over these hard drives, is there anything else I can do to keep the temperatures down (preferably not liquid cooling)\n \nThis temp spike seems totally unrelated to system activity. No spikes reads/writes, network calls, spikes in number of processes or cpu. I can't think of any other signals of \"this server is working hard\". I'm usually asleep when this happens, I'm totally baffled why this temp spike is happening. Can anyone think of any other reason the HDD temp would spike?\n \n Thank you for the help friends\n    submitted by    /u/kaivaii  \n [link]   [comments]",

A friend of mine is really commited using DVDFab. This brings me to my first question:\n Do both create a lossless backup of the Blu Ray or does one create a better output (wheter it being the folder structure or a packed iso)?\n Also, while I constantly check the revision history of MakeMKV, is it possible that future updates create better outputs or are the current ones already completely lossless? And if so, is there a way to compare the disk with the created backup to check if there has been an bugs which created a quality loss (for example by not copying some files)\n A little exkurs - do DVDFab, AnyDVD and MakeMKV differ in the creation of the output (video files like mkv) talking about quality or are they same?\n    submitted by    /u/d3crypti0n  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a few directories that I need to keep data synced to share amongst a few windows machines. Drive did this pretty well. \n I’ve looked around a bit, and the options seem slim in comparison to the same experience I had with drive. Here’s some of the things I’ve considered:\n  \n rclone, currently top of the list. Doesn’t quite capture my requirements, but could mash something up scheduler to sync a few times a day or something \n  Freefilesync, bravo for open source but looks clunky\n  Syncthing, love the concept, but hate the idea of having to run a client on the NAS. I also don’t need the data encrypted in transit\n  Bypass all this nonsense and just store my data directly on the share. The only problem with this approach is there are times when I am mobile with no connectivity and still need a locally cached copy to work from to sync back later. \n  \nI’ve seen a few paid for options as well which I am not opposed to, but wanted to get an idea from folks that may have followed a similar path as myself.\n    submitted by    /u/digilink  \n [link]   [comments]",

Occasionally I use the NAS to stream some videos to my TV. I don’t use the NAS for anything other than that. Since buying a new camera, my storage capacity is filling up very quickly. \n It’s very important to me that I don’t lose these files so I have the drives set in RAID1. (I’ve been reading up on this subreddit and I am also going to make an extra copy on an external hard drive to store at another location.)\n Using a NAS for this has really been working great for me since I don’t need to worry about backing up or anything, I am always sure that my files are stored on 2 drives. \n What should I do? These are the options as I see them:\n Option 1 is to buy new drives with bigger capacity and use these to replace the drives I already have. \n Option 2 is to buy a NAS with 4 bays. Keep my 2 existing drives and buy 2 new drives to expand the volume. \n Are these options any good? Maybe you guys have different suggestions?

So much for being \"certified\".\n DOA should not be a problem right?\n Most companies will take care of customers when it's their issue, so I call up WD, and they say:\n  \nThere can only be one Advanced RMA outstanding\n They will setup a standard RMA for the DOA replacement\n They want me to ship the DOA replacement and then WD will send the replacement - so much for \"Advanced RMA\".\n  \nI paid $25 for Advanced RMA, and I got nothing out of it except a DOA drive - now I have to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement drive. Amazing they're so inflexible with their RMA system, I guess that's what happens when all the staff is outsourced overases.\n I'm surprised at the bias towards WD, especially with how poor their RMA process is. This alone is going to put me off buying WD drives for my NAS even if Seagate supposedly has a higher failure rate (which they may, but replacements are easy to come by!).\n Anyone else facing troubles with WD RMAs?\n I have about 50 - 60 drives in my various NAS devices, and this is the second time in a row that I've had issues with WD RMAs, during 2020, it took several months to get my RMA back, and the lack of communication and inflexiblity of their RMA department doesn't seem to be addressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Onion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see a lot of talk about using sata power splitters, but couldn’t I just buy a couple extra Sata power cables from Corsair? \n Is there anything I’m missing here? How many drives can I power on the HX850? 5v @ 25amp on this psu.\n I’m probably gonna have this PSU powering only Sata drives in a DAS box. Might have to save a sata/peripheral port for the HBA expander. Is that gonna be a problem electric wise since I’m not powering any 12v components? And how does the switch for single or multiple 12v rails work for my use case? \n Any tips would be appreciated thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Sale7548  \n [link]   [comments]",

Veracrypt, Boxcrypt solves this problem by adopting a volume based approach but it's not suitable for cloud storage.\n Some tools I've used:\n  \nRclone - By far the most stable but sadly it neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening. By using the crypt remote, the files sizes do change, but it's a static transformer which can be easily deciphered to get plaintext size. By using chunker along with crypt, file sizes could be hidden to some extent, but not completely.\n Cryptomator - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Securefs - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Gocryptfs - Neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening.\n CryFS - Supports both file size obfuscation and directory flattening !! In theory this should be a good fit, but sadly it suffers from terrible performance issues due to the fact that it chunks files into fixed size small blocks (4kb - 32kb). The block size can be configured but it poses some other issues.\n  \nI've tried all sorts of combinations but it's either unstable or hacky. Looking for any leads here.

Currently, this is chaos since sometimes another student is already at the computer their project is saved onto. \n I've narrowed it down, but still a bit lost on the specifics:\n 1) Symlink / Network drive - What drive is worth it, what is overkill? 1TB would be enough for all purposes now, but a 2TB would be ok too. Speed is important(project load times should be as minimally affected as possible), but a bit tough to gauge what is needed.

Usually saved because it is in the deleted folder but there have been pictures that have been completely wiped. \n So to tackles this, I was thinking of setting up a NAS Drive but I don't know how much space would be apt. I myself have 110GB worth of pictures. My family members to have more. It's likely to be a home server? I am not sure. \n I wondered if I could give each family member 1TB of space. But only they can access it with their own password. Nobody can access any drive except their own. Which means if they forget their password to access the drive then... oops, oh well (I am done helping them when they forget their password).\n What would be the best way to get something like this set up?\n EDIT: I suppose I could back up everything to the cloud but many family members don't want me to see their pictures.

          "description": "So a few months ago I finally got enough drives to fill up my server (Dell T630) and have a sizable amount of storage (3x 6 drive Z2's of 8TB SAS drives, 32TB RAW x 3). I'm currently using a Ubuntu 22.04.x VM with ZoL with the PERC H730 passed through.\n To get a single share I'm currently using mergerFS to combine my pools + gdrive. Biggest issue is that mergerFS as far as I've seen just prioritizes the first \"drive\", fills that up and them moves to the next drive without any kind of distribution. That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.\n The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now. Is glusterfs a good option to get that single point of storage and share or are there better options now?\n Current setup\n    submitted by    /u/_-Smoke-_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.\n Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.\n Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).\n Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.\n I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.\n Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?\n    submitted by    /u/GuruDev1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't mind getting a slower spinny HDD over an SDD (as I won't edit off of these).\n I'm not looking for some massive RAID setup or a backup server. Only an external drive (and possibly a second one for redundancy). I do know how to work with computer hardware and whatnot, so putting an internal drive in some sort of housing, if that's cheaper, is no problem for me.\n    submitted by    /u/def-pri-pub  \n [link]   [comments]",

The max amount i found where some lsi cards with 24 ports and they where quite expensive.\n I also read about expanders but how negative is the effect on the performance?\n From what i understand you could for example split a single 6g connection to two 3g ones, which should still be fine for hdds, right?\n Would it work to get one of the 24 ports with an expander and then use (theoretically) 48 disks at 3g each, without a performance hit when all disks are written to at the same time?\n Thx :)\n    submitted by    /u/Pommes254  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've noticed though that archive.org seems to be having trouble keeping IPA files available for download, or at least I assume so.\n For example, one of my favorite iOS games, Gesundheit! by Matt Hammill, has been delisted for a few years now. I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).\n Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/J0mSp00ns  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figured if there was anywhere that could help me with large storage servers, it'd be r/datahoarders\n I recently had a bad electrical experience which knocked out my storage server. ( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. \n My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array. (none of the drives in question were from the original failure) I am at a complete loss at what kind of formatting and partitioning these drives were set up with. The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.\n First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.\n  \nMacroit says they're each just one large logical partition\n AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions\n Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.\n  \nWhen I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.\n I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.\n I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.\n    submitted by    /u/ArcTechNerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

I bought one new and another one used from Amazon Warehouse, especially trying to avoid them being manufactured on the same batch.\n However, both were manufactured the same day in 2021.

Should I return one and try to buy another one at a different online store, or is this no longer a risk?\n I have searched a lot and there seems to be some correlation, but usually USENIX and other papers I've read on the matter usually talk about huge disk arrays... how about a simple 2-bay RAID-1 setup?

          "description": "I have a pretty large physical movie collection (mixture of blu-rays and 4k UHD blu-rays). 99% of the time I'm watching these movies at my PC on my 21:9 ultrawide monitor, so I started ripping the files off the disk and put them on an external drive.\n The problem is I have a mini-ITX PC that is already packed to the brim and can't fit any extra drives beyond the couple m.2 slots on the motherboard. I also don't have a lot of desk space to store a large desktop HDD, NAS, etc., etc. I decided on a 5TB portable USB-powered external, because at least at the time (and I think still now) that was the largest size I could get in that form factor). \n When 4k blu-ray files are upwards of 60gb and regular blu's are like 30gb, a 5TB would fill up relatively quickly. So I started encoding the files using handbrake (for a number of reasons, but one being I could knock those file sizes down by at least half, if not more). \n I'm using Nvidia NVenc to encode my files because it's a lot faster using the GPU vs CPU, but I've only just recently realized that the quality suffers. Tbh, it's not the worst thing in the world I've ever seen, but when I compare it to the original ripped movie file I can see the difference and now I can't live with it. \n So, now I'm thinking I'm not going to encode at all and just gonna store the original movie files as is. I guess this means I'm gonna need a lot more than 5TB, though, but my problem still stands that I just don't have a lot of desk space for larger external drives. \n The other issue is that anything more than those 2.5\" portable drives usually require their own power brick and it will be nearly impossible for me to access an outlet at this point around my desk. \n Do I have any options? Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions based on my restrictions?\n    submitted by    /u/clothing_throwaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Backstory\n I live in Europe and back in 2018 a friend of mine was in the US and picked up a few Easystore 8TBs for me. I shucked them all and put them in my Synology NAS. All worked bar one which could not be detected. I connected it back to my PC first using a WD Elements adapter/case (the Euro version of the Easystore) and the drive was not even detected. Then I used the Easystore \"adapter\" and it powered up but it was detected as a 2TB drive and I could do nothing with it. Windows Disk Manager said it needed to be initialized but threw an error when I tried. WD Utilities said the SMART test failed and that I had apparently entered a password wrong 5 times. The only option was to Erase but then it threw an exception with no details when I tried that. It was a legit disk too, not one that someone had swaped out and sent back to the store. Since I was not in the US and I had shucked it I assumed I would get no help from WD and put it in a box and forgot about it.\n So now in 2022 its out of warranty and I am curious if there is anything I can do to revive it? Amazingly I still had the adapter from the Easystore case attached to it. I plugged it in again today and it was the same as before. I dont hear any funny sounds either. It spins up when I connect it to the computer, shows up in Disk Manager, still as 2TB but I still cant do anything with it.\n One thing I am not sure about is whether the Easystore adapter I am using is the one that came with the 8TB drive. I had a batch of Easystore 3TB drives previously and it may be from those so maybe that is having trouble with the 8TB drive. The product id is 25fb firmware revision 3004 according to WD Utilities\n    submitted by    /u/brimur  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm bringing online a 12GBPS SAS Jbod with 90 18tb drives on it and am stuck trying to decided between a couple deployment scenarios. \n I can deploy with a 1950x (16 core threadripper) or a more modern 5950x (16 core ryzen) both with 128gb of ram. I was leaning to the thread ripper as i'm not entirely sure i'm going to run anything on the host much beyond the OS and the 5950x has a better resell value should I decide to sell it. Any real reason to go 5950x over the thread ripper? Power consumption isn't really an issue. \n I've got a bunch of systems in play already here (with about 1/4 of 2pb used across a few Supermicro builds / jbods) that i'm going to consolidate here. I'm thinking once I get the data over (I have serious data backed up in two off site locations) i'm going to rebuild the other systems into a ceph cluster. For now, i'm debating truenas or proxmox with zfs pools. I'm thinking 10 of 9 drives with one hotspare per, but i'm open to other suggestions. \n Feel free to tell me where I'm probably making the wrong decisions.\n    submitted by    /u/SwallowedBuckyBalls  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the new drives, for lack of any motivation one way or another, I’ve setup as RAID0. My motherboard handles the RAID and so now I’ve got a single 24TB volume in Windows. I’m using Win7 Pro still but that’s fine. The usage for this drive will be a lot of virtual machines, as well as a junk drive for downloading and parsing through gobs of data to save what I want and trash the rest.

After all, the breakout cables are using RCA connectors, which S-Video was deliberately designed to circumvent. I'm just a bit skeptical and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether or not that would be an issue, and of course I am also open to other capture card recommendations! \n Thanks!
