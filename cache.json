When you create a booking page on Cal.com, other people can use the page to make an appointment with you, and a new event will be added to a CalDAV calendar you specify. In fact, Cal.com can integrate with multiple calendars to help you let people book appointments while avoiding conflicts. Handy!\n However, there are some calendars I would like Cal.com to use for conflict avoidance that are published as .ics URLs only. And right now Cal.com can't subscribe to .ics feeds.\n My first attempt was to use my Nextcloud instance to subscribe to the .ics feed, then have Cal.com access my Nextcloud calendars via CalDAV. Unfortunately, Cal.com can only see CalDAV calendars that live directly in my Nextcloud instead of the .ics feed it subscribes to.\n Is there another intermediary CalDAV server that can subscribe to .ics feeds and exposes them as a read-only CalDAV calendars so that Cal.com can see them? Of course, the CalDAV server needs to refresh the .ics subscriptions frequently to reflect the latest updates.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/avamk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Due to life reasons I will only have mobile internet for about a year going forward.\n I just realized that this comes with a bunch of unforeseen issues. My mobile internet provider blocks all incoming connections before it even reaches my router, so I'm unable to port forward or connect to my server from the outside.\n For the past day I've been looking into solutions for this. My plan is to pay for a cheap VPS, and have my home server establish a tunnel to this, and let the VPS forward all traffic through the tunnel to my home server.\n At first, it seemed like a reverse SSH tunnel was what I was looking for. But reading up on it, SSH tunnels only seem to support TCP. While I found some workarounds this seems to complicate things unnecessarily.\n After some more research I found rathole which seems to do exactly what I need.\n Does anyone have any experience with this?\n Ideally I would like to use rathole to forward traffic from the VPS to my home server in order to establish a VPN connection through wireguard.\n This seems to be the right tool for the job. Is there anything I'm missing here?\n Also, does anyone know of a good cheap VPS that's suitable for this?\n    submitted by    /u/3_Thumbs_Up  \n [link]   [comments]",

This year I have no academic purpose anymore, I'm just doing it to satisfy my own, and hopefully your curiosity.\n The survey can be found here. I have updated the survey a bit compared to last years; I have accounted better for the possibility of virtualisation and asked more detailed hardware questions. The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers.

I was wondering if there's a document system that works similar to how PhotoPrism works: point it at a directory and let it chew over everything there, writing tags and other information to its own database while leaving the original files untouched.\n ​\n Thanks in advance for any wisdom shared.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatAGoodDoggy  \n [link]   [comments]",

You only have to login to authentik once, and then just grant the applications access when you login to them. \n LDAP should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't have 2fa and is quite an old protocol, so I suggest using it only when an app doesn't support other options. \n Proxy auth also displays the login portal, but it works on the reverse proxy level, so reverse proxy forwards requests to authentik, which makes sure the user is authenticated. Authentik then forwards the requests to the app, with a special header with the username. This option is best for static/single page/single-user apps, but not ideal for most of them as it will break mobile apps and some APIs due to it's low level nature. Some apps have explicit support for proxy auth and work just as well with it as some do with OpenID. \n Authentik docs have per-app instructions which show the recommended way to set it up.\n    submitted by    /u/dada513  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used Nginx Proxy Manager for a while now as a reverse proxy and to manage my SSL certificates, for items like my own static site and Jellyfin, and I never have much trouble getting it to work. I've decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I'm having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.\n Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver's docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:\n version: \"3\" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 \n I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let's Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:\n Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server's IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes \n When creating a new SSL certificate:\n - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains \n All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed\n The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I've set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I'm unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I'm completely out of ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/Sigma-Alpha_2  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I posted this over to /r/linux4noobs but wanted to see what you guys thought of this.\n I have been using a Synology NAS for a while now. In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.\n I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.\n I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.\n So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?\n I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.\n Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?\n The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don't have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI's or something like that.\n    submitted by    /u/SmoothLiquidation  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did this about a year ago, and it was great.\n I just moved this webserver to something more stable and when generating the SSL certificate I expected having to revoke the old one or something of the sort (maybe having to copy the old ones to the new server). But nope, let's encrypt just let me request a certificate with no issues. Is this normal?\n What is preventing someone else from creating a certificate for my website?\n I am perhaps misunderstanding the goal of the certificates.\n Any pointers or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/dmarchu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't remember where I found the guides that helped me set it up in the first place.\n So I started keeping notes about anything that I set up in a Google document. This has already saved my bacon several times but the document is getting a bit unorganized. I'm wondering if a Wiki may be better suited to keep all of this organized? Here are a few things I'd be looking for:\n ​\n  \nSome sort of first page \"Table of Contents\" feature that shows all of the topics and subtopics. Since this is rather focused I don't want to use search functions to find my entries.\n Very strong formatting options (especially headers, styling, and tables)\n Good screenshot/image support (including being able to see the original size)\n Easy to use on desktop and mobile.\n I will mostly use this just myself. However, it would be a bonus if I could give access to certain sections of my wiki to other users. I rent out my home when I'm traveling and would love to give access to certain sections to my manager so he can fix things while I'm away.\n  \n​\n In general do you guys think a Wiki engine would be good for something like this?

I just want it to be able to handle any file formats I throw at it, so sometimes transcoding might be necessary based on the device its streaming to. \n If its smaller, quiet, and uses less power, that would be great.

I just want something thats on when I need it. Wireless picture storage from Apple devices is also what I’d like it to be able to do. I have 1gb up/down fiber internet.

The only difference is that what should be public is on public dns (cloudflare) and what should not be accessible from internet, is on my lan dns (Adguard in my case). And traefik having dns challenge wildcard certs for my domain. \n But what happens when someone finds out my public IP, and adds to their host file my ip and my(or try random) \"private\" dns record. Will it request from traefik my supposedly private url/page but from public internet? Since traefik servers those subdomains and it doesn't care where request came from? I have even seen you can request a specific IP while requesting dns name with curl too. \n So from security point of view, is it possible to access your apparently \"private\" dns records using this method ? \n If yes, what is the best practice to separate public/private records under same public domain ? Use two traefik instances, or I have been looking for source IP restrictions for those private/lan requests ?\n  \n​\n Unfortunately haven't got much responses at r/Traefik, let's see what you think :)\n    submitted by    /u/Koto137  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Long story short, my mom recently switched ISPs and because of that, Hulu thinks she’s in a different zip code, when she’s literally a block away from me. I’ve spent hours on the phone and live chat but either everyone is too stupid to understand the situation or Hulu doesn’t possess the ability to allow live for two different geographic cable markets. \n So either me and the rest of our family (10+ people) don’t get to access live local networks or she doesn’t, because Hulu asks her if she wants to change her home location for the Hulu account. If she does, it changes the market for the account and the account then thinks everyone else is in the wrong location. \n So what I want to do is setup a proxy or VPN on my network and point her firestick to it from her network. \n Obviously my main concern is security. I’m not a big fan of opening an external port just so my mom can watch local news but.. she’s my mom so..I gotta. \n Any simple and safe solutions?\n    submitted by    /u/ipooaftercoffee  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a friend whose college network blocks certain connections, such as SSH or anything custom that uses SSL. I know enough to know that if I re-host the same service at the same port with no SSL, it works. This makes no sense to me, but does make me feel pretty uneasy since one of the things we use is a self-hosted voice/text chat server.\n I've been getting into self-hosting a bit and have looked at stuff like Pivpn for myself. But before I go experimenting and taking up this person's college time, I'm wondering if anyone has ideas for things that would be most likely to defeat this. I know that given the original problem, it's possible that some or all VPN protocols might not work. I haven't tried simply hosting the service on port 443, so I don't know if they're doing something special to monitor traffic. We did find that a particular text-based rmote access protocol is functioning fine, but various other secure connections are blocked. All of the above are using TCP and SSL. I have no idea what the firewall is doing here, but I'm unhappy that it's forcing us to send things back and forth in the clear, so if I can fix it, I'd like to do so.\n    submitted by    /u/EinsteinVonBrainless  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to create a VPN to connect my two remote devices (say A - Server, B - Client). Explored Tailscale and other services, but I wanted a server with the control over keys and config. This article helped me to setup a hub-spoke VPN with the hub on a VPS. But it had few concerns regarding security. Let's say my VPS provider or an intruder, say X, manages to gain access to the server. Possible impact :\n  \nX can impersonate as a peer. All he has to do is switch Endpoint A's public key with his key and restart wg and he'll start receiving packets from an unsuspected client B.\n X can view the unencrypted packets as the hub has to decrypt and re-encrypt before forwarding packets between the spokes.\n  \nI was searching for some way in which these can be solved and I saw this article from the same person. To sum it up, there are two layers of tunnels, one hub-spoke as explained above, and another inner layer just between the two spokes through the outer layer. This kind of makes it a virtual point-point topology setup for the inner layer which adds its own layer of encryption. So with firewall properly setup in the peers, now if X manages to gain access:\n  \nX can impersonate as a peer in the outer layer, but his packets will not reach my peer's inner layer as the private & public keys of inner layer is never known to the hub(VPS). So effectively the incoming connection is rejected by wireguard (on wg port) and firewall (on other ports).\n X can view unencrypted packets coming from outer layer. But there is one more layer of encryption in the inner layer which makes it effectively E2E.\n  \nI believe setting up a hub-spoke this way will be safe and private on any VPS as long as the wireguard cryptography isn't broken.

Being mobile friendly is important, auto sync with mobile devices as pictures are taken (or maybe on next wifi connection) is a strong desire.

Thank you mods and contributors, this list is beautiful.\n https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#photo-and-video-galleries \n PhotoPrism looks appealing (especially since I have a spare Coral laying around). I really like how LibrePhotos looks, Immich, ImageStore, HomeGallery, and Damselfly all look good too. Unfortunately lots of these either don't have a mobile app or require sideloading. That's fine for me, but maybe not for user #2, and definitely not for any additional users someday.

I don't mind the monthly fee to support the project, but the fact that they absolutely mandate Ubuntu is a deal breaker. I moved all my self-hosted stuff to Debian due to Canonical's advertising.

          "description": "Hello.\n I've been working on something I would like to share with you. It's called Assetgrid and it's a personal finance management tool.\n Github repo: https://github.com/assetgrid/assetgridapp\n Website: https://assetgrid.app\n Screenshots: https://assetgrid.app/screenshots\n What can Assetgrid do at the moment?\n At the moment Assetgrid is a bit basic, but still useful, which is why I'm sharing it. It has a powerful CSV importer, simple transaction categorization and it can display your spending in categories and your cash flow and balance over time.\n It also has a powerful query engine and allows bulk editing, so you can quickly categorize your transactions based on simple criteria. If you want a quick overview of your personal finances, give it a try.\n In the future I have bigger plans.\n The vision / long term aims for the project\n I created Assetgrid because I felt that most self-hosted personal finance tools were very tuned for a single task. Most commonly budgets. That allows for very easy to use and intuitive software, but I just personally needed something more. I'd have one tool to keep track of receipts, another for budgets, a third for loans and investments and I'd be entering the same information into each tool. I think it just makes sense to collect it all in one place.\n In the near future I will add automation, so you can automatically process imported transactions. I will also add a metadata that allows you to attach any kind of information like file attachments, relations and notes to your data. Once I'm satisfied with the import/processing aspect I will begin working on budgets, bills, currencies and non-cash assets. I have spent a lot of time considering how the various features should play together and I have some ideas for how to integrate the features in an efficient workflow that doesn't get in your way and only presents you to the subset of features you use.\n    submitted by    /u/Floedekartofler  \n [link]   [comments]",

Why?\n Here is the \"Applications\" network: https://i.imgur.com/HHFNYrb.png\n Here you can see both applications: https://i.imgur.com/QrdFejh.png\n And here is my the proxy host I'm trying to set up: https://i.imgur.com/BiDHxaE.png\n You can see I put the local IP of the VM, which I can reach just fine. Typing https://192.168.30.66:9443 gets me to Portainer no problem. The domain itself just points to 192.168.30.66. I tried changing the IP in Nginx Proxy Manager to just \"portainer\", maybe it's set up as a hostname. No dice. I also tried using the internal IP of the docker network.

Phenomenally, at the other end of things, we have the latest cards from AMD and Nvidia that can do fast transcoding but they are all 100W+ behemoths. In fact, a quick survey leads me to believe that all of the <75w GPUs available today are 5+ years old which means they have old encode/decode technology. \n My assumption is that the market for low power transcoding has gone to Intel quicksync. \n I've recently been setting up a Dell PowerEdge to handle a number of different functions including, I had hoped, some occasional on-the-fly transcoding. Then I had to slap my forehead when I realized that the Dell server firmware doesn't support any igpu functionality - so no Intel QS for this machine. I would have to add a separate video card if I want hardware encoding. But there aren't any attractive options that I can find.\n    submitted by    /u/chmedly020  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "OK - I'm a bit all over the place, but I'm wondering if anyone can point me to a good guide that will help me link a domain I purchased to my webserver?\n I bought a domain from Google Domains, then discovered CloudFlare is perhaps a bit more secure/healthy, so I've been trying to migrate it over there. At the same time, I'm trying to link it to the specific device on my network that hosts the webpage I want to display at that domain. \n What I can currently do\n  \nHave a simple page locally hosted on OpenWRT (I can go on my network to 192.168.X.X:port and see my webpage come up)\n Have a port correctly forwarded (I can go from the internet to X.X.X.X:port [my public IP] and see my webpage come up)\n Log into Google Domains and see that I own a domain\n Log into CloudFlare Dashboard and see that my website is \"active\", that I'm using the right nameservers etc\n  \nWhat I cannot do\n  \nLink my domain to my X.X.X.X:port\n Get Dynamic DNS properly running on OpenWRT - this is a separate problem, I've followed a guide and it should be working, not sure why it's not but for now the DNS type A record on CloudFlare is accurate, because I manually entered it, so one thing at a time\n  \nAnyway, I can't be the first person who bought a domain and is now trying to self-host a simple web page - but I can't seem to find a good step-by-step guide online anywhere. Does anyone know of one? Or better yet, does anyone feel like jumping on a voice call with me on discord and walking me through something I might be doing wrong?\n Also - is the right thing to forward a random port? Or should I be using 80/443 somehow and have an internal proxy? Or is Cloudflare enough?\n Thanks everyone\n    submitted by    /u/Powerful_Reflection  \n [link]   [comments]",

You chose any domain you wanted and it was registered to <yourdomain>.asuscomm.com. I used this for many years to access my home services and, more recently, to self-host using NPM as my reverse proxy.\n I have Namecheap as my domain registrar and while setting up my Archer C7, I discovered that Namecheap has an article specifically for configuring DD-WRT-powered routers. I was able to follow these instructions successfully, and saw that the WAN IP I have was updated properly in Namecheap's portal, so I know that's working.\n However, I cannot hit any of my services at their appropriate DNS entries. I've already confirmed the ports are forwarded, and used a port checker. I can use <WAN IP>:<PORT> and it works fine, so I know it's an issue with my DNS config, just not sure where.\n Prior to swapping routers, my DNS entries in Namecheap were:\n CNAME record, *, <ASUS DDNS domain name> CNAME record, www, <mydomainname>.com\n My new namecheap records include an A+ Dynamic DNS record, but I'm not sure how to map the entries.\n Appreciate any help with this, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/radakul  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a home server that's running a number of different services. Some of them are typical web servers each running in their own Docker container, with nginx delegating web requests to the right server based on subdomain. Others are non-web services running on a specific port. (e.g. OpenVPN, ssh, a game server, etc.)\n What I'd like to do is prioritize each service so that they all get a certain percentage of my total bandwidth, depending on which services are active and using bandwidth. This however includes differentiating between the different web servers and the non-web services, which makes it tricky.\n Here's an example:\n  \nhttps​://foo.mydomain.com has a priority of 6\n OpenVPN has a priority of 3\n ssh has a priority of 2\n https​://bar.mydomain.com has a priority of 1\n all uncategorized outgoing traffic (such as normal user web traffic) has a priority of 1\n  \n...therefore if all four are uploading at once, foo.mydomain.com gets twice the upstream bandwidth as OpenVPN, three times as much bandwidth as ssh, and six times as much as bar.mydomain.com or regular user web traffic.\n Further, if any these services or web servers are being accessed on my LAN, then I don't want there to be any bandwidth limiting at all. ~(So I think that excludes being able to use limit_rate directive in my nginx configuration.)~ edit: Nope, I figured out how to use limit_rate depending on source IP.\n I know this kind of thing can be done at the router level with the right QoS feature, except that kind of QoS is based on what port the traffic is coming through. In the case of web servers, it's all coming through on port 443 so I can't use that to distinguish between them!\n Is there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?\n    submitted by    /u/guygizmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're a small triathlon club, and I'm looking for a self-hosted shared calendar where all the members can add their own races/competitions, and any other member can add itself as attender, no need to send any invitation. For example:\n If I've a race in 2 months, I add this race on this shared calendar. Other member has the same race, and go to this shared calendar to add it. When see this race is already created (by me), just add itself as attender. If other member are looking for some race in few weeks/months, and see in a race there is already 2 people, maybe just helps to decide to sign in to this race too (and add itself as attender).\n I tried the Nextcloud calendar, but I think only has attenders if already has been invited. One approach can be every attender just add the name into a comments section, but will be more visual to use the \"attenders\" section.\n Is there any similar calendar to do this? Maybe something like Eventbrite, but integrated in a self-hosted platform like Nextcloud to manage users...\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/netyaco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Long story short, I ended up using Technetium DNS server because it allowed me to filter domains and also use DoT (DNS over TLS). However, being the paranoid internet user that I am, I feel the need to test whether the DoT is actually working, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.\n I've tried this tool and I'm a bit confused by the results https://1.1.1.1/help\n When I use DoT with Quad9 it tells me that my DNS requests are not encrypted, but if I instead use Cloudflare's DoT it says everything is working. Since the tool is made by Cloudflare I am wondering whether the results are accurate. I would prefer it if I could use the Quad9 DoT.\n Are there any good (impartial) tools for testing DoT?\n Edit: I realised that it might be good to also include that I've set the Technetium DNS server as my default DNS in my router, so my entire network should be covered by it.\n    submitted by    /u/SureAstronomer9  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings,\n I have a few services in my homelab that are reliant upon the apache2 web server.\n There were a few configuration vulnerabilities flagged by my vulnerability scanner with guidance to update the values in httpd.conf ( /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) in the case of ubuntu 20.04 that i'm running\n I made those changes such as modifying the following values\n (Options None) for root directory\n TraceEnable off \n ServerTokens ProductOnly \n ServerSignature off \n LimitRequestline 512 LimitRequestFields 100 LimitRequestFieldsize 1024 LimitRequestBody 102400 \n ​\n I've however stumbled upon some comments since then that modifying these values directly in the apache2.conf file isn't a good practice as that file can occasionally be replaced during a package update and conf.d is preferable. I've also read some conflicting information that the conf.d directory is deprecated\n ​\n ​\n What is currently considered best practice for making persistent config changes such as setting TraceEnable off ?\n    submitted by    /u/bananna_roboto  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm already using this tool to manage my own cluster and applications, but it's still at an early stage. In addition, the number of compatible applications is currently limited, but I plan to add more soon. The goal of the project is to make self-hosting on Kubernetes easier and more accessible.\n If you are interested, there are two tutorials that show how it can be use: https://openlizz.com/docs/tutorials.\n As I said, this project is in its early stages and I'm very interested in any feedback, comments, or even maybe contributions.\n GitHub: https://github.com/openlizz/lizz\n Looking forward to discussing in the comments :)\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Art_7603  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "https://tombursch.github.io/kitchenowl/\n So I think it's finally time to create a dedicate post for my personal project KitchenOwl. I've mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.\n KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven't cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.\n If you're interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.\n Why did I create KitchenOwl?\n Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That's when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That's when I decided to just create my own app.\n It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.\n ​\n Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/T0mxD  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just recently, I've managed to setup a free Pbx box and got that all going. Port 443, 80, clearly Ip, and then a udp port range of 10001 to 20000.\n All works but then I thought that it was a little exposing. Nginx proxy manager, vanilla nginx, traefik, not sure it's possible. Standard 443 and 80 is pretty straight forward, however, a port range seemed a little more complex.\n Ssh forwarded through I think is what they call the stream option in nginx. Can that be done in nginx proxy manager too? Reading into it it seems that nginx can do a port range too but I'm just not clear on it.\n Has anyone done this or would be kind enough to offer their two cents?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/ecarlin  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently helping out my dad who owns a very small company that primarily does work as a utility contractor. Our family has been in the industry since the 80's/90's and because of an abundance of paper files and bad practices it is impossible to find anything you are looking for and slows down daily operations in the office. My dad would like to transition to a completely digital system with my help. After some research I have decided on a paperless filing system using a DMS such as Paperless-ngx or Papermerge self hosted with backups to a cloud based solution. We would only need to access the documents on location but being able to outside wouldn't hurt unless that adds complications. Documents would be everything from invoices, bills, tax records, bank statements, time cards, etc. Essentially anything that doesn't need to be kept in its paper form we would like to convert over.\n I need help deciding on the hardware (NUC, NAS, Old Desktop, etc.), any applications I might want to host and use alongside of the DMS, best backup options (can I just use google drive, onedrive, etc?), and anything else you can think of that might be useful to know starting out.\n If at all possible I would like to be able to run two instances of this solution for two different businesses under the same roof. Ideally the hardware would be powerful enough to allow this and maybe some room for growth. Also while on the topic of going digital there were talks of doing some sort of DocuSign for the second business and if that's something that can be self hosted or at the very least be backed up that would be great. Price is a large consideration, but If it is worth the price in quality of life improvement/time savings I will consider it. \n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/asoberdash  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, so I got into self hosting recently by setting up a raspberry pi with an external harddrive as NAS with Open Media Vault and the hobby kinda catched me so I would like to expand a little bit by getting some small server hardware that has more capabilities than a pi. What would be your reccomendations for taking the 'next step'? Is there common server hardware that is sold used on ebay often for a good price? I would like something like a low power consumption server having at least 16GB of ram and a fairly strong cpu, powerful enough to run some docker containers at the same time, ideally maybe even a game server as container. It would be perfect if it could be upgraded easily by adding some more ram and maybe even switching out the cpu to a more powerful model at some point. Regarding the price I'm ready to spend up to 300-400$ excluding harddrives, if that would be sufficient?

Ideally, it should be a one time setup so that the user really only authenticates with Nextcloud going forward after the initial configuration.\n I do not want to use a VPN because it is not as user friendly, it gives people access to my devices and you can only reliably run a single VPN at a time so I would not be able to use a VPN provider at the same time.\n Any ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/progta763  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over the past few years I've been working on an open source project called Micro, an API first development platform and I'm now sharing Micro Services, a catalog of reusable real world Micro services.\n Most of what's here was built with the goal of offering a cloud service to developers but it is something that is entirely self hostable and actually an avenue I'd like to personally explore more. I've always taken a local first approach to development and Micro + Micro Services can be run locally. \n A few years ago I was experimenting with running Micro on a Raspberry Pi and even offering some sort of official image. Longer term I'd like to build in a UI for querying services and a secure network. \n Predominantly the goal of the project is to create a set of services that can be an open alternative to what exists already. Currently we offload a lot to the cloud and provide a single unified querying layer but if more could be built into each service they could truly be a self hosted alternative. \n Would love to get some feedback on how this could become a defacto self hosted solution.\n https://micro.dev/blog/2022/09/27/real-world-micro-services.html\n https://github.com/micro/services/\n    submitted by    /u/Individual-Tear3556  \n [link]   [comments]",

They should be able to open this link on their browser and view/download only whatever is shared with them using the link.\n I was using Onedrive for this. A python script used to copy the files into the onedrive subfolder, and I had enabled share on the folder and sent the link. That was when I was using my windows PC.\n I've since transitioned to a VM on Digital Ocean, and to use the Onedrive APIs I need to pay for a subscription and start an Azure account which I really don't want to do.\n Is there any free or self hosted option to achieve this?\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/mr_claw  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past, I used to have the webGUI exposed to the internet, but because a lot of vulnerabilities were discovered, I disabled this.\n A couple of friends used the webGUI to save photo's to my NAS and I also used it a lot for link file sharing. This was my preferred way to share files over 30MB+. I can also use different internet services, but this is r/selfhosted :D\n I preferably don't want to expose the webGUI anymore, but I do want to share files via this NAS. I think a Synology would be the best option when I want to do this. Is there a something I'm missing as a potential option to share (and upload) files securely from the internet?\n //edit: Side-note. I'm not going to expose my home IP anymore. I have a site-to-site VPN running to a virtualized environment in a datacenter. When I'm going to expose it, I will use a reverse proxy in my datacenter environment, to access the webGUI of the NAS at my home network.\n    submitted by    /u/DannyvdM42  \n [link]   [comments]",

Do I need a DDNS service that will give me a domain to my router's (also the DNS at my home) IP?\n \nMaybe related to the first question, do I need a local DNS server in my home?\n \nWhat do I setup in NPM after creating the sub domain?\n \nWhere do SSL certs come into this and how do I utilize them in this setup?\n \n Thank you :)\n Edit:\n Forgot to mention VPN.

Will work on that then.

This is my config right now:\n json { \"name\": \"mynet\", \"cniVersion\": \"0.4.0\", \"plugins\": [ { \"type\": \"bridge\", \"isDefaultGateway\": true, \"ipMasq\": true, \"ipam\": { \"type\": \"host-local\", \"ranges\": [ [ { \"subnet\": \"172.22.0.0/16\" } ] ] } } ] } \n Nomad parses the config, gives no error message. So far so good. Now here is my job file for pihole:\n ```hcl job \"pihole\" { datacenters = [\"dc1\"]\n group \"pihole\" {\n network { mode = \"cni/mynet\" port \"http\" { static = 80 to = 80 } port \"DNS\" { static = 53 to = 53 } } task \"pihole\" { driver = \"docker\" env { TZ = \"Europe/Budapest\" VIRTUAL_HOST = \"pi.hole\" PROXY_LOCATION = \"pi.hole\" FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 = \"127.0.0.1\" WEBPASSWORD = \"piholepass\" } config { image = \"pihole/pihole:latest\" ports = [\"http\", \"DNS\"] ipv4_address = \"172.22.0.2\" volumes = [ \"/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole\", \"/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d\", ] } } \n } }\n ```\n If I use network.mode = \"bridge\" and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine. However this version starts up normally, but it can not reach the internet:\n  [✗] DNS resolution is currently unavailable \n I have checked that CNI takes care of routing, the proper nat tables show up with ifconfig.\n Any idea how should I fix this?

All the apps that rely on \"outside access\" (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan <-> router (pppoe) <-> lan <-> nginx reverse proxy <-> apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns \"autobots\".\n In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started \"falling off\" from my services. My phone wouldn't sync with NextCloud, people's locations didn't update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if \"my\" domains were \"listed\" on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren't propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).\n I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.\n Does anyone know what's going on?

I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. \n The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.\n This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I'd like to play with kubernetes a bit. I've already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.\n However, I still don't understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I'd assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.\n If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.\n Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server? Is the increased complexity worth it anyhow?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/sk1nT7  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm currently accessing my self hosted applications through a VPN (ZeroTier). The problem with this approach is that each user that wants to use a service, or even myself, needs to join the ZT network, and have it enabled. Even if other people were not to use the network, it's still bothersome to me, since the ZT network on my phone consumes a lot of battery, and all the traffic is going through it which I'm not too fond of.\n So the option is obviously opening ports. However this has security risks which I don't want to have, and I began looking for alternatives. It seems that a tunnel with Cloudflare would be a good option, but there's some thing I want to understand about it.\n Cloudflare seems to simplify security, since they automatically detect and block suspicious connections, and they offer many tools to manually restrict connections with various arbitrary filters. However, let's say that there's some services I self host that I want to allow everyone to access, and there's some others that I want to restrict to selected users, how risky is this? Isn't a chain as strong as its weakest link?\n If I have an application open to the public, couldn't a vulnerability in that application compromise my entire network? Assume each application is running on its own docker container of course.\n I use a reverse proxy with nginx to access each service with a subdomain. Does Cloudflare limit my ability to do this in any way? I saw that I may need to add applications one by one, can I use a wildcard redirect or something?\n And also, does Cloudflare have data limits and speed limits? Since all my traffic would be going through them via the tunnel... I guess this is par for the course. It would really suck if that's the case, but I guess deep down I already know the answer.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "What happened?\n Hello all. I had to make a very painful data loss a few days ago due to an update error from NextCloudPi and had no backup for some now lost files.\n This now brings me to the point that I finally want to think about a backup strategy and I definitely need your help. I've always read a lot about this, but couldn't really do anything with it because it was too abstract.\n What is the current status?\n I have a RAID 1 system with 2x 4TB NAS hard drives connected to my Ubuntu server. I never expected that a software error could delete all my cloud files, but now I've been proven wrong. I don't do automated backups at all. At most, I manually copy the most important things to an external hard drive every few months.\n The file system is ext4.\n What I know could be helpful\n I know for example that there is btrfs as a file system and there is snapshot, but there it already starts, because I do not understand the functionality. Could that have helped me in my case where all the files were deleted? Then I know that there is rsync, which does more or less the same thing that RAID 1 already does (if I understood correctly).\n ​\n Of course, it would also be very efficient to save the data again on an external hard drive, for example. But I don't know how this can be automated, because it would have to be connected all the time, which would quickly exceed the life of the hard drive. I definitely want to keep everything local and not fall back on external cloud providers such as Mega, Google, OneDrive, etc.\n ​\n So let's first discuss the best realization in my case and possibly afterward how the whole thing is technically feasible. I want to make a backup of everything and not only of the data in the cloud but also of the rest. Thank you very much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/CptDayDreamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just shipped a product called Gardens: https://joingardens.com/apps. 📷\n PaaS (platform-as-a-service) refers to a model where the service helps you provision and run a platform for hosting apps and/or apps themselves without the hassle usually associated with it.\n New PaaS solutions show up pretty often, but they're either proprietary, lock you in, or aren't friendly for non-developers.Gardens solves all of that. Here's what it does:\n  - Makes setting up your own PaaS with an admin panel and setting up apps easy as cake. You don't need to know how to code; there's a library of 130+ apps available. They're set up in one click\n  - Does not lock you in. Your data as well as the PaaS application itself (Caprover) stays in your cloud. We support DigitalOcean but will add more providers soon\n - Has social features. While the whole self-hosting infra stays on your cloud, the main site features step-by-step guides and posts from big open-source companies to help find and share knowledge\n Curious to hear what the community here thinks! Gardens is open-source on Github, and accepting feature requests. Hope you'll like it!\n    submitted by    /u/joingardens  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am currently self hosting my storage solutions using truenas in a VM that is not exposed remotely. I am looking for some software solutions for the following tasks: \n  \nRemote uploading photos from wherever I am. I would like to be able to make backups easily. Deduplication would be nice feature here. This would need security but I believe nginx can handle that.\n File download if someone has a link, username, and password ( does not have to be super secure but ddos protection would be nice). To share files with people and event organizers when relevant. Zipping would be nice\n Basic file/directory exploration. I would like to be able to share a single photo with people or see if I have a photo of a particular bird species .\n  \nWhat I have tried:\n  \nLibre photos does not seem to have upload or download tools and not directory structure\n Next cloud seems to be a lot more that I need and doesn't seem to play nice with truenas for me at least accessing existing files.\n Currently I manually make zip files for sharing and link them in html tag for download but that can be time intensive\n  \nI would prefer FOSS but I am willing to talk if it's cheap enough.

          "description": "Hi all - I've been slowly building up my lab from having a single 6-core server to also having a few older generation NUCs and a laptop. With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don't care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.\n Now, I've installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it's really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. \n So my questions are: \n 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? \n 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).\n 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?\n 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?\n Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out. Sorry if some of those questions are basic, I wasn't able to get conclusive answers on the web.\n    submitted by    /u/manjerico  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past week I have had 2 days where I was able to watch youtube, download things without issue. Just now I unplugged the supplied modem/router thing and the inline poe injector. Speeds jumped from .04mbs down to 25mbs down. The more speed tests I have done the more the speed has dropped and In the time I have wrote this post I am back down to 6mbs or so. Is there anything I can do, hardware wise to fix this issue before I start losing hair. Switching isps is not possible. The one I use is the only one to offer a unlimited plan in my area.

After doing a little research online and consulting some local Bestbuy guys, I was suggested to use a mesh wifi system to extend the range of my router, so I picked up an eero 6 to do this.\n The only issue is that its speeds are up to 500mbps, and I have AT&T fiber, so my average speeds are up to 1gbps. The server will be at the other end of the house in the basement from the router (the house is about 1000sqft), and I'm afraid that connecting the mesh to my router and then placing one of the eero nodes in the basement to directly connect to the NAS will drop my speeds considerably. Is this a legitimate concern to have? If I absolutely must, I can wire it with ethernet to the ISP-provided router.\n    submitted by    /u/TrippieBled  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had experience with running a 2U server already but with this new one being 4 nodes I want to look into booting them over PXE. I have looked through many guides and they all seem to say similar things, but I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a concrete answer to if someone with experience can help with PXE.\n So with it being 4 nodes I don't want to use 4 different bays just to boot each of them up, I plan on using them for different use cases (a next cloud, and other hosted web-services) and my biggest question is if PXE is a suitable solution for this.\n It seems like PXE is really meant to only boot up installation media to install onto a local disk, so does that mean it isn't really for my use case, since I'm trying to avoid allocating 4 bays just for each node's boot drive. I have heard of iPXE which then uses ISCSI or NFS for persistant user data, which seems to be what I want, but I'm not looking for each node to boot the same files as they will have completely different use cases.\n Anyway, my main question is this, I want to be able to boot all 4 nodes up and each node just running like a standalone server that each has their own web-services to host, all while booting from a PXE server so that I don't have to have a local disk for each of the 4 nodes. I am not looking for someone to explain how to set it all up, I just want to know if PXE booting can do this for me or if I'm sort of barking up the wrong tree and should be looking at a different method entirely.\n    submitted by    /u/BootyMcJudy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Greetings,\n I just purchased 2 disk shelves (SYS-937R-E2JB), one with a compute module and I've never had something like this. I currently have 2 x R620s that I want to turn into a Proxmox Cluster. \n My current plan is to use the compute module on this to install something like TrueNAs, put a 10 gig NIC inside, and have it act as the shared storage for the proxmox HA cluster. Will this work? \n My second question is how best to set things up as it's another area I'm very noobish with. If I go with TrueNAS, I assume I can setup multiple disk pools/file systems? I've got two primary goals:\n  \nHigh speed disk storage for my VMs (only a dozen or so, but I'm impatient, so fast disk IO would be nice). I'd love to be able to clone an ubuntu template in a matter of minutes. \n Raw storage for my media library and other personal documents (with the appropriate backups in place). Current storage usage is around 18 TB on Unraid. \n  \nWith the above in mind, I was thinking about trying ZFS in a mirrored config (raid 10 equivalent) for the VM disk storage, and maybe another pool that is made up of raidz2 for the media? \n I could also try something like ceph or gluster with the 2 x R620s, and just put 6 x SAS drives in each one...that would eliminate the need for a high performance raid in the disk shelf. My goal is a redundant cluster as I want to start self hosting some important things and would prefer to avoid the risk of downtime etc. \n ​\n At this point I'd appreciate any general suggestions/advice. I'm not even sure if I can do what I'm thinking, and if I can do it, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. I did some reading up yesterday on trying to implement high IO ZFS for VM storage and it got over my head pretty quickly.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been running XCP-NG on it for years now. Looking to replace the server soon and may change hypervisors. I've run ESXi before but have not dived too deep into it. Does ESXi have these features or some equivalent?\n  \nCan vCenter manage the host behind a virtual network? Some background, the server only has 1 physical uplink that grabs my one IP. This IP goes straight into pfSense so the host itself has no physical network access. Because of this, I have to configure Xen Orchestra to manage the host via virtual adapters.\n Does vCenter offer \"resource groups\"? Xen Orchestra allows you to create Resource Sets. These are set limits on CPU/RAM/Storage that I can assign to a user or user group. This is great for allowing friends to play on my server without touching my stuff. I create a resource group, give them some resources, and they can then login into Xen Orchestra and create/modify/remove VMs at their will. They can't go over their resource limits, and they can't see or modify my VMs at all.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/LV_GC  \n [link]   [comments]",

The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.\n Of course, results will be posted back to this subreddit. Given that I no longer have any academic constraints, I should be able to post more detailed results than last year, and hopefully somewhat faster ;)\n I have already communicated with the moderators and gotten permission for this post.\n    submitted by    /u/SelfHostingAutomated  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago I bought a bunch of old used parts on eBay and build a modest server. It's a 4c/8T Xeon, m-ITX SuperMicro board, in a Node 804 case. I currently have 2x SSD cache and 5x HDD. I learned a lot but I've outgrown it and really want an upgrade. A few things I learned:\n  \nRegret the Node 804 case. Was a pain to build in. I wish I went full size ATX with a vertical stack of 8 drive bays. Eyeing the Fractal Design Define 7.\n Liked the piece of mind of ECC RAM and dual Ethernet\n IPMI came in clutch a few times\n I don't have enough cores/threads, I'd want at least 8c/16T next time\n I don't have enough PCI slots, only had enough room for one transcode GPU for Plex and one SAS card to expand the 6 SATA ports\n I wish I got a CPU with Intel QuickSync to use for Plex\n  \nSo to address the PCI issue, I figured a board with 10 SATA slots (2x SSD cache, inevitable 8x HDD) would clear that up, be better for cable management, and be one less point of failure vs my SAS card. Plus if I could find a CPU with ECC and QuickSync I'd save a PCI slot. Now I'd have enough room for 1-2 GPUs to finally have better VM performance. I'd want 1 light gaming VM and 1 productivity/streaming VM which could benefit from a basic GPU. If I ever needed more drives I still have my SAS card. So 3 PCI total.\n Another thought, is 10gbe worth it? None of my devices are ready for it, but how nice is it for future proofing? My main computer is an M1 MacBook Pro so I at least have Thunderbolt 4.\n Lastly, I can see a benefit in having a second cache pool for VMs. Probably just a single M.2 drive for VMs.\n The issue with all of the above, is it seems a board that supports: ECC, IMPI, M.2, 10x SATA 6gb/s, Dual 10gbps Ethernet, is $570 which is a lot to go for. It seems only the SuperMicro X11SPI-TF checks all those boxes. Is it worth it in the long run? Or what compromises should I have? I'd appreciate any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/New_Mud_1723  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi. \n I want to set up a VPN so that servers that I connect through it doesn't know I am connecting through VPN. I used WireGuard on rented VPS for those purposes. But the main problem is that VPN server IP is easily recognized as IP that belongs to hosting provider. So what I decided to do is to put Raspberry Pi at my home and set up WireGuard on it. \n But I run into a problem. I need to be able to connect to WireGuard server (peer) from outside. And my internet provider doesn't provide me with a public IP to my router, rather than router is behind internet provider NAT which I can't control.\n There is an option to opt into static IP. But they might have a separate pool of static IP, which may raise some red flags that I might be using a VPN. Also, preferably, I wanted to have different incoming and outgoing IPs of my VPN.\n One of the possible ways is reverse tunnels to Raspberry Pi. But since ping is also an issue, I either have to have a server in the same city or use a direct connection.\n What are my best options? My main priorities are to keep my VPN IP less suspicious and keep ping as low as possible (but the distance between server and client is 7000km+, so extra 10-20 ms won't matter).\n If reverse tunnel to can I do it all purely on WireGuard. Let's say I have peer with public IP to which both VPN server and client are connected, and use VPN server as gateway on my client?\n And are there any options to connect directly? I heard something about STUN, but haven't tried it.\n    submitted by    /u/dani0854  \n [link]   [comments]",

And will be a lot funnier too :)\n I also have an old QNAP NAS, that I use to store media and backups.

Currently running 24x 3TB drives dual Xeon E5645 CPUs (12c/24t total) and 128GB RAM. Like I said it's aging and now that storage has come down significantly I'd like to replace some drives for Plex and use some of these in RAID10 for a private/personal cloud. \n My parents don't get cloud anything. Their 2TB backup drive, when not misplaced, is about half full, so I shared my M365 user acct so they have that to backup to, but it'd be so nice to be able to host stuff for my family and parents/siblings. That way any time they need help recovering folks or logging in/accessing, we're not resetting passwords or I'm remoting in to unlock, etc.. be nice to just send a link or have it as a mapped network drive or something. Yes their OneDrive is currently hosting the user files in Windows, but still. Something I'd like to get into just because.

(Also, I'm not sure if this is permitted in the sub, but looks like there is no rule mentioning not to ask for help choosing parts)\n As the title mentions, I need help picking parts for my upcoming server. Now before you jump at me, I have read the subreddit hardware guide but I'm not looking for a business server as it would be too loud.\n So, I have already chosen some parts (correct me if there is something to change to the existing chosen ones). Now, the CPU, Motherboard, and RAM are missing (the rest I will figure it out).\n The CPU would need to sustain at least this load, and a good overhead for future proofing, since I'm planning for keeping this around a long time (4-5 years) and more services will pop-up.\n The motherboard, well, I just need it to accommodate the basics + HBA & GPU\n The RAM, I would need it ECC, since I would be running TrueNAS (in a VM). 32gb should be fine but 64gb would be grate.\n The rest (CPU Cooler, Case, PSU, Fans) I think I can figure it out myself. \n Any help is appreciated and have a great one!\n    submitted by    /u/EricThunderG  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all, I'm pretty new to this homelab stuff is please forgive me if this question is too basic. I did some searching about power on this forum and found a lot of guys quoting large numbers but the info on the setup was lacking.\n I am currently looking at acquiring a HP Proliant DL580 G8 4x Xeon E7-4890 4x 1200w and running a project that hopefully will eventually end up with it being maxed out (Lots of virtual machines).\n Now maybe I'm reading this wrong but according to the specs it says that each processor can pull 1200 watts max? Which checks out with the unit having four power supplies?\n My doubt is that since this is a home setup your average room's plug/circuit maxes out at a 1500w pull. Which means if each processor goes above 25% usage then it will blow the circuit. \n Does this mean that people who run these out of their homes have massively beefed up their office/lab wiring to deliver all that power, or does the server just not actually pull that much at normal/low operation? \n I'm happy to start off slow and just run one VM or two on the server while I figure out the power issue, but I'm trying to get an idea from you guys if I need to upgrade my houses wiring (since I do plan on maxing it out eventually), and if I do need to upgrade the home then how much do I realistically expect to draw with it running at low utilization at the beginning when I am learning? Would one plug be enough? An extension cord from another room and have two power supplies plugged in each?\n Thanks for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/OuchLOLcom  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Im curious if such a thing exists. The way I imagine it working would be in conjunction with a reverse proxy. Basically anytime someone types in \"service.mydomian.com\" the connection will initially be blocked. I would then recieve a notification on my phone or an email saying something to the effect of \"111.111.111.111 is trying to connect to service.mydomain.com\" and then provide the options of \"Trust, Allow, Deny\". \n ​\n I like the idea of having yet another layer of security on my internet facing services. However from what I can tell things like Authellia would work just fine for loggining in from a webbrowser, but most of the things I have hosted are used through a companion mobile app and from what I can tell Authellia or others wouldnt work in that scenerio. \n However if the Authentication was done on a secondary device and was completely invisible to the mobile app then I imagine it would work. Such as if I had a friend that I wanted to let use my server, they would download the app and try to login. On the first attempt they will just get an error that says they cant connect. But then I would get notified of the attempted connection where I can choose to permanently trust their IP, Allow it once, or Deny it. Then they try to login again and are able to connect. \n ​\n Does something like this exist?

          "description": "Let me preface this by saying this is my fault for not reading the fine print, not the ebay seller's.\n I bought a set of four 600GB Toshiba AL13SEB600 sas drives to use in an HPE Proliant DL360 G6 server. I didn't read the part of the description that says \"these drives are for NetApp Servers\", figuring any old 2.5 sas drive would work. Unfortunately all four drives give me the orange 'drive failed' light and don't show up at all in the P410i raid card config menu. I know the slots and raid card are good, since the original 72GB drives still work fine. So it seems that the seller was right that they can only be used in a NetApp server (or they're broken, which I have no way of knowing). The thing is, I'm pretty sure from the datasheet that these are not special drives or anything, they should be regular old sas drives.\n Edit: I forgot to mention, the DL360 G6 datasheet does say that the server can handle a maximum of 4TB (8x500GB) storage, but I don't think that's the problem, since I've connected over 5TB of mixed drives, including one 3TB drive, and it's functioned without issue.\n Which leads me to my question. How could drives be configured in such a way that they work on one system (netapp), but completely fail at the hardware level in another (HP)? Beyond that, how can I reformat them to work in my HP server (assuming they're actually functional)?\n Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm very new to enterprise type stuff and I didn't see anything helpful in my quick googling.\n    submitted by    /u/Darkextratoasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

Previously, I had Home Assistant running on a Pi 4 4gb but wanted to move that to something larger so I could use one machine for more than just that.\n I'm running Proxmox, and so far have Home Assistant OS and MineOS currently running in their own VMs. The only other thing I wanted to do is install pfSense to use as a router/firewall for our network. Would this system be able to handle all of this? I'm looking at going up to 32gb of RAM, but are four cores/eight threads enough for all of those things? I just want to make sure any of those VMs wouldnt be bogged down by the other. \n Currently, MineOS has 2 cores and 8GB RAM, HA has 2 cores and 4GB RAM. I was going to do 1 core for pfSense and 1-2GB RAM. The Minecraft server is mostly idle except for maybe one night a week when my buddies and I get on, which is usually at most five of us. HA doesnt ever seem to use much CPU.\n I'm looking at NICs and am looking at Intel ones since I know theyre a bit better and require lower CPU usage. We have 500mbps internet and may upgrade at some point to gigabit. \n I'm new to this all, so any help is much appreciated. Thank you so much\n    submitted by    /u/Not-An-Astronaut-69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to expand my homelab but am running low on physical space to put servers in where noise is acceptable. My first thought was my crawl space, but there are a few problems which need to be overcome to pull this off like temperature and humidity control, access restrictions and cabeling.\n Cabeling for me is easy since the breaker panel and switching is right above it and just need new cables.\n The crawl space is hard to access but having some redundancy in disks and IPMI control on my servers will help out a lot since I don't need to access it daily anyway.\n But the last big problem is temperature and humidity control. I placed a sensor which measures that and logged it for 5 months. In peak summer it never went above 24 degrees and now in autumn it did not went below 18. This is good since it is never too hot and hopefully not too cold even in freezing weather. There are also ventilation holes in case the lab produces too much heat.\n But the humidity! It never went below 95% relative humidity in the summer and in the last month 100%. I read trough the manuals of the hardware I have and it is all rated for below 90%. Hard drives won't be a problem since they are helium sealed. \n So I think this won't be such a problem because humidity only condenses on cold surfaces and servers inherently get warm. Along with the heat it all produces it might push the relative humidity down and not be such a problem.\n I might also put a fan against the exhaust vents in case it gets really bad but I'd rather not because that will definitely screw with the house's isolation since crawl spaces are for isolation of the house.\n Has anyone experience with a setup like this?\n location is the Netherlands btw. house is below water level but water never occurs in the space, it is just really humid\n    submitted by    /u/Wide_Perception_4983  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For folks who don't know, Drobo is a NAS type device which creates redundant storage from a bunch of disks, but the key thing is that the disks don't need to match in size. In fact, to increase the size of the storage, you can replace the drives one at time and let it rebuild between each swap, and soon enough you'll have increased the size of array.\n My question is, is there any way i can implement this without a drobo? I've got a pile of mismatched 2.5\" drives which on their own are next to useless, but as part an array they could have quite a bit more life.\n For reference, I'm thinking about a case like this:\n https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Drive-Docking-Station-DS-4SSD/dp/B0711L68MS/\n    submitted by    /u/AuthenticImposter  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would be passing it through to probably a Debian VM. All I'm looking to get out of it is the ability to run a desktop on a monitor in my server rack and display a Grafana output. Is there anything with less capable cards that would make them a bad candidate for GPU pass-through? \n Alternative option could possibly be a USB3.0 PCIe card with a USB to VGA adapter.\n I have a gigabyte GV-N210D3-1GI laying around that ill try testing with, but it's probably more capable than i need.\n    submitted by    /u/tiberiusgv  \n [link]   [comments]",

All devices continue to work without issue during power flickers (PCs, Monitors, Proxmox Cluster, NAS) but my core switch in the basement will reboot. I'm wondering if it's a load issue on the UPS or if it's not of high enough quality to handle the load when switching over for that 1 second.\n The UPS is a CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD 1500VA/900W with ~450W loadThe switch is a Brocade/Ruckus ICX 6610 with both psu's plugged in.Other devices on the UPS is 3x Lenovo Tiny and a DIY NAS running TrueNAS.All 5 of these devices are on a CyberPower PDU.\n ​\n Edit: Thanks for the responses.

Especially that it turns out the 5C NFC is actually 15 EUR, not 10 and shipping is an extra 5 EUR (not free). Plus maybe VAT and fees because I don't live in the EEU.\n Right now, I'm using Bitwarden Premium. It has 2FA for every service that supports it. It's on my iPhone and in my browser. Whenever a site needs a TOTP, Bitwarden automatically fills it in. Services that use SMS as 2FA suck, there aren't many, and when they do that there is no option to use anything else than SMS anyway (or I'd be using Bitwarden for them)\n It's not like it's a hassle to get Bitwarden to enter the TOTP (on the phone or the computer), and I almost never receive the TOTP over SMS.\n So... What does a Yubikey do for me there? It doesn't feel like I need one, and I'd rather avoid spending money just for the sake of it.

This case would only fit 2 HDDs, which would be sufficient for now. The power consumption could be a bit high, but most likely still better than any Build I could pull off.\n I am unsure if this is a good route to Go, or if I should just get a Synology of sorts, tho they are pretty expensive and not as easily upgradable.

          "description": "I wanted to upgrade the homelab, and seeing the cost/availability of Raspberry Pis, I bought some cheap Lenovo M73 Tinys instead. As a fun experiment, I wanted to see how much I could get out of them. Namely, will it have enough horsepower to run vCenter, vSAN, and Tanzu Kubernetes. \n Result: it technically works. Which is the best kind of works! There is hardly any room for any workload, and likely would not survive if a host failed. Also, each host only has a single 1gb NIC, which means the little switch they're plugged into is pretty much saturated (Ubiquiti Flex Mini). But honestly I am surprised at how smoothly things are running, considering all the performance metrics. vCenter is snappy and vmotions of smallish VMs are only a couple minutes. No perceptible issues, although I'm not running anything particularly heavy.\n https://imgur.com/a/2eieR9l\n 3x Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 Tiny with i3-4130T upgraded to 16gb of RAM (their max allowed). PCIe to M.2 adapter and an additional 256gb NVME drive (replaced the wifi card to be used as vSAN cache. Technically all-flash, but configured as Hybrid to cut down on Memory overhead). All in, under $400 total.\n If I were to do it again, I'd probably shell out for m700 tinys which can get up to 32gb of RAM. I didn't go for them in the first place because they would be significantly more expensive and I wasn't ready to spend more money for a homelab of my size. (Lets be honest, all I need are a couple Raspberry Pis). I likely will keep vSAN configured and add larger capacity drives to run 'old fashioned' VMs instead of containers.\n    submitted by    /u/ariesgungetcha  \n [link]   [comments]",

After moving around, it didn't have a place and instead ended up in the middle of the floor in the living room with cats all over it (resulting in hair and various other gross things in the parts). I needed to rack it, but with racks come a bunch of new issues I am now learning to deal with. After moving the system over to the new case, the motherboard wouldn't boot. So I elected to get another one, since it had IPMI built in and I was gonna have to get an IPKVM anyway.\n My new configuration is as follows:\n  \nASUS X99-WS/IPMI\n 128GB DDR4-3000 RAM (combination of the previous 64GB kit with another 64GB kit, both kits are from the same manufacturer with the same timings)\n Xeon E5-2696v4\n QNAP QM2-4P-384A\n 2x IBM M5110 (LSI 9207-8i)\n Bunchmore drives\n  \nThis is getting put into a Supermicro 846E16-R1200B (originally bought a Norco RPC-4224 but ended up returning it in favor of a used R1200B). Now I'm running into a host of other issues, namely it seems like there's more headers on this ASUS X99 board than is available on the Supermicro chassis. Is this board incompatible with this case?

When I booted it said it was configuring the new memory setup, but then it disabled the 7th slot for each channel (A7, B7, C7, D7).

I have those installed and have been trying to install Proxmox and have been getting nothing but errors. \n When trying to install using RAIDZ-2 I get an error that the ZFS root pool could not be created. So I tried installing to a single disk and got an error that it was unable to initialize physical volume /dev/sda3. I tried with each of the 4 drives individually and got the same error but instead referencing sdb3, sdc3, and sdd3. \n So I tried going the route of installing Debian first and when trying to just install it on a single disk I got the error: The creation of swap space in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,2,0) (sdc) failed. I tried on each disk and got the same error.\n That was all in HBA mode, so I tried to create a RAID using the H730. Each time I created one (RAID 1, RAID 10, RAID 6) it showed the status of the RAID as failed. When I would go into the Debian installer, neither the array nor the disks showed up so I could tell it wasn't working. \n I have flashed the latest firmware to the RAID card and still no luck. I can't imagine all 4 disks are dead since I bought them from someone on r/homelabsales who had quite a lot of confirmed trades. Can you think of anything I am doing wrong that would prevent me from installing the OS on the server? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/almon17  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the near future the plan is to get a dedicated CUDA gpu fot the atlhon pc.\n Would this pc be a good/viable option to run a 24/7 server runing proxmox ?\n I do have a mini pc (n5095 + 16gbram) running proxmox with a few LXC containers and Hassio on a VM, but I really want to get a way to run a face detection software with gpu processing and maybe a plex server.\n The \"lab\" includes an old rpi4 runing OMV, whitch I would transfer to the Atlhon pc as well.\n Financially speaking this upgrade would cost me less than a server, a used proliant gen8 can be found here for 600 ~ 1000 USD, a used r720 starts at 1500USD and to get the upgraded pc it would cost me something around 350 ~ 450 USD.\n Considering that regular pcs not always get to work well with 24/7 operation and server kind of are made for it, would you recomend? Does it worth the effort to upgrade the pc or its (much) better to wait more (2023.2 probably) to get a real server?\n ​\n Thanks in advance for any tips and sugestions.\n    submitted by    /u/Pedroxns  \n [link]   [comments]",

I dont do anything super stupid (unique passwords for each vm, dont use root for everything, dont have unnecessary ports open, just installed fail2ban) - but I dont take any extra precautions either. \n Any beginner to intermediate hardening tips?\n Would it be worth paying someone some beer money to do some quick easy pentest stuff?\n    submitted by    /u/InfaSyn  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have it working where I can access it on the same vlan as the device I am on, but I want to work on setting it up over a management vlan using the MGMT port on the back of the switch. I have tried a lot of the guides I have found on Google but I am not having any luck on being able to get SSH working through the management port.\n My current setup is this:\n OPNsense router/firewall\n 3850 switch\n 3560CX switch\n My desktop PC on VLAN 10 (192.168.10.200)\n My laptop on VLAN 10 at home (192.168.10.201) and VLAN 69 while on VPN (10.10.69.4)\n Here is the relevant config I have on the 3850 so far: https://pastebin.com/6zspQaXW\n For OPNsense, I have the 3850 management port in igb0 of the router and Gi1/0/1 trunked in to port igb1 of the router.

It used to be 3 masters but a recent update screwed up etcd latency so I've had to go down to a dedicated single master.\n I used to run rook ceph for storage. I really liked how it \"just worked™\" and I could mess with the cluster all day and not worry about data loss. Adding disks was so simple, just plug in a blank disk and it sucks it up. It doesn't natively support arm though so it was hacky and hard to update.\n I moved to Longhorn, but longhorn has a lot of issues. I have to constantly babysit it.\n I want to move to an x86 cluster, ideally with 3 masters and room to expand workers. If each node had a boot dive and space for a secondary drive for rook ceph to use, that would be awesome.

That's what I want to do.\n I have a mirrored RAIDZ of 18TB SATA drives in my Debian VM, currently using a cheap PCIe SATA controller passed through to the VM in Proxmox. However, this is causing the VM to take literally a full minute and a half to boot, and I don't like that. I have been informed that this is likely due to the VM trying to boot from the SATA controller before it gives up and actually boots from the boot drive, which is strange because the boot drive is given priority in the VM settings.\n Whatever the cause, I was told that a decent LSI HBA like the 9211-8i with a firmware flash into IT mode would solve this problem. Indeed, I was informed that the 9211-8i is the go to card for homelabbers to connect their RAIDs to. Old faithful, if you will. So I bought a 9211-8i that is already flashed to IT mode.\n It is a SAS card, and I cannot seem to physically connect the SATA drives to the card. Is there some adapter I need?

I have done a bunch of googling and I keep finding people asking about connecting SAS drives to SATA controllers and the odd other article about how SATA drives and SAS controllers are compatible, but nothing about how to actually do it.\n Can someone please shed some light on this for me?\n EDIT: Wrong card.\n    submitted by    /u/Huecuva  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\n i am running a HP ProLiant ML350 G6 with the following specs:\n  \n1x Intel Xeon X5680, 6 Cores\n 4x Micron 4GB (= 16GB total) ECC RAM, 1333Mhz\n 3x Seagate Ironwolf 4TB SATA, 256MB Cache\n 8x HP 15k 146GB SAS, Hot-Swap 2,5''\n 1x SanDisk SSD Plus 240GB (boot drive)\n 1x Dell Perc H310, Dual SAS as RAID/HBA\n 1x HP SmartArray P410i (integrated)\n  \nMy plan is to use this build as replacement for my former NAS and do some virtualization stuff. So I will try and go for TrueNAS Scale as my OS of choice. But I have a problem setting up my Dell Perc H310.\n My plan is to set up two separate ZFS pools (one with the 4TB drives and one with the 146Gb drives). To achieve this I connected the 4TB drives directly to the Onboard SATA controller of the server. The integrated SAS caddy is wired to the onboard RAID controller (HP SmartArray P410i) which cannot be used in HBA mode to pass the drives to the system in order to use any form of software RAID. So gain access to the drives directly I needed an real HBA to replace this function.\n I ordered an Dell Perc H310, as it is the most common one around here. The setup should be pretty easy compared to other models. But it needs to be flashed into IT-mode manually as mentioned in this guide. As I am struggling with setting up the proper boot drive, because an security feature of my server prevents me from booting of USB drives, I came across a different problem: My server won't boot anything while the HBA is plugged in (any port). The guide told me to wrap some pins with electrical tape to get around this problem, but it won't. The startup screen comes up as normal, but it won't boot my disc or any bootable drive. Across multiple forums people stated that wrapping is key - but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. As soon as I remove the card from my system everything works fine. \n Does anyone experienced something similar or is there an tweak in the BIOS or something? I appreciate all answers!\n    submitted by    /u/mster4x  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm running OPNSense in a VM on my server. The motherboard has 2 onboard GBe NICs and one 10/100 (dedicated to the iKVM remote access). I added a 3rd NIC on a PCIE 1x card. The way I have it setup right now is the PCIE NIC connects to the cable modem and is the incoming signal for OPNSense. One of the onboard NICs feeds from the OPNSense VM to the LAN, and the 3rd one is the host OS's NIC.\n I have noticed some weirdness with my internet speeds where it will sometimes drop to almost unusable speeds and a reboot of the VM fixes it. \n Does anybody think it would be beneficial to offload both the OPNSense VMs NICs to an external card such as this: https://www.newegg.com/intel-e1g42et/p/N82E16833106035 ?\n    submitted by    /u/raduque  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 3 of them since it is mesh. Now google also did something with their updates that most 2G WiFi connected devices wont connect and i had to reboot google at lest once a day. to fix this issue i added TP-Link 1GB router and i disabled WAN and 5G and kept only 2G which worked but it was having issues. Since everything is 1G i switched and made TP-Link main unit and Google 2nd this setup worked but now my network is extremely slow and i have keep switching wifi on my laptop back and forth.\n Can someone with more brain power assist here please\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Airbender12  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I post this just because I occasionally see these for sale on r/homelabsales and elsewhere I picked one up (maybe a year ago). Searching about it yielded not much info - thanks Datto /s. It mostly just sat there as I procrastinated downsizing my homelab. Finally getting around to setting up the hardware I discovered NVMe is not recognized by the bios but post POST the OS can see it. This means I could install an OS on the nvme drive, but couldn't boot from it. It's nearly identical to the zotac zbox mi522nano (even sharing the same model name) and their updated bios addresses this issue. I was unable to flash the bios via USB/dos or even via windows. I did some searching to see if I could be lazy about it, but why not just try to flash it with the zotac firmware - 'what could possibly go wrong?'\n Happy to say that using the CH341A (w/ 3.3v mod) and neoprogrammer v2.1.0.19 to flash the zotac bios (Version 2K160308) on the GD25B64C chip did in fact work and after removing the stupid glowing Datto logo and covering it (from inside) with black vinyl tape, you'd now never know it was a datto box and best of all NVMe boot works as well as using the mPCIe slot for my coral board.\n TL;DR flashing zotac firmware on datto s3x1 worked for me to boot from nvme drive. I had to use CH341a flasher and neoprogrammer software. Posting just for those who may find themselves searching for this in the future as I couldn't find even datto firmware update (unsurprisingly).\n    submitted by    /u/MrDrMrs  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would have to run two 2TB datastores, which would work but want to RAID them and have a single 4TB datastore. Is there an issue with running a single vSAN node for the time being?Im not worried about data risk, I do daily snapshots with the synology. Once I build the 2nd node I can just add it to vcenter and added it to the vSAN cluster. Would this work or am I better off just running two datastores and migrating everything to the 2nd vSAN node when ready then add the 1st node to the cluster.\n    submitted by    /u/PVDnerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Speaking with them, they're saying if the owners agree, they can run a point to point connection from one building to the other. Either wirelessly or just by running a coax cable between the buildings.\n Running the wire is ideal just from a reliability standpoint I think, but I'm not sure the owners and other tenants would love this...

I'd like to be able to host these OSes as VMs on my servers and stream the video, audio, and input to remote clients. Usually people achieve this sort of streaming using Parsec, Steam, or Geforce within the VM. But none of those run on these old OSes, and they shouldn't have network access anyway. Another solution would be to run the old OS inside DOSbox or VMWare Workstation on Windows 10, both of which are designed for high performance local VM interaction, then stream that over Parsec. But this only works well on bare metal. Trying to run this on top of a hypervisor Proxmox [Bare metal] -> Windows 10 [Qemu/KVM] -> Windows 95 [VMWare Workstation] results in nested virtualization, which absolutely trashes the performance of the inner VM on my server hardware. What would be ideal is if the hypervisor could directly handle the streaming of the VMs to remote clients using H.264 instead of VNC or SPICE.\n Does anyone know of a homelab hypervisor solution that is capable of realtime streaming the contents of multiple VMs, without resorting to nested virtualization?

Our contract with TiVo ran out and we are phasing them out, they are past end of life so we were going to recycle all the boxes. One of the guys in the warehouse shucked all the drives, some good, some bad, some close to bad. I've got around 80 drives and want to know the best way to use them. \n I already have an unraid server set up with a 4TB parity drive, but it's pretty much maxed out. I was thinking about buying 2 PCI SATA Cards with 10 SATA conneections each, and then using the onboard sata connectors on a motherboard (which I don't have yet) to run the parity drive along with the cache disks, which I will likely get new 1tb SSD's for. \n I'm not sure how to mount 20 disks though, I was thinking of having my friend (who does 3D design for a living) design me a tower that could hold them all in place and 3D printing that, but it seems like there should be some sort of off the shelf solution. I don't have a rack and was hoping to use / reuse some old PC cases I have already. Any help is appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/nightspades  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everythings run in parallell, mostly to and from one large HDD and i actually sit down and use this computer for personal use as well, mostly not accessing the same HDD other than for some file transfers.\n Running W10.\n I use a program called Netlimiter to monitor and limit/throttle my network usage on a per application level, so i put a ceiling on for example my torrent client to have a maximum upload speed of 500KB/s as to not use up all available bandwidth and ruin it for everything else. (i know many programs gives control of this individually, but not all)\n Im looking for an equivalent but regarding disk I/O. Most of my media is on one large HDD. If this gets indexed, downloaded to, streamed from, unpacked to and library scanned at the same time, it quickly bogs down with 100% disk usage and makes streaming movies locally a buffering, laggy and impossible mess. Kind of defeats the purpose of local streaming.\n Many of the things causing the 100% usage can come at any time or at random, making a movie start buffering and getting stuck halfway through even if everything was fine and the disk wasnt used when the movie started.\n I dont need every process to have access to 100% of the HDDs read-speed at all times whenever the process feels like it. 5% would be enough for a reoccuring library scan and not interrupt my 90%-quota for my mediaserver for example. Netlimiter solves this fantastically in every aspect in terms of my network but i cant seem to find a good solution regarding the disks.\n Any ideas or tips on how to do this?\n TLDR: How to set hard limit on .exe to use max 1MB/s write speed to disk regardless of disks maximum write speed?\n    submitted by    /u/Low_Wrangler5472  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m open to all ideas, OR if you think my setup is weird or unbalanced, I’d like some input to improve. Thanks for ideas in advance!!\n    submitted by    /u/Kn0t5  \n [link]   [comments]",

After failing at a few tutorials that turned out to be too outdated, I’ve got the hang of setting up basics of a K3s cluster.\n I tend to run into issues with cert managers, DNS etc. I’m currently running K3s + MetalLB + Traefik + Cert Manager. I’m currently trying to install Rancher (in order to have dashboard plus easy install of Longhorn for storage), but came to a stall when I have to “Set the hostname to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer” here. I’ve read good things about Tailscale as an alternative.\n In the end I want a cluster with home media capabilities (maybe Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr etc) available at my local IP or even better my_cool_ip.dev. Next step would be adding more apps like Bitwarden at my_cool_ip.dev/vault. I have a 3 node RPi cluster that I think I can do some cool stuff with if I can figure out ingress, certs, load balancing and IPs. Any tips would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/DoubleWhiskeyGinger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all. I currently have a Synology NAS and have enjoyed running a few apps such as Pi-Hole and BitWarden server using docker. I have been super impressed with how efficient these apps run. However, I am starting to bog down my Synology and would like to start using my Intel Mac mini for some contained apps. Its a high spec machine for being a Mac mini (i7, 16gb ram). I understand I could purchase another machine that runs solely linux, but for my current situation, I've got to use what I have currently.\n My issue is that I need something that is efficient but also not extraordinarily complicated. I am currently running a headless Windows 10 VM via parallels to run a Sonarr/QBit setup that has a PIA killswitch. But this is pretty inefficient and uses a bit more resource from the machine than it should for what I'm trying to accomplish. I have tried an Ubuntu VM, and the resource use is similar. I am also using the machine for Plex transcodes and it is a home machine for my family and I to use for basic schoolwork and web browsing tasks. I have read some on the Apple Hypervisor for VM's. But most of my research comes up with M1 forums which aren't helpful for my Intel machine. I am not opposed to using docker on the Mac, but most of what I've read says that it's super inefficient and not worth using. Maybe it's changed in recent, I'm not sure.\n Hoping someone that has some better knowledge about how container/VM apps work might be able to suggest something that would better fit my needs than what I have currently.

          "description": "Hope this is ok to post, but I could use some help. \n My home is 3 stories, and I want to set up a solid wireless network that is as hidden as possible (read: high WAF). I’ve got an Amplifi HD, but I’m not thrilled with the coverage and speed. \n I see locations where I can run Ethernet to all three floors, and would ideally like to use PoE AP’s so that I can hide AP’s in closets without running power, but am open to non PoE options. \n I imagine that ceiling mount throws coverage mostly down for one room, so would that not work with one AP per floor?\n I’m also seeing that some consumer mesh networks automatically adjust coverage to prevent crosstalk and am not sure if more enterprise / prosumer solutions rely on the installer to map coverage to prevent crosstalk?\n Finally, while I do have a technical background, I prefer not to tinker with tech at home (fully realize I may be asking in the wrong subreddit here, but am hoping you all may know of solutions).\n Any help and advice greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/johntarr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys!\n Before I start - I just want to say I didn't setup my homelab in the hopes of ever making money of it. I just recently thought it would be cool to repurpose some of my idle hardware to host some services for people, as a hobby / sidegig.\n ​\n Anyways, as the title suggests, do any of you generate revenue from your homelab? and if so, how? I wouldn't consider my current setup highend, and the majority of it consists of 12th gen dell and 8th gen HP servers. (Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&T's stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I'm (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. \n I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren't officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, or if there's better solutions for a side gig.\n    submitted by    /u/m70b1jr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was quite fluent on HP UX and whatever applications we used to use back in the day. Life happened and I went to the Dark Side and became a manager\n Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I'm kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)\n I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal\n I don't have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus\n Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant\n Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started.

Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM's or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. \n Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can't be the whole solution because it can't autocreate/allocate VM's for users and doesn't shutdown when not not in use. Doesn't help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can't auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically\n I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly.

          "description": "To clarify what I mean in the title: I need help deciding on the best method to use for remoting into my homelab/network from the outside.\n ​\n I've currently got three options I'm deciding between, and I'm not sure which one would be the best long-term. \n ​\n Option 1: I have a router that has VPN capability built in. I can set up the VPN on the route, download the OVPN client, put it on whatever device I will need to have access the home network, badabing badaboom.\n Option 2: Bastion host. I have a few spare devices I could turn into a bastion. Got a Lenovo T470 that isn't currently doing much, got a RaspberryPi 4 that isn't doing much, I could also spin up a VM on proxmox to act as a bastion.\n Option 3: Jump server. This one honestly seems a bit overkill and superfluous. The idea of hitting a machine then having to reauthenticate to another machine on my home network just sounds like a chore (I've also heard some people argue that in the modern cloud a bastion host is a type of jump server, I disagree, but I digress).\n ​\n So what I'm looking for is just to get some ideas about what others have done for their home network and how well it's been working from a security standpoint and a reliability standpoint.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ItzKale  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I just setup jellyfin on it and then I wondered if I could put a GPU inside the server. Hopefully this server already have x16 pci riser so I could put any gpu I wanted.

The only issue is I live in a small apartment and this Dell unit I bought is way nosier than I could've imagined. I explored immersion cooling and quite server cabinets (cuz I am a noise freak) but the price for both of these were quite hefty and opening a brand new dell storage to do DIY cooling in 4u is also not an option because it messes up with the warranty and same thing is almost true with immersion cooling as well.\n So, in the end, I found myself thinking more about different spaces in…",

Only problem is, I have no idea what to make of the connectors, since while I know that only two wires connect each socket (we have a similar system to BT's here in the walls, however it is wired differently, with the red wire at pin 3 and the blue wire at pin 4), I cannot seem to understand how to test points that have 4 wires connected (two at the top, two at the bottom).\n Of course, I have disconnected the home phone and the DSL (technically VDSL2, with support for at least profile 30a, perhaps profile 35b, although it only has a 100Mbps RJ-45 port) modem/wired router beforehand, and only reconnected them to post this.\n Here is a picture to illustrate what I mean: https://0x0.st/o49r.jpg (I cannot seem to upload to IMGUR with Sync for Reddit)\n I do plan to replace all of our BT sockets with RJ-11 sockets, just to make troubleshooting far easier, since most equipment cannot connect directly to BT for testing (I also need to test cables, after all), with LeGrand's modules making things easier for me there (I will be running both CAT5e for phone and CAT6A for networking, in preparation for my future homelab, after all), and for that I first need to ascertain what plugs where, especially since I need to move where the DSL modem/wired-router is physically connected.\n    submitted by    /u/moriel5  \n [link]   [comments]",

So my plan is as in the linked image at top:\n Internet into pfSense, then on into the Cisco (SFP port 1). SFP port 2 of the Cisco (SFP) will go into the Asus in WAP mode to handle the wifi traffic.\n This page ( https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-vlans-in-pfsense/ ) gives a decent overview of setting up VLANs to segregate traffic but it indicates I'll need to assign VLANs in the switch as well. I can do this but then it begs the question about wireless devices... \n I imagine the \"Trusted Systems\" VLAN devices will have access to each other, the internet, and my file server.\n IOT will have access to each other and pfSense NTP.\n Guest will have access only to the internet.\n Since wireless devices will all be coming into the Cisco through one SFP port, I can't just assign that port to one VLAN; if pfSense is handling DHCP, presumably I can use different subnets for the devices by individually assigning IPs.\n By default, new devices would be part of Guest until moved into Trusted or IOT... which is the gap in my current understanding. \n Thoughts? What am I missing here? Thanks in advance! I'm happy to learn by messing around but since I'll be taking down the entire home network to do this, hopefully it doesn't take too long. ;)\n    submitted by    /u/myfufu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was under the impression of the latter. \n anti tl;dr: I have two Intel X540s - one in my main PC (Windows 10), one in my server/NAS (Server 2022). Until today they were setup direct-attach. \n Large transfers of single files (> ~5GB) will start out saturating 10 GbE for a bit, drop to zero and hang, then pick back up. It'll repeat it a few times over the course of a transfer. \n On a 60GB mkv it happens about a half dozen times (all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it). Smaller files (< ~5GB) are a non-issue. \n I bought the NICs about two years ago and and tried to figure it out but couldn't and assumed it was a quirk of direct attach. \n Then I got a deal on a 10 GbE switch (Ubiquiti USW-Flex-XG) and set it up today. I made my X540s my primary NICs in each aaaaaaaand the problem is worse. I'm not even hitting 5 GbE, let alone 10 GbE. \n Here's iPerf3 - the result is the same in either direction.\n Here's an actual transfer - all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it. this is to/from an NVME but it happens with any combination of drives (SATA SSDs, RAID 0 HDD array, other NVME). \n The only thing I can come up with is maybe an overheating NIC? the X540 in my server has a 40mm fan strapped on it (because there's room). The X540 in my main PC doesn't have a fan because there's no room for it and the heatsink is lava. but I was under the impression the NIC would drop if it overheats?\n Windows, Intel ProSET, and Ubiquiti all show 10 GbE.

I know this question has been asked before but I still can't find an answer that solves the problem I'm having.\n I have 3 systems, 1st my day-to-day Windows desktop, 2nd my Windows 'cloud gaming' VM, and 3rd my TrueNAS system. My goal is to have all my games from Steam, Epic, Origin and GOG all installed to a Networked Drive/Folder that's stored on the TrueNAS system, which is then accessible to my 1st and 2nd system.\n Most guides suggest mapping my network drive as normal and installing the games there. This however causes permission issues, which can sometimes be solved by mapping in privileged mode and others, games won't even attempt to start.\n Another option which worked fine was mapping an iSCSI drive. However, this has the problem that only 1 system can access the drive (apparently you can have multiple, but it's highly discouraged?). It also seems it's only really good to set an allocated volume size, not just expand the until the drives get full. If I could do iSCSI, would this bypass the RAM and SSD cache I have for that pool?\n So my questions are, what should I do? and Is there an alternative I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/EthanCopping  \n [link]   [comments]",

As per the title, I was planning to build a small but relatively mighty NAS (mini-ITX, with Unraid) which is also going to be used as a web server, and one of the \"requirements\" are that it should ideally consume as less power as possible since it's going to stay on 24/7.\n Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:\n  \nTDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T\n frequencies, especially the base frequency\n  \nSo, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it's the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.\n So yeah I understand that the T-series under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.\n My concern is the following.\n When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? \n The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.\n Does this translate in less energy used by the T-series if compared to the non-T when both are subject to the same light load?\n Is this understanding correct, or am I missing anything?\n I'm asking here as there's plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.\n Any advice or insights is really appreciated.\n Thank you very much! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/matteventu  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's got everything from Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, ESXi, Proxmox, Docker, Ubiquiti, MySQL, and Synology, and in-house built apps. Most of the hardware consists of custom build workstations and servers. We have very little that runs in the Cloud. \n I've been a longtime lurker in /r/homelab.

I'm just at the point now where I need someone to take it over full time. \n The whole lab is accessed remotely by the staff and I need someone who can be there hands on to manage and document it all. Make sure things are backed up, fix/repair broken hardware, do reboots, upgrade/build new workstations as things age, install new software and keep things patched/secure and running. They also need to be organized enough to manage a large volume of data coming in and out of the office on a weekly basis.\n I've posted variations of this to a bunch of job sites and have gotten over 100 resumes to sift through. After a dozen phone screens, no one is coming even close. \n Most resumes are from people who are Tier 1 Helpdesk who do password resets, break fix, and some basic administration; but no one has ever installed anything from scratch. Only 1-2 people have ever built their own computer or know much about hardware, and no one seems to have any experience in Linux or Docker. Not a single resume has highlighted any Homelab experience.\n So, my question is:\n Where do you people look for jobs? Am I asking for too much?

While you can do this, pretty much any legitimate E-mail service out there will immediately flag anything you try sending as spam, or outright refuse to accept your messages in the first place.\n There's a lot of reasons you might want to be able to deliver arbitrary E-mails - not just to yourself, but to others, possibly across disparate E-mail domains. The vast majority of such messages need not ever be replied to, so even the E-mail address they come from is not necessarily that important, other than that it should be able to be identified by the recipient.\n Are there services out there that are generally trusted to be able to do this, even if for a modest cost? Basically I want to be able to have a reliable way to send both myself and others who are relevant various alerts and messages.\n Examples:\n  \nI want errors found on ZFS with zed to go to me and a friend,\n I want to design an app that can E-mail a small number of people when I post new content on my Jellyfin server\n I want to have a script send a daily report of some server stats to me.\n I want to have a Web app where a person with an account in my system can submit some kind of job, and when the job has finished an E-mail is sent to the account's stored E-mail address with the results of the job.\n  \nI know that if I were to just, say, create a Gmail account for the purpose, I could configure my apps to connect to Gmail's SMTP and deliver that way, but I'm not sure Google even allows this type of use in the TOS, and even if that's not a concern, it's likely not going to make you look very good when all your E-mail account is doing is sending out obviously auto-generated E-mails on a regular basis.\n How do you guys handle this?\n    submitted by    /u/fmillion  \n [link]   [comments]",

Been trying to read up on them online, but some information is scattered and inconsistent.\n  \nAre SAS hard drives worth it? From what I know internally they're the same as SATA drives and have a physical limit at around ~200 MB/s throughput.\n Why specify SAS' hard drive connections as 6G/12G if throughput is limited to ~200 MB/s anyways?\n SFF-8087 and SFF-8643 are apparently the same electronically, just another physical connector. Is there any difference and can I just use adapters to go from one to the other without performance loss?\n Is there any real world difference between SAS2 6G and SAS3 12G backplanes? From what I understand each SFF-8xxx cable running to the backplane will get one dedicated 6G/12G connection. So serving four drives each that would mean 1,5 Gbps throughput per drive when working with SAS2 6G, right?\n Aren't HBAs limited to 6G anyways? So why even bother with 12G backplanes?\n How do SAS expanders work and what's the performance? This Dell SAS expander seems to expand to 24 drives and connects to another server for JBOD via a single SFF-8088. Do I get 6G/12G for all 24 drives or what's the best way to connect a full array of hard drives without sacrificing performance?\n How do top loaders like 45Drives or Supermicro's 90 drive top loader serve all of the disks? Do they just have 22 HBAs? How do they ensure full performance?\n I assume SAS3 12G is relevant for faster flash storage – but why is it still relevant when everyone talking about NVMes for best performance nowadays?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Teilchen  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can't take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.\n I'd like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA.

          "description": "I am trying to figure out how to manage access for internal servers running various web apps. (It is important to note that neither these apps nor servers are exposed to the public Internet.) In the past, I have relied on unsigned certificates or even no certificates. However, I am starting to see apps that will not work in either of these configurations and web browsers that are becoming increasingly unhappy about unsigned certificates.\n I get that there are risks with unsigned certs, but these are tightly controlled apps inside my LAN and so I am less concerned. I am familiar with letsencrypt and use that for external facing apps. But all of these servers are internal only and so an external CA makes little sense.\n Any advice on how to handle this?\n TIA!\n    submitted by    /u/JL_678  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they're lower powered devices.

(Possibly also a BlueIris NVR)\n Pc’s are both running i7-4790’s and have 32GB of 1600Mhz DDR3. Both machines have 256gb of SATA SSD and 128GB of PCI SSD (dont ask about the PCI i dont know either) One also has a Quadro K4000 and the other a Quadro K4200\n Ive also got access to 6x 2TB WD Black Enterprise drives, with 4 being already installed in one machine and 2 sitting cold, as well as the odd 1TB HDD sitting as storage in the other machine\n I’ve and have played with Proxmox on these, but not sure if I have enough power to run or if its overkill for what I want to be doing - eg if TrueNAS will be sufficient\n Not sure how well Plex & BlueIris NVR will go on the hardware due to being virtualised and being on the older side. \n Would love some opinions! PFA of my dusty and cable mess of new projects! (don’t worry will be cleaned soon)\n    submitted by    /u/f0cusAU  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very thankful, and happy to say that some great enhancements have been made over the last 5 months.\n YT-RED v1.0.2.0 Beta is now available\n Included in the update is a major overhaul of the UI, reducing the original 2-tab design to a single tab (suggested by u/Kendjin) that supports downloads from Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo and more.\n Another neat feature included in the update is automatic ID3 tagging for audio downloads, including thumbnail images (requested by u/asifaqeel50)\n YT-RED is and will always remain Ad-Free and Completely Free to use with no tracking or data-collection, and public source-code on GitHub.\n For a full list of features and fine details\n View the YT-RED Project Page on github.io or check out the Beta Code in the Source Repository\n Please Note - YT-RED is not an open-source project While YT-RED source-code is made public and uses several open-source libraries and resources, I unfortunately cannot label it as \"open-source\" as it uses paid-license WinForms controls by DevExpress. While anybody is free to download the source code, it will not build without a valid DevExpress WinForms license.\n If anyone has read this disclaimer and still has an interest in contributing to the project, I'll be more than happy to work with you.\n Thank you all so much for your support earlier this year.

I'm running a jellyfin media server on my nas, and I can only seem to make it accessible on my home network, no matter what configuration changes I make, and at this point I'm out of ideas.\n I have a domain registered through Cloudflare pointing at my home IP address, a WebStation portal for that domain pointing to the correct port, and another one just for that port. It's accessible just fine on my home LAN, either through [hostname].local:[port] or through Synology QuickConnect, but if I try to connect through my domain, it just displays the standard \"Your website is not set up yet\" splash page that it usually shows when webstation isn't set up properly, and if I try to use QuickConnect, it just won't connect at all. I have port forwarding set up on my router for the relevant port, and I plan to eventually set up ssl for the jellyfin instance, but for now I just want it to connect at all.\n I don't have much experience with networking (I started and didn't finish a CS degree) and I'm frankly all out of ideas.

It's served me loyally, but I have a new remote work job, and it's time for an upgrade. I recently ordered a new Mac studio that will serve as my new mothership for work and all my personal/important files... but I still want to repurpose this old rig as a standalone plex server (and possible blue iris backup) since the hardware is still solid and the processor supports quicksync for hw transcoding (I'll probably upgrade the ram, psu, and move from sata cards to HBA, but i digress...) Here's my conundrum though.\n Part of me really wants to transition from this shameful jbod array with ~36TB of media to a more modern and manageable Unraid setup... however I'd have to ditch my cloud backup. B2 storage for this amount of stuff is prohibitively expensive for just a plex server. However, if I stay jbod on a standard desktop operating system (macos/windows/linux) I can keep all my data backed up on backblaze's desktop plan for 7 bucks a month. \n Do I really need a cloud backup for this media? There's nothing I couldn't probably find on usenet if I had a major failure. Am I overthinking this? \n Please help me see reason and figure out what to do. I've been going back and forth all week.

I was thinking keeping them, but calculating for storage, backup and stuff, recently I'm about changing my mind. If I purge my library from unusable stuff, I'll have around some thousand pics instead of the 40k I currently have (from most of which aren't good), and I wouldn't need to be concerned about storage and backup for a while (reducing my 2TB of images to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-200GB, which I can totally support with the current home and cloud infrastructure I use (inc. kept raw files).\n What do you guys think? \n If there are any photographers/videographers here, what do you do with kind of useless material?

I have multiple HDDs and an SSD, but today an HDD I've used for around 5-6yrs started getting disconnected from my laptop with high frequency. And it was abysmally slow, the last time I checked it could only do 5mbps write when data wasn't being read/written to it in the background.\n I knew that the HDD was in its last legs, but I procrastinated over getting a new one just because I was naive and new to hoarding data. I quickly ran over to a store and bought a new 2TB WD HDD. \n Now I've spent a few hours trying to switch my data, but it shows an estimated time to copy of about 20-45mins for a 500-700mb file. If I kept this pace, it'd take me like a week to transfer everything over, and doing a transfer like that freezes Finder even when I'm trying to move and browse through files even on my laptops on board SSD. I know that the bottleneck here is just the fact that my HDD is old AF and there's not much I can do except just move the files over a long period of time. But I came here looking for something that could help me in future if not now.\n Is there any way to make this painfully slow process even a bit more efficient and quicker? I'm currently using Finder's drag and drop copy paste feature.\n Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/GamingGamer182  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve watched YouTube tutorials and all that and I still can’t seem to find the “ELI5” tutorial I need to figure out what hardware and software I need. \n Has anyone on this sub done a very simple tutorial? I searched past threads and can’t find just a simple tutorial, mainly I just find threads troubleshooting issues I don’t understand yet because I haven’t gotten that far. \n Alternatively if anyone lives in Utah I will drive my collection to you and pay you to do this for me lol. Whatever you charge is probably worth it to me. I am very upset because I wasted tons of time entering all my digital codes on movies anywhere, iTunes, etc only to find out you can only download them for offline viewing for 90 days before you have to log in to verify you still own the device, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/kaylawright1992  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've tried every combination of setting in the book and I can't get it to work.\n My config is 2XSSD 2-column mirror + 7XHDD 5-column parity on Win10 for Workstations. It sets up the tiers properly but then only allows the HDD tier to be used at 50% efficiency. Looking at individual disk IO I can see that it's striping only two disks instead of 5. Something seems to be forcing the config into mirror-mirror instead of mirror-parity.\n Please note that I'm talking about Storage Spaces, not Storage Spaces Direct. I've scoured the MS documentation and the internet and can't find any reference to Storage Spaces not supporting mirror-accelerated parity but it's Microsoft so who knows? Even MS tech support can't find a definitive answer for me as to whether Win 10/11 supports this.\n Have any of you ever gotten this setup working and, if so, how the hell did you manage it?\n Thanks!\n P.S. - And, with all due respect, please don't just suggest that I dump Storage Spaces and use some other product.

Their colors, their shapes, and printed text on look just like Samsungs except they are.\n I tend to believe that something that is too cheap and offers too much for much less is probably somehow compromised in quality.

          "description": "First of all, apologies if this is not particularly the appropriate subreddit for this post. I figured it might be worth a shot given the nature of the situation.\n I'm trying to digitise a small handful of VHS tapes. My original plan was to plug my VCR into the Xbox One via an AV-HDMI adapter/upscaler, and then use OneCast to connect from my computer and just do a screen cap. The problem now is that Microsoft have locked down the OneGuide app that takes in HDMI input and doesn't allow apps like OneCast to stream from that app anymore (same with apps like YouTube etc.). Maybe somebody knows of a different app that can capture an Xbox stream?\n Short of buying a capture card, are there any ways around this? Having a device in front of me with HDMI in and out, plus a 2-way AV-HDMI adapter, plus a VCR and a computer is making me think there has to be a solution with what I have.\n Again, I know the most obvious solution is \"buy a capture card\". I'm just trying to work with what I have at the moment. And if I do end up needing to purchase one, what would be your (budget) suggestions?

Use tapes. To set the stage I am looking at this from a \"per-project\" standpoint not a \"backup my entire storage infra\" standpoint. \n I think would easily be able to fit a entire project (wedding, event, concert, etc...) on a single LTO-5 tape. With that I would double up and mirror the tapes and then just have them in a decent (but not great, admittedly) climate controlled environment for potential future access for up to 2-3 years after the project. So effectively I keep the \"good\" raw's and clips on my main storage array and then offload all of the project as a snapshot onto 2 identical tapes (original files, project files, and final exports).\n My goal is to reduce the spinning disks I need to maintain, decrease power usage, and decrese the space utilization of one off projects that I will likely never need to touch again, and still maintain that data for as long a possable for my own comfort and client good will. \n I am thinking I can find a LTO external SAS drive for ~$350, tapes for ~$9 per, and use something like bacula to manage the tapes.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/kd5vmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Th initial mirror back in the day was a big one, but all subsequent ones just update what's been changed.\n The issue I have is that the destination drive ends up with less available space than the source drive, even though they should be identical in size after the mirror.\n Currently, the source drive shows 276GB/5.45TB free, while the destination drive shows 178GB/5.45TB free.\n If I click into each drive and manually check all the file sizes, they come out identical, yet somehow the drive summary graph always shows higher usage on the destination drive.\n I have hidden files being shown, including protected OS files. I should note that both drives are separate from the OS drive, and only used to store media files.\n I don't have any compressed files on either drive. Both drives have a cluster size of 4096 Bytes, with 512 Bytes per sector.\n I'm just stuck scratching my head as to why the drives show different file sizes.

These drives are all less than one-year old. \n Several of drives have had same issue over the past few months: slow initialization/mounting and slow transfer time (around 10/mbps). I have seemingly tried all I can think of to isolate the issue: tried different Macs, different formats (APFS and Mac OS Extended), different cables, etc. Sometimes it improves, but then reverts back to being slow. The interesting thing is that I tried WD’s 2 TB models and have not had these problems. \n I running Mac OS Catalina on a late 2013 iMac and a M1 MacBook (2020) running Monterey. The source drive is a Samsung T7 2TB SSD. The targets/backups are WD 5 TB Elements USB 3.0. For backup software, I use Carbon Copy Cloner. \n Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated.

          "description": "Hello,\n I have never archived any data before, and I think it's time to sort out my mess of hard drives before it's too late. \n I'm looking at archiving my photos, videos and university work to optical media. I'm unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.\n I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.\n The data I'm storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.\n I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it's worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.\n I'd appreciate any feedback on this topic. \n Many thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/carrot0202  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking to control around 20 SATA CD/DVD ROM drives, so port density and cost become important. Is anyone aware of similar boards - I really liked that the HPM-XU used a USB-B connector instead of the MicroUSB.\n I'm putting all of this into a dedicated enclosure, which will connect via USB to a PC or laptop. I'm specifically looking for solutions that do not require a host computer/bus (other than USB) but do have power within my enclosure to power drives and cards like the U3-QS3.\n FWIW - Most off the shelf cheap USB3 -> SATA cables appear to not support ATAPI.\n I'm not interested in building a dedicated computer to do this - I want a USB3 interface I can move around, and plug into multiple devices w/out having to bring anything else with me.\n    submitted by    /u/AudioHamsa  \n [link]   [comments]",

My telecine files for that 2.5 minute reel are typically about 85GB (6.5k resolution, HDR). As one does with analog film, long term preservation of the film itself and the original telecine files is important. I'm looking to burn these video files to BDXL MDISC and keep them offsite, to help support the 3-2-1 rule.\n Question: What is the best type of marker to use when labeling discs for long term archival storage? I know Sharpies are a no-no because they fade with time, but how about something like a Sakura Pigma Micron Pen, since they claim to be pigment based and archival in nature. Is something like that chemically safe to use with the MDISC without threat of damaging the disc over a long period of time?\n What do you recommend one uses?\n    submitted by    /u/Provia100F  \n [link]   [comments]",

I still want albums to be sorted into their own folder each.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/IAmDarcula  \n [link]   [comments]",

I plan on adding 2 more 8tb drives in the near future. My use case for this will be a Plex server with a few Docker containers and a small SMB share. Unraid seems to be a great option, with the ability to expand your pools later on. While TrueNAS has ZFS and you don't have to have a USB as a critical part of your system. The downside is I would not be able to add the drives to a ZFS pool when I purchase them down the line. I really like the idea of using Unraid but the USB thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about it. I've read some comparison articles but none of them have been able to sway me in either direction. I appreciate any help you can offer or guidance towards the correct decision.\n    submitted by    /u/reactivesayswhat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Discord has replaced forums as a platform for exchanging information on specific topics. These forums are fortunately largely covered by e.g. the Wayback-Machine. The problem is that Discord is quite closed and can't be easily archived.\n ​\n How can the whole thing be done?\n Me and a friend have thought about something. We have developed a website and a discord bot. Every server admin can index his server with the bot. On Search-Cord.com you can search all messages in a few milliseconds. The usernames no longer contain #tags so that no users can be contacted against their will.\n The current state:\n Currently we have about 20 servers with a total of about 3 million messages archived?\n ​\n What about opensource?\n The complete source code can be found on Github.\n What if someone does not want their messages to be in the archive?\n On the website you can autentify yourself with discord and then delete all messages from the archive and put yourself on a blacklist to prevent future messages from being archived.\n    submitted by    /u/calvinwaran  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My father was a big time record collector. He would literally skip meals for most of a week to have cash to buy a new vinyl record, as my mother tells it. He passed about 15 years ago, so his collection has sat dormant for awite awhile. One of his last gifts he got was a USB turntable. My brother doesn't want the records and I don't have the physical space. It seems that growing this collection was kind of his life mission. He would refer to anything non vinyl as \"Inferior music.\"\n My goal for now is to get his USB turntable, and rip every single album, so my brother and I can have our own little piece of the music my father sacrificed so much to afford. This will be a nightmare project. I ballpark at least 100 albums, and I'd be thoroughly unsurprised if it was closer to 200, and at a very conservative 30 minutes, that's 50 hours of ripping, at minimum. If I do this, I want to do this ONCE. I replace my hard drives every 4 years, and I know USB drives and SD/Micro SD are famous for short lifespans, so I'm looking for something we could keep for as long as possible. I'm not looking for huge storage capacity. Ripping direct WAV files, this should easily take up less than a TB. I want to be certain we could play these for as long as possible though. My brother isn't into music, and the music he is into he'll just go to YouTube for. I have no doubt he'll take the thing storing the music, throw it in a safe, and it'll never see the light of day again. Another reason that having a long term format is very important. It's going to sit there for a very, very long time.\n I'm considering Blu Ray-R discs, but there's probably something better for this task. I also don't have a Blu Ray drive, so that would add minimum $100 to the project. To those who are more informed about storage than me, any advice? What would you do in my shoes? Thanks to anyone who can help me\n    submitted by    /u/Breude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have access to good office printers, so scanning most of the standard documents was a breeze. But I'm having issues with larger format documents. Especially paper rolls (so about 3-4m x 80cm wide), but also larger DIN A0 documents (e.g. Blueprints, plans, family trees, posters, etc.). I checked local services, but they can only handle DIN formats, but not the rolls. Do you guys have any ideas on how I could digitize them in somewhat good quality? I was thinking of taking lots of photos and stitching them with photomerge in Photoshop, but that failed quite badly. Are there maybe some scanner apps specialized for this, or are there any other techniques than I'm missing? Thanks for any help in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/corny96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I do regular backups of all of my devices, cards, and external drives, which a lot of the times includes tens of gigabytes of video footage (I do freelance videography work). I know I could most likely just delete all this footage after but as data hoarders understand, we would rather have a thorough archive of what we've shot, even if we'll never use the footage again.\n I've recently started using Handbrake to compress some of my archived footage which has been great - I have projects that had over 100GB of video footage in them and compressing the video files has literally halved the amount of storage space needed for those files. The only downside is, the compressed files are brand new files and the old still exist. So the only way I can actually benefit from this system is if I delete the old files, which I'm hesitant to do since those original files have all the \"created at\", \"modified at\", and other data associated with the actual original creation.\n What I'd love to be able to do is use some kind of tool or process to be able to delete these files but automatically replace them with a little data file that contains all that info. That way if I go looking for the files someday in the future and I navigate to the directory I know they should be in, I can see the files that were there plus all the original data from them, but it's just like a .txt file or something like that but which has the same name as the original file (different extension though obviously).\n Is anyone aware of something that does this or a workflow I could use to do it manually but in bulk? Any thoughts anyone has would be greatly appreciated! Cheers \n EDIT: Forgot to mention, I have both MacOS and Windows machines but usually my backup processes take place on Windows so looking for preferably a tool/process for Windows, but can make Mac work as well.\n    submitted by    /u/DoctorVanNostrandMD  \n [link]   [comments]",

They're still available to view on BFI but are all now (and newer ones) currently inaccessible to download (brightcove cdn, not figured out how to get at it yet)\n ​\n It's on DHT but I'm the only seeder and slow upload (~400KB/s) I just noticed some leechers on my Tixati client a while ago so looks like the meta got picked up.\n ​\n Can anyone help seed? You can view/find it here:\n ​\n https://bt4g.org/magnet/57e5b1aee0d46a0c6983ec62f2b6fa7b368d174f\n ​\n It will be a slow burn; I calculated at my upload speed it would take about 2 months to upload the lot.\n    submitted by    /u/aPir8  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I am new to this subreddit and it looks like there is a lot of info about that which has been concerning me a lot recently.\n At one point I started to use OneDrive to sync some files that I don’t want to risk losing if either my laptop computer or my desktop craps out on me. In retrospect I think this was a bad idea as OneDrive did something I didn’t want it to do and gave me extra work.\n I selected to backup three areas which it insists the user keep synced to their cloud service which are desktop, documents, and pictures folders.\n I naively thought that when I select sync for desktop of one and of desktop on another computer that the files would be in the cloud separately attributed to the different computers. Instead it threw everything together on both desktop. I of course don’t need shortcuts to programs that are only installed on one to appear on the desktop of another computer. \n Now if I keep the option to “sync” on on both of them, if I delete the shortcut on the wrong computer, it disappears from the other computer.\n Can anyone suggest a solution to bring it back to normal. I assume there is no function to “revert the sync” in OneDrive, so it seems I have to turn the sync off for both computers then sort out the files, then never to turn again.\n If anyone can give me any help and instructions how to do this or maybe how to keep the desktops backed up without something like this fiasco happening, please let me know.\n    submitted by    /u/SlothChunks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm aware of the risks with RAID 0 (i.e. no redundancy and an increased risk of failure), but sadly I don't have budget for another drive to add as a spare. I am nearing the end of the free space on this array, so a new drive will likely be required in the next ~6 months. I'll have to make budget for this, as this is more a priority than adding a spare -- or multiple -- (unused) drive(s).

Any different way of using it proceeding with the drives is okay with me, open for any suggestions. \n The case if anyone is interested is \n Corsair Graphite Series™ 600T Mesh Mid-Tower Case from like 10 years ago.\n    submitted by    /u/xelu01  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does that sound right for a Seagate Ironwolf and a couple of dissimilarly-sized WD Reds? The Seagate spec sheets only list the 12V peak load and I'm unclear if I'm reading it correctly that the WD spec sheets are trying to communicate that the 12V and 5V rails have the same potential peak load.\n If at all possible, I'd also like to leave enough slack to swap in my brother's old GeForce GTX760 if my GTX750 dies before I'm ready to buy a new PC to swap my drives into.\n Can anyone provide clarity on the spec sheet side of things and is there a more suitable PSU calculator you would recommend?\n ...and if I am too close to the edge to pick up an Ironwolf Pro and a Red Pro on sale and a 2-port PCIe SATA card, would you advise a replacement PSU or can anyone suggest a trustworthy DC-DC voltage converter to supply them that shouldn't be too expensive to get a hold of in Canada?

Fired up the old 6-core AMD (it doesn't have AES support in the CPU) that I used to use as a daily driver - not expecting much. Fully expected the drives to be a loss.\n Won't boot. No signal on monitor... Hmm\n Figured out it was a RAM issue and now down to 8GB (2x4GB sticks.) Boots OK.\n Fire up old antix-16, ZFS is waaay back on 0.6.9-5 and the DE is fluxbox. LOL I was barebones back then, all the RAM went to ZFS and VMs.\n ​\n Fast forward, fast forward. Backed up my root filesystem, apt-get upgrade and Debian jessie is now at the latest package versions.\n ​\n Upgraded zfs from source to 0.8.6 and ran a scrub on both mirror pools. \n 0% damage, nothing to repair. \n SMART long tests passed on all drives tested so far.\n ​\n Now I normally would not recommend doing this, #1 you will screw yourself out of disk warranty - and normally I would spin things up every 1.5 years or so - but I plain did not have the space. Was able to recover some missing spreadsheet files from my old /home and will be using the disks till they die, it's a spare system at this point and will probably be off most of the time except for some nights and weekends.\n ​\n Just wanted to post a ZFS success story. Didn't have to make hashes or anything, ZFS handles it all internally. If you have some backup data that will be sitting for a while, put it on ZFS mirrors - it might last 3.5 - 4 years!\n    submitted by    /u/zfsbest  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, today I bought WD Purple 4TB (WD42PURZ), a CMR drive with 256MB cache according to specs from WD. But I noticed this drive has trimming option for some reason. Trim on HDD's are used on SMR drives as far as I know. I've been writing random files of more than 1TB to the disk but it didn't slow down at all, it can't be an SMR drive. But when I researched, I didn't find anything related to trimming on CMR drives. I will share the datasheet from WD and a screenshot from CrystalDiskInfo:\n ​\n https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/product/internal-drives/wd-purple-hdd/product-brief-wd-purple-hdd.pdf\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/9fkhl6t2h7t91.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e61c0ee0f452b33f506cb6a391a9bde8b4bcc72\n Also this drive has 5040RPM compared to 5400RPM of WD40PURZ. Older PURZ models first came out in 2017, these newer ones with higher caches came out earlier this year. So does anyone know what's the deal with these newer Purple models and why they have trim option?\n    submitted by    /u/DarkOrion11  \n [link]   [comments]",

Some folders literally just have 3 or 4 of the same song in there named slightly different things. Other folders have a nice tidy set of albums complete with meta data.

He's really keen to not lose any of this as some of them are rare tracks he's collected over the years.\n \nTransfer onto a drive that he can access while away from home.

Now this has actually happened before and the controller tends to just flag the drives as Dead, as a precaution and I’ve always been able to force them to clear that status and just try again with a command line version of their utility, but this time that’s not working. The controller keeps returning an error saying it’s subsystem is locked, and it won’t respond to a SU level unlock command either. Wondering if anyone has had the same thing happen and if they managed to mount the array any other way? I’d even toss the drives in a PC tower with enough bays if there was a prescribed method for accessing a Promise array another way. \n Just evaluating options before I give the astronomical quote from the recovery company to my management lol! \n Oh and it was a six drive array in Raid5 and FOUR of the damn disks are affected.

My files are mostly movies and TV but I will backup more or less everything on it. I already have some redundant backup in the form of a 10tb and a 4tb.\n If I get the non pro ironwolf 5x 8TB it will cost me $925. Or $23 per TB. It also leaves me no empty bays. \n But if I get the Exos 16TB drives it will give me the same level of storage if I only get 3. Which will cost me $840 or $17.5 per TB. Which still leaves me 2 bays for expansion. \n All of these will leave me with 32TB of storage in a raid 5 setup. But everywhere I look it seems to suggest that the ironwolf is the cheaper solution and the exos is even more expensive than the pro ironwolfs. Which would still even cost me $60 more to get the 16TB pro Ironwolfs. \n So why is Exos listed as the more expensive and objectively better tier when it appears to be cheaper overall. Sure I won't get the same speeds as running 5 bays but eventually I could. \n Unless I am missing something here. \n Any input would be great. Also. I havent decided on a 5 bay enclosure yet.

I'm trying to gain a better understanding of those of you who use a cloud service to hoard, whether you have been grandfathered into an unlimited storage deal or not. \n 1) Wouldn't it be more practical to use an on-prem storage solution? I feel like the cost of a cloud service would eventually hit the point to where simply buying your own storage would become more economical. \n 2) Do you still feel you are in complete control and own your data? It's hard for me to imagine trusting someone else to maintain all of my data for me. \n 3) I am currently visiting outside of the US (my home country) and I use a Synology 1821+ to house about 70TBs of my data. The upload/download times are terrible. How long does it take you to upload or bring your data back down? I understand your internet service will play a large part in this, but it seems like it would take a long time to upload a single 4k REMUX that is >50GB. \n 4) How often are you accessing the data?

After a ton of research I ended up purchasing an mLogic mTape Thunderbolt 2 LTO-6 Ultrium External Tape Drive. This was especially attractive at the time because the Thunderbolt 2 interface promised speed and it worked with my Mac.\n After purchase I filled a total of 14 x 2.5 TB tapes.\n Project finished a few years later. Fortunately I was able to complete all my work without any mishaps.\n A few weeks ago, though, I decided to review my tapes to see if I still needed all of that data.\n 4 of the 14 tapes (28%) are unreadable.\n As I said, my work on this project was completed a long time ago and, thankfully, this data is no longer essential.\n However, the experience has left me wondering:\n Is this a typical failure rate for LTO tapes (all high-quality FujiFilm LTO Ultrium 6 Data Cartridges)\n  \n I can’t imagine this IS typical - since everything I’ve read about tape backup touts it as the most reliable of all backup systems - but assuming it is, what other possible explanations could account for the failures?\n  Is there anything that can be done to salvage the failed tapes?\n  \nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

          "description": "I've had a 4 disk ZFS raid 10 setup for over 8 years that has been rock solid... 30TB usable storage that's mostly movies/tv shows and more recently I have begun to consider switching my implementation towards reducing power consumption (disk spun up time) since anyone accessing a single plex for 1 or 2 media streams cause all of my 4 disks to be active all the time. \n UNRAID seems like a good compromise that could help by only keeping the disks with the actual file stored in use that need to be while keeping a parity disk (which seems like it would only be able to tolerate a single disk failure at a time; two data disks failing at once in the array seems like it would be catastrophic for unraid). \n I'm wondering if anyone has any horror stories or advice to share about this? ZFS has been very very good to me over the years. There is no doubt that I could keep things the same but after awhile it seems like I could be able to use storage tiering (dedicated cache, merged filesystem) with UNRAID plus reducing power consumption by turning down the 24/7 four disk array active most of the time due to some minor I/O activity.\n My workload is primarily Plex media server, NFS/SMB. Going to UNRAID for everything could work; but I could also do a unraid hybrid setup with 2 disks ZFS mirror for my documents and photos while leaving the movies+tv files in other disks (this would increase my hdd count from 4 to 5 though due to parity needs)... a third option (probably very time consuming) is openmediavault + https://github.com/45Drives/autotier + ZFS (on each disk, simply to get the ability to 'zfs send/receive' to backup to another zfs server nightly)\n    submitted by    /u/Intelg  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then make a script so that I can plug in the second drive and it will automatically copy everything to it. It sends an email notification when done (so I know when I can disconnect the drive). The drive will be stored offline at my friend's house, so I have to go there and pick it up and bring it back everytime (which is fine for me, I come there regularly).\n To copy everything I'm probably going to use rsync with the -b flag (=incremental backups). One folder containing all the up-to date files. If a file has changed it will move the old file to a folder with the current date as name and update the file in the \"up-to date folder\" with the new contents. Same for deleting (moving to the current date folder).\n So before running the script:  /backup/files/test content: test1 \n Then change test1 to test2\n After running the script: ``` /backup/2022-10-08/test content: test1\n /backup/files/test content: test2 ```\n Do you have any tips/recommendations?\n Also, should I include cloud storage in my backup plan?

My fiance and I want to step up our game. Right now we share our flat with two friends and have little space and no LAN ports or bandwidth to spare. Seriously. Our network topology could only be worse if we managed to jam a loop in there.\n So, we made a plan. And I'd very much appreciate if you could look it over real quick and give some feedback:\n  \nBuy a couple identical NAS drives and chuck them in external USB cases for now to save space. Subscribe to Backblaze for a cloud backup solution that I won't have to sell my first-born for once the wild hoarding ride goes into overdrive.\n Hoard data separate from one another for now to leave our LAN in its current miserable state.\n Once we move, buy another two NAS drives identical to the ones already present and put them in an actualy NAS system in RAID 1.\n Copy our data to the NAS, wipe the external drives and put them in the NAS.\n  \nAdditionally, pray to bit almighty that our temporary solution doesn't implode.

This may be a long post.\n First off, I have a range of undeveloped film (35mm, APS, 110, a few old disposables and even a couple of film disks), as well as negatives and slides (Kodachrome).\n MY questions: The general consensus seems to be that the Plustek 8100 and Epson v600 Photo are the minimum requirement for current gen to achieve decent results, my question here is whether this is still accurate as a lot of the information seems to be from many years ago?\n I have looked through a lot of the standalone and flatbed options, and most seem to be 35mm only, however this seems to only be a limitation of the included mounts, with aftermarket mounts available for the likes of the Plustek standalone and Epson flatbeds. I guess I really just wanted to confirm that this is the case, and I am not missing something?\n It also seems that if this is the case, it should be relatively easy to rig something up for film where it would not warrant the cost of buying an adapter, even if only able to scan one image at a time. I cannot seem to find much information on people actually doing this though, so it may not be viable in practice?\n Well, I guess not as many questions as I thought... I suppose I really just want to find some confirmation from those who know about these things that picking up one of the above scanners is what I need. After I have the scans, I am much more confident with digital manipulation in PS/GIMP than I am with getting them digitized in the first place, and I know whatever way I go at this, it is a long-term project.\n Appreciate any input or suggestions!\n ​\n Cheers,\n ​\n A.\n    submitted by    /u/Ana_Dec  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I need help managing over 50,000 photographs. How can I easily go through them?\n My setup: I have a 10Tb external drive I use as a backup. The files are all in the root folder, sorted by Date Taken. (Maybe the photos should not be in the root so that my drive can open before it starts loading them?) The computer I have is over 10 years old with an AMD APU, and it seems to struggle with loading them all. I was given an older SSD which has increased the speed of Windows significantly. I am not at the PC now, but likely have 16Gb of DDR3.\n Is the bottleneck coming from my processor, or possibly the RAM? My mission is to compile all my photos of my cat, and to also get the photos of all the other animals we have had around our home. Viewing large thumbnails would be preferred but due to the quantity of photos it is a very laborious process. I also don't want to stress the external drive too much. (There's not AI that can identify animal photos is there?)\n ​\n Additionally, I am wondering if there is a way to 'label' each photo, i.e. this photo contains photos of my garden and contains a searchable tag of 'garden' or my cat 'lily', or 'wedding', 'raccoons', 'basement', etc.\n If anyone has any ideas I would be interested in hearing them.

My plan is to refresh the data on these every 6 months from my working data (local nextcloud server). If I do this, do I need to bother checking the quality of the data to make sure no data has been lost/corrupted? Would best practice to be completely re-write the data to the drives as opposed to updating only deltas to assure no data is lost? Sorry if that is a super basic question. \n Finally, are there any recommendations for external HDDs to look at? Seems to be a ton of options and its hard to pin-point what is best for my use case.

By the time the day was over, if you wanted to revisit this obscure story, you'd have to dig up an ancient Facebook meme page. At least until it got an animated adaptation. \n You can check out my reupload of Doge Noir here. \n Is this worth archiving? Well, the whole thing is a whopping 7MB, so I'm not exactly straining their data centers with this. I thought it was pretty entertaining. The ending was funny. Doge is my favorite meme, so maybe I'm biased. \n SEAMUS O'CONNOR\n    submitted by    /u/Brancliff  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did have to buy some DDR4 for the openwrt board and the case, but the rest are odds & ends from other projects. \n Frankenstein has a 150W 12v psu, a 100W pico ATX psu (just for the control board) and two 12v to 5v DC-DC converters for the SSDs and HDDs. If it's plugged in and the main switch is on, the SSDs have +5v power regardless of the motherboard state so firmware is free to do whatever it does offline. The second switch is for powering the two HDDs and a small fan for the HDDs. Sans HDs, it's whisper quiet.\n The control board is an N6005 at 3.2Ghz, 32GB RAM, 11 SATA ports, one nvme and 4 2.5gbe ports.\n Power is ~21W idle for control board + SSDs, ~32W idle for everything.

For example, I will create a brand new Instagram account on an IP I've never used before (in this case, it was at a library). I will then plug in those credentials to my script and run it.\n Once that happens, it usually comes back right away with a `challenge_required` message.\n So I go to the account, login, do the \"challenge\" (usually a code that is sent to the email affiliated with the account. The email being used is tied to an email address that has never been used on Instagram) and once I enter the code, it usually suspends me right away.\n How does it know? I'm doing all of this on a fresh IP that I've never used before, on an Instagram that I've never used before, which is tied to an email that I've never used.\n Is there a way around this? Is there a \"cleaner\" way I could do this without them sniffing out the account so quickly?\n What's funny is that when I run the script using my normal, person Instagram that I've had for years, it normally doesn't suspend it. It might ask me to enter a 2FA code, but that's it. I'll then re-run it and it works.

          "description": "So before we get started here, I just want to point out that I'm only using these SMR drives in environments where self-powered, small footprint drives, for less than the cost of 4TB SSDs are required. Once they've been written to, they're only ever read from thereafter.\n Write performance is obviously the problem I'm running into. It's particularly frustrating building multiple drives. What usually happens is that everything starts out fine, around 90 MB/s but eventually performance falls through the floor once they begin filling up. Writing files at this point gets REALLY slow.. 100 KB/s - 10 MB/s.\n I've seen others mention doing a DD Write of an entire drive to get around the SMRs internal micromanaging. Is it possible to create a 5TB image that I can mount and modify from a larger drive, then DD Write that image to the SMR drive when it's ready? I need to use ext2 partition for my application if that makes a difference.\n    submitted by    /u/s1mbin  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, which encryption method and/or software should I use the keep the data in the Z-Pools and storage medium secure from unauthorized access, that is brute force resistant?\n  \nSorry if I'm asking a lot or if my questions may be dumb of me to ask, but I know that I know very little and mostly select info, so I want to differ to more knowledgable individuals than I so that I can get this right the first time.

          "description": "My wife had a corrupted SD card, and I feel partly responsible for the loss because I had not previously set up a household data management system. Her 256 GB laptop has been sitting at 99% full for months. I decided it was time to make a change. \n I recently built a new office PC for myself, which left an empty tower (HAF 912, 8GB ram, z77 extreme4 mobo with 8 sata ports) sitting around. I ordered five WD red+ 4TB drives for $70/each, and a new 200 mm Noctua case fan for the front of my HAF 912 to blow over the drives. \n I wasn't sure whether I would be able to pull it off, but installing TrueNAS, setting up the pool, users, groups, permissions, etc. was all straightforward with the help of youtube. Useful volume is 10.9 TB, set up in Raid Z2. Performance is reasonable - around 90 MB/s over my wireless LAN bridge. For an \"all-in\" price of ~$400, I'm quite happy with the system. \n I set up gmail alerts, weekly SMART tests, bi-monthly scrubs, and I have everything set to back up to BackBlaze B2 weekly. \n Everything seems to be going.... too well. Is this really all that I need to do? I was considering doing some failure testing, i.e. unplugging a drive, and seeing how TrueNAS notifies me. Or unplugging two drives, and trying to manually run a BackBlaze backup to see if it will fail. \n Big shout-out to the content creators and community for the helpful guides on pulling this off.\n    submitted by    /u/redoran  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am rapidly outrunning my current storage solution, and will have to build something new very soon. I am looking to build a system to serve primarily as a NAS, but also to handle some other services, so that I don't have to keep my desktop running day and night.\n My general requirements for the system are:\n + It should be able to run the operating system of my choice\n - This eliminates most pre-built NAS solutions (Synology, Drobo, etc.)\n + It should support at least 5 drives (I want to run 5x 8TB drives in either RAIDZ1 or RAIDZ2) + It should be expandable in future\n + It should consume as little power as possible\n The solution that I have come up with is to use a mini PC connected to a hard drive enclosure. The mini PC would run the NAS software and run ZFS on the connected drives. + The mini PC: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PBK35VD + The drive enclosure: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y4F5SCK + The drives: 5x https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQX27GM\n Does this solution make sense, or have I made a mistake somewhere?\n    submitted by    /u/supereater14  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Alright so I'm sure this topic has been discussed countless times, yet from my searching a few things still aren't clear to me, and I'm sure this same confusion exists for others as well.\n First, let me briefly establish what I do know. According to the internet, greedy companies have got copyright laws in the weird position where backing up your physical discs is legal in concept but not in practice, because you're not allowed to break the encryption on the blu-ray discs.\n Most people ripping blu-rays out there seem to be trying to break this encryption so they can make the blu-rays \"DRM free\" and save it as a regular file. I hate DRM as much as the next guy, but my primary purpose is to digitize my blu-rays for convenience of use and safety from natural disasters.\n So my thought is simple: Why not just avoid breaking the encryption? Is there some technical reason why you can simply copy the data on a blu-ray as-is into an ISO or something and just load that up digitally on the drive (like inserting the disc) whenever you want to watch it? Or is that not how it works? I don't understand how an encryption technique could prevent you from simply copying the data as-is into an ISO and then just treat it like a \"regular\" blu-ray disc?\n And if you can do this, then doesn't it partially negate the whole purpose of the encryption anyways? I mean, it isn't like someone couldn't just copy an ISO file just like any other regular video file.\n Can someone clear up why \"breaking the encryption\" seems to be so unavoidable?\n    submitted by    /u/-AdmiralSnackbar-  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since I know some of you use some sort of Sata controller (probably either in a x1 or the x16 (4x) slot), how many would still upgrade, if you had to use the controller in the 2nd x16 slot (thus both now run at 8/8).\n    submitted by    /u/themayor1975  \n [link]   [comments]",

Their cards don't fail on me often, but a couple times now, it's happened. The first instance, my MicroSD card was replaced with another unit of the one that failed, as expected. But this recent failure was a 200GB card, and I guess they didn't have any more 200GB cards laying around, because they sent me a 400GB card to replace it.

However, the free version does not support versioning and the license for the paid version is valid only for the version that you paid for. Currently they are in V10 and I'm not sure when they will update to V11. I'm worried that if I pay for V10, they will update to V11 very quickly, then I have to pay again. \n For cloud backup, I currently don't have any. I do have a Nextcloud server set up and is using the Nextcloud software to sync certain folders/files.\n I'm trying to see if there are better alternatives, free or paid. If free, I need versioning as my critical files are changing everyday and I schedule daily backups for those files & folders. If paid, is there a better licensing method compared to Syncback?\n My requirements are as follows:\n 1) Local backups and Nextcloud server backups\n 2) Able to choose which folders/files to backup for Nextcloud separately from local backups\n 3) Versioning\n 4) Incremental Backup\n 5) Scheduling\n 6) File integrity check\n 7) Need to be able to restore individual files\n 8) I'm not sure if I need image backups as sometimes I like to wipe my computer clean and reinstall only the software that I really need at that time.

ZFS sounds interesting and I really want to learn it, but I don’t know if ZFS is recommendable for my small setup, plus, my RAM is 12GB and non-ECC . I’ve also read about some filesystems that would cause problems if you run out of space, I want to avoid them.\n The ability to access the FS on Windows is good, but not completely necessary. WinBTRFS doesn’t seem to be 100% reliable to not corrupt the data on Windows… but not sure.\n So what filesystem do you recommend to me? What encryption scheme is recommended? I’ve heard that some filesystems have builtin encryption. I assume, first I have to create an encrypted filesystem on the two other HDDs and copy the files to them. Then I should wipe the external HDD, and create a filesystem on it and copy the files back.\n Your help would be much appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/imsosappy  \n [link]   [comments]",

As per the title, I was planning to build a small but mighty NAS (mini-ITX) which is also going to he used as a web server, and one of the \"requirements\" are that jt should ideally consume as less power as possible since it's going to stay on 24/7.\n Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:\n  \nTDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T\n frequencies, including the base frequency\n  \nSo, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it's the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.\n So yea I understand that the T under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.\n My concern is the following.\n When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? \n The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.\n Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something?\n I'm asking here as there's plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.\n Any advice or insights is very much appreciated.\n Thanks a lot! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/matteventu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have a Supermicro Unraid setup with 130TBs of storage that I use primarily for Plex and personal video storage and I need your help.\n I started a pretty decent non-prof sports photography/videography business and am in need of a big time storage solution for long-term archival and some everyday usage. I wanted to build this out more \"officially\" and efficiently than my little at-home setup so I figured I would ask for some advice here. I'm also willing to \"hire\" someone (just out of my own pocket) if there was someone out there that could help me design and put a build together. \n So my use case, here is what I am looking to do:\n  \nHave long-term storage for photos and primarily video of Las Vegas High School sports (we are starting with boys and girls basketball this year)\n Being able to store game film from every high school game each season and archive that footage for 10-20 years.\n Have a storage solution that will allow multiple video editors and contributors to edit video (premiere and final cut) from different storage areas directly (will have 5 Mac Studio computers located locally within the same office at the servers, so could do 10GBE runs, etc).\n  \nBased on the personal storage I have been using for the last 6 months of filming myself I can see how this is going to scale at a massive level and put me in what I would consider the \"DataHoarder\" zone!

Best example: we had a scanner classroom with a dozen different scanners for digitalizing film photography and such. People often didn't delete the stuff from the computers after they were done and I collected them. \n Now I want to start an art project with all these collected files, but I'm not sure if this is allowed. I know from some of them who it was, but most of the time people didn't really add names to their files. I probably can ask the ones that did add their name for permission. But is that even necessary?\n It was stored on public computers, there were no rules about the usage of it all. \n I also recall artist Sherrie Levine who blatantly copied work of great artists such as Evan Walker, Edgar Degas and Marcel Duchamp. Without asking their permission of course. \n This might be the wrong sub to ask this, but someone might be able to help me out here.\n    submitted by    /u/Krullenbos  \n [link]   [comments]",

One has higher RPM but lower read and write speed, plus smaller cache. The other drive is the opposite - lower RPM with higher read and write speed and bigger cache. Also, the first drive is a little heavier. Does anybody know what's up with that?\n Drive 1: here \n Drive 2: here\n    submitted by    /u/MediocrePlague  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would really prefer not having to find a workaround for this.\n My question is, do PCIe x4 SAS HBA cards with the external ports exist? The LTO-5 drive I am looking to buy is a dual SAS one, so I assume I need one that has 2 external ports? I think that's the kind of card I need, anyway.

Of course I have adopted the hoarding ways and now starting to feel the limits.\n I bought a motherboard with a decent number of SATA ports and expanded it with a SAS controller (seemed like a pretty niche piece of hardware!).\n What are my options for further expansion? I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.\n Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this? When I look it up I find a bunch of synology expansions arrays.\n Sorry if this is a silly question, I don't exactly know what I should be searching :).\n    submitted by    /u/ApprehensiveMath  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not sure how the performance of those drives in the easystore are compared to the ones that go on sale as a sole drive.\n ​\n thanks for inputs!\n    submitted by    /u/Glow587  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously I am going to be needing a bit more storage space than the 240GB M2 SSD that's already in there. For my intents and purposes I expect to be needing about 10 TB of space. I have already settled for SSDs as opposed to HDDs because of various factors (biggest ones being power and noise) and I am currently working on a plan to integrate them into a flexible system of drives. Since the Nuc I plan on getting only supports one more 2.5\" drive I am going to have to come up with solutions to connect the drives externally.

I have two 500gb drives, which is barely large enough for anything. i wanted to merge it into a Spanned Volume so that I'd have a 1tb drive.\n My question if one fails then what happens to my data. As i said, I can replace the series, since I got them all from the internet or by backing up my DVD collection, so I don't mind it but it would be inconvenient.\n Since it's just series, performance isnt much of a concern, as long as the shows play smoothly, I'd be happy.\n Also would it ware my drives out faster. They're pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven't seen much use. It's just 500GB's each so I don't mind them breaking in a few years but until the prices of the 5tb's in my country come down a bit, I don't want to replace them.\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Upstairs_Item1935  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical's traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).\n Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned \"somewhere between\" Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there's currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.\n The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I'll leave it at that.\n  \nWhat I didn't see in the coverage (if I'm not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we're talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc's inorganic pitting \"secret sauce\" or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?\n I'd be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:\n  \nHow optimistic you are about this project?\n Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we're talking WORM) backup.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/danielrosehill  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you're familiar with his content, he's been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he's a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it's a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won't be around for long, since he's been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you've ever watched any of his content, you'd know he's extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff.

          "description": "Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I'm thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.\n I've come across some comments like \"NAS isn't intended to be turned on/off\" or vague comments such as \"they aren't rated for that\" but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don't see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.\n Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.\n    submitted by    /u/seeminglyugly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was \"stored\" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)\n I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?\n Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.\n I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical\n (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so.
