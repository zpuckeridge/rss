For anyone who doesn't use these forums, they have been dying over the years as people move to other social media platforms and with the decline in usage comes a decline in maintenance. Sometimes all the images disappear, videos get removed, or whole forum domains go down. Most of what's on these forums isn't super useful but there's a handful of threads showing highly custom stuff that is relevant to my own projects.\n I would like to be able to archive a thread in its entirety for later reference to include images, videos, and other links. I played around with ArchiveBox some and archiving with a link depth of 1 seems to gather all that, but also grabs all the other irrelevant links that are on a forum page that I don't care for. I also can only archive a thread one page at a time using ArchiveBox, which doesn't work for threads that might go on for hundreds of pages.\n I did some research and I think what I am looking for is a web scraper tool that can snag all the thread posts and associated links on a page, then cycle to the next page in the thread and repeat until all the pages have been archived....so with all that being said I am looking for recommendations for tools that might fit this use case.\n Since I don't think there's much overlap between self hosters and people who frequent the forums (though I might be wrong) here are two links of example threads that I would love to make sure I have indefinite access to (so long as I maintain my homelab).\n  \nExample 1\n Example 2\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Blackhawk706  \n [link]   [comments]",

In addition to that I host a Nextcloud instance that we use for our infrastructure. Though I've got Nextcloud running on bare metal, I've got the collabora server running in a docker container on the same machine. All of this is sitting behind and Nginx reverse proxy manager which itself is running in a docker container. The problem I'm having is when I try to embed calendars from next cloud onto the WordPress site I get an error on next cloud saying it cannot copy the HTML code to the clipboard. All of the SSL is sorted. Everything behind the reverse proxy has a self-signed certificate which the proxy trusts and then Nginx handles the external stuff with let's encrypt. I've also noted that I cannot copy and paste directly onto next cloud office documents. At least not with the mouse I have to use control v etc. I'm wondering if there's something I need to pass to the reverse proxy to give stuff like next cloud behind the rivers proxy access to the clipboard.

I am very sure that my self-hosted AdGuard Home container is causing problems for me.\n I am currently often playing Modern Warfare 2 in the evening / night and I am playing and the Steam connection is randomly lost. First I thought of the Steam servers of course but I'm the only one with problems. It happens every day or at least every second day. And then the connection is lost and won't reconnect for at least 5 minutes I guess. Then it often works again.\n I tried to change the DNS server in the settings of my ethernet adapter on Windows 11 (to 8.8.8.8 e.g. instead of the local server) where I have my server 192.168.178.xx and as second 1.1.1.1 and flushed the DNS and it instantly worked again. So it seems to be that it has something to do with my DNS by AdGuard Home. But how the hell I am I supposed to really validate it or better fix it?\n The internet stays online while this disconnect in Steam is happening. Everything keeps working. Only Steam is not.\n Does anybody have an idea? I am pretty sure its caused by the DNS...\n    submitted by    /u/CptDayDreamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got a dedicated HP-109a with VMs and about 30 dockers. and I've had an HP microserver N40L running for over 10 years, most of it running on unRAID. It's got about 7 disks in It. Some 4TB, 3TB, 2TB etc.. About 15TB in total. N40L is getting a bit old now.. it for the most part shares out large media files over jellyfin. \n Was thinking of just getting 1 x 20TB disk in the HP-109a and having that as my NAS and container server & VMs.. it should handle the load OK.. i Can keep the N40L as an offline backup... I can live with loosing a week or so of data without parity. Don't think I need the RAID performance.. any other considerations?\n    submitted by    /u/matda59  \n [link]   [comments]",

First, I need to get my cruicial infrastructure (router, servers) backed up.\n As for the backend: I am using Wasabi with an encryption setup - I want to use it as my off-site backup, purely. Hence rclone mount .... I did see Restic can do that on it's own (making me believe it might just consume the RClone API) but I am not sure if Borg can.\n In the end, I am also not sure if I want to use multiple repositories or not; probably depends on the program.\n Would love if you could give me some input on this!

          "description": "TLDR;\n I'm torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability/recoverability. Hence I am looking for some (long-term) experiences from people who have tried or are using SeaweedFS.\n Full story;\n I have been following SeaweedFS for quite some time and I loved it initially, however, as time progresses and I learned more about it I got a bit worried about its recoverability.\n I tested it locally and had some issues with it, but those were mainly due to my own lack of knowledge with regards to SeaweedFS and Linux. My failures are what made me initially doubt the recoverability potential of the software since I did have data-loss during my tests. Luckily it was only test-data.\n When you initially start reading about SeaweedFS it sounds really easy to set up and get started with, and it is, but there are so many things to be aware of when using it \"in production\" that are not always clear in the beginning. For example: The Filer *IS* a single point of failure if you don't back it up (even though the GitHub page states that there is no single point of failure). Or that it's best to use config files instead of cli parameters when running in production.\n On the other hand, if you know you need to keep these things in mind, then it doesn't really form an issue.\n I'm really torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability and recoverability, and I'm looking for some experiences from people that have tried it are using SeaweedFS, especially long-term use.\n    submitted by    /u/Stitch10925  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm calling this my doomsday drive, as I'm hoping to store this in a safe at my parents home and potentially safe within my home.\n ​\n I'm curious if anyone has any templates out there or has any ideas for this. My documentation has by no means been good and I'm trying to get better and by adding items into my notion.so account (not self hosted, may get smite'd for this).\n ​\n Edit:\n Taking all the feedback I received this is the plan I'm going with:\n  \nMoving from LastPass over to Bitwarden (this has been on my mind for awhile but this gave me the momentum to go through with it).\n Using https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr provided from u/felipefideli as a template for accounts and just general personal info that will be stored within Bitwarden.\n Continuing documentation and building a static website for the documentation with instructions of how to spin up the container as well as a copy of it so it can be ran on a rasp pi which will be stored in my parents safe. Will also be writing these in text(markdown) files as well, will be encrypted as well.\n Recovery codes are going to be stored within bitwarden as well as physical copies stored at my bank and at my parents safe, this is only in case something were to happen to my phone as my fiancé knows how to access it. \n Currently in the process of learning Ansible and setting up AWX so if something fails in the short term (like NVR) I will have templates to easily fix it.\n Continuing teaching my brother my environment.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/JANGxBANGER  \n [link]   [comments]",

Those images are invaluable for planning and correcting errors the next year, because plans rarely adapt to the reality, and details evolve organically.\n Generally, we have 700-1000 pictures, from diverse sources. It's complicated when all you have is a big folder to search in.\n So, i'm looking for a selfhosted app where you can geotag a photo, and show it on a map very close, showing roughly 500m² of terrain or less. Ideally an orientation indicator would be useful. A good point would be filtering the points/pictures by tags on the map. For tagging, OpenStreetMap is exact where we are, because of micro-mapping and high precision points, and all that matters is relative positioning anyway.\n I'm already testing apps, but what i want is never a selling point. Map view are often limited to a low zoom, or the pictures shown in full instead of points. Basically i need to install every single one listed on the big list, and it's not an efficient process, when i can ask for help here too ! ;)\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Moff_Tigriss  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I want to run a project, I log on to the machine, clone the repo and run a command to build and serve it.\n I develop and update projects from my main machine, and whenever I push an update I have to log on to the relevant machine and do the whole process manually over again.\n What I would like is to be able to upgrade, rebuild, and rerun the projects on each machine, from a central dashboard of some sort, eliminating the need to log on to each machine. Ideally I would like to hook this up with some git events so that the whole process is automated.\n I feel like there has to be some software that does this, that's not enterprise level. I was recently looking at portainer, which I think does what I want, but I don't have everything in containers so it doesn't work for me.\n ​\n Surely someone here has experience with this problem and can offer some advice!\n Thanks a lot in advance for any help.\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/modenv  \n [link]   [comments]",

So now I have it run on a old laptop in my office, and I use ddns.org for dynamic DNS. I'd like to start up a second service on the same machine, and access the original calendar service at a URL like myfake.ddnsdomain.org/calendar/ and the new notes-like service at myfake.ddnsdomain.org/notes/\n I tried using nginx to redirect the /calendar/ URL suffix from my HTTP port to a different port on which the Django app was running, and that worked for the initial page, but that same suffix was not appended the follow-up HTTP requests from the client side. How can I achieve this behavior without modifying the code for the calendar app? (Of course, I can technically do it for the calendar app, but then I wouldn't have a solution for the other services...)\n Is this possible? Or do I have to do something different, like should I do a 301 request to a different port and open multiple on my home router?\n    submitted by    /u/MrMallIronmaker  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm trying to set up cloudflare zero trust, so I can generate some traffic over it. I will be honest, I'm doing this just so I can get a code for yubikey, since I'm interested in a hardware 2FA key and how they work and this is a deal which I wouldn't want to miss. I know the deal is valid until the end of December, so I want to try to get the code. \n So far, I applied for the offer, but I got an email saying right now, I'm not eligible. What I did meantime is:\n  \nRun a vaultwarden docker container on a laptop which has an IP 192.168.1.x and I can access it from other local devices.\n On zero cloud website under Access > Applications, I added the app, with a type \"Private net\" and application url is the IP above, allow rule for policies\n Created a tunnel under access > tunnels and run a connector on the same laptop where the docker is. Once it was run, status was connected on the website\n Next thing I did is I created a user under my team > users. Login method is one-time PIN which gets sent on the email.\n When I login, I type team domain I got from settings > general, it asks for email, sends the code, I type it in and it shows the app I created in the step two.\n The problem is, when I click the app, it redirects me to the IP 192.168.1.x as it's an application url, but only if I'm on the local WiFi. If I try the procedure from my mobile data, obviously it fails as it redirects to the mentioned IP\n  \nIn both cases (WiFi and mobile data) it doesn't generate any traffic on cloudflare website at all as DNS requests, top logins by app are empty. So can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong or which step I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/OkKitchen1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here comes the problem, I tried iptables, ufw, firewalld always worked fine till a restart, after that i found that docker overwirtes the rules and pass its rules first... \n I found whalewall, and I get some success with it, but i ask myself, that is the best way to do it?

Since then I've been migrating services from that \"master\" LXC into dedicated containers, which was particularly useful for Home Assistant, which is increasingly a total nightmare to run pretty much anywhere outside HAOS. So, HASS, Unifi and Logitech Media Server all live outside that LXC, and they're pretty happy living outside on their own. I don't mind taking the slight hit to memory as I've got plenty in the server.\n But now I'm wondering if I should move nextcloud outside as well. Can folks recommend an approach? Looks like NextCloudPi is one option. Any opinions from others who are in the same sort of proxmox deliberations?

I can only send from the registered e-mail address (eg. secretname@provider.com) because everything else (eg. secretname@mydomain.com) wouldn't be allowed by that specific mail provider.\n This isn't a problem when I'm sending notifications to myself, but some self hosted services rely on e-mail. For example Gitea \"anonymizes\" emails like github does. So it gives users mail addresses like skdfhskdjf@noreply.my-gitea-instance.de\n This is a feature that I can't use with above limitations. Now I am searching for a better solution where I can send e-mails from my own domain or whatever else.\n Should I host a very basic (sending only) mail server myself? Or should I register somewhere, where I can create unlimited e-mail accounts for my own domain and still use the msmtp route?\n The last one seems difficult because I already use that domain for my private e-mail. So in that domain's DNS is already the MX records of my mail provider. Which doesn't allow multiple accounts etc. I'm not sure if I can set MX records of another provider on the same domain... PS: I don't want to switch away from my existing mail provider.\n What would you do?\n    submitted by    /u/Trevor_Tn1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Here is the docker-compose.yml I used: \n version: \"3.2\" services: mssql: image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest' container_name: orion_db hostname: sql1 ports: - '1433:1433' environment: - ACCEPT_EULA=Y - SA_PASSWORD=<insertpassword> volumes: - '/.drive:/var/opt/mssql' \n Both VMs are on the same subnet with a firewall rule for the Ubuntu VM to explicitly allow connections from the Windows Server VM over ports 1433 and 1434. The DB server has also been configured to allow outbound connections through the CLI.\n However, when launching Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on the Windows Server VM, I am only able to see the databases running on the Windows Server VM, even when selecting \"Network Servers\". Is there a step I missed or did I misconfigure something?\n    submitted by    /u/Extension_Lunch_9143  \n [link]   [comments]",

Nothing was hosted on it yet, but it is the name I would like to launch this business under.\n I forgot (stupidly) to renew my domain. It expired at the end of September. It is currently in the \"redemption period.\" My registrar was Namecheap. They said I could get it out of redemption for about $100 (I forget the exact amount) or that if I just waited eventually it would be released *as long as nobody buys it at the auction.* My initial plan was to just wait it out, and I should be getting close to the time where it is released per Namecheap's associate... Today, the Whois is still saying Namecheap redemption period.\n But I was thinking today, where is this auction? I can't seem to find anything with google. There shouldn't basically any value to this website (I did have content on it like 10 years ago but that has long since been taken down), but I don't really want to lose it to someone who might get it at an auction because I'm being cheap. So, if I could just go to the auction and win it there...wouldn't that work?\n I'm a little over my head in this one and appreciate any help.

That way, I get rid a lot of noise, I reduce situations where I contact a stranger cause he/she picked up the old number of an acquaintance. Im just curious if there's any lost to losing people's contact. It happens all the time right?\n For 2, what's a good way to deduplicate them on all platforms? I have started with the contacts in Google. I went through each contact, cleaned up and standardized the data fields. Moving onto Telegram, I see a tonne of repeats. I feel I should sync between the curated Google contact list and Telegram, pray for some magic deduplication, and then sort through the rest again. Rinse and repeat for Whatsapp, then phone. Thing is, I'm unsure how the syncing works and if it will result in many more duplication on all involved platforms. There's v little visibility into which way the sync occurs. If it's 'To Google contacts', I can see what's out of place and edit accordingly. But anything else, manual curation and I'm bound to make mistakes cause I'm human.\n For 3, really, how do you do it?\n    submitted by    /u/pestlemortar  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I've learnt -the hard way- that Budibase really isn't meant to build ant kind of app that has a public side.\n So I have two options : either I use my website (ghost) for the content and Budibase for data management and workflow ease / automation AND a form builder like limesurvey for the forms or I find something that can do both what Budibase can and can't do. Honnestly, two softwares is already enough softwares. I'd rather not use three.\n Is there anything that would fit the requirement ?

          "description": "So I have a bunch of dockerized services. Most of them are setup with a self-signed certificate to work via https, so chrome shuts up whenever I visit them. There are two problems with this: It's a pain in the ass and some services just refuse to do SSL.\n Reverse proxies to the rescue, right? There even is this docker image, that promises to magically do the job: https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy But then I have to deal with a bunch of DNS crap. My router knows that \"pi\" is supposed to be 192.168.178.3, but has no idea what nextcloud.pi is supposed to be.\n So as far as I know I could either buy a domain with subdomains or I could host my own DNS. I tried the adguard home docker image to host my own DNS and could even resolve the nslookup when explicitly told to resolve via the selfhosted DNS, but my router does not like that. I configured the router to use my selfhosted DNS for DNSv4 requests, but left the DNSv6 on default, since I don't think I can assign a static IPv6 to my raspberry pi that runs the DNS. I believe it is using that DNSv6 server, though. Also, I don't want to have no working internet whenever my raspberry pi has issues, so I don't like doing it this way.\n At this point I tried going the simple route: Just tell Chrome to shut the hell up whenever I go to that one server. But it seems like that also just will not work. \n So do I have to buy a random domain to get this to work? That seems no less annoying. Is there no better way? Am I getting anything wrong? Should I just switch to Firefox?\n    submitted by    /u/SendMeOrangeLetters  \n [link]   [comments]",

My goal is expose them publicly.:\n  \nhttps://host1.priv.foo.com\n https://host2.priv.foo.com\n  \nThis seems easy and so I configure NPM proxy hosts as follows:\n  \nDomain name:host1.foo.com, Scheme: https, Forward Hostname: host1.priv.foo.com, Port:443\n Domain name:host2.foo.com, Scheme: https, Forward Hostname: host2.priv.foo.com, Port:443\n  \nhost1.foo.com works as expected; however, host2.foo.com routes to https://host1.priv.foo.com.

So the backlog is pretty big - and many memorable memories are hidden within.\n I looked at Damselfy but it seems to be geared more towards photographers, not for point-and-shoot type photography like random ol' me just snapping a picture because of something happening.\n Do you know of one that can: - Iterate through all my files and organize them by their (EXIF, largely) metadata? - Has an Android app so I can view them when on the go? (Yes, my hosted instance will be available outside through a Nebula VPN setup.) - Optionally recognize and thus \"tag\" pictures by faces? It'd be neat to pull up all the pictures with a specific person in it.\n Thanks! :)\n    submitted by    /u/IngwiePhoenix  \n [link]   [comments]",

For version 1.3.0 I focused on self-hosting.\n It should be your own choice where you want to host your code and your application. And this was something a really disliked on Heroku, that you can only deploy from GitHub.\n I'm happy to announce that Kubero now supports\n  \nGitLab\n Gitea\n Gogs\n Bitbucket\n GitHub.\n  \nYou can now automatically deploy your apps with a git push\n from any of these git providers. It does not matter if it's hosted on codeberg.org or gitlab.com or your self-hosted instance.\n I hope you like it, and if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other git repositories, please let me know.\n PS: Onedev was also planned, but I was not able to find any API documentation. I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. It is still on my roadmap.

I have tried Navidrome and generally find it inferior to Airsonic, with very little interest in using it as my main player. \n My goal would be to be able to queue up music from my phone to play in various rooms throughout the house. \n I like the ability to control each room's volume from my phone (like Google home, however their multi room audio has been terrible since they lost the Sonos lawsuit. I don't even bother with it anymore) as well as toggling rooms on and off. If it was possible to send different streams to different rooms simultaneously, that would be incredible. \n Lastly I might be interested in Home Assistant integration, though it's not a requirement.

The Update contains some new features, optimizations and a few fixes. Check out the Changelog for the full list of changes. Below some highlights of the new update:\n Recurring Transactions & Split:\n It's now possible to manually split a Bank Transaction for multiple Buckets. In addition, if the amount assigned to a Bucket is lower than the Transaction itself, the remaining amount is displayed. Creation of Recurring Transactions has been added too. This is useful if you mainly add your Bank Transactions manually instead of importing txt/csv files.\n Themes:\n Themes are now supported. Visit Bootswatch for more details. To select a theme use the new option APPSETTINGS_THEME as docker environment variable or in the appsettings.json file.\n Import Page Redesign:\n Import page got some slight redesign. You can now switch between all steps in an accordion view, where each section is enabled depending on your input.\n As usual any kind of feedback is highly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/The_Axelander  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most mentioned one was dark mode, so we did our best to make a usable and readable version of dark mode.\n 👇 Here is the new version of memos with dark mode. Please enjoy.\n Dark mode in memos v0.8.1\n BTW. Personally, I really like services that support self-hosted, like trilium, mastodon and so on. From the first day when I created the repo of memos, I decided that it should be permanently free and open source, and mainly support self-hosted.

          "description": "My guess: the answer is no (but I am still happy to hear your thoughts).\n I have somewhat around ~20 IMAP email accounts (more like ~50 when you count all the aliases) with different domains, servers and whatnot. It's always a hassle when something changes to also update my email clients on various computers, smartphones and so on. Also: I have a laptop for work on which I don't want to install a private email client. \n The obvious answer to my \"problem\" is to have a webmail client which has access to all my IMAP mailboxes ... but I am not sure if I am comfortable with putting a service out there that can access all my personal data. I have basic knowledge of IT security and high respect of selfhosting critical applications on internet-connected machines. \n As convenience is always kinda opposed to security, I guess, my question is: how big is the risk when using something like RoundCube on a VPS? Can I easily harden it to a degree that it is still comfortable to use but also secure (enough)? How can I test security and monitor dangers like automated attacks or hacking attempts? Is it a good balance between secure and convenient to not host on a public VPS but on a sever that is only reachable via VPN/wireguard/tailscale...?\n TL;DR: How would you set up a webmail client that has access to all your mailboxes in a way that makes you feel safe?\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hope I have the correct subreddit for my question :)\n I have an old pc that runs docker and manage it through portainer. Looking at lots of YouTube video's how to savely expose my Nextcloud instance. Well, I found a very interesting option called Cloudflare Zero Trust. No need to open ports on my router and use a proxy for save connection.\n I have setup a tunnel with a subdomain nextcloud.mydomain.com with service HTTP and url 192.168.x.xx:8080. After that created an application that bypasses my home ip. Now I can access Nextcloud via http://nextcloud.mydomain.com. Till now I get it and works, but my question is...\n Is using HTTP a bad thing? Is the connection between the browser and cloudflare HTTPS and between cloudflare and my server HTTP?\n Hope someone might explain a bit more and if there are any tips how to improve the setup.

As much as I hate this scenario, I figured maybe someone might help me out and this would be a good reference for someone as well.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Wanted to share what we've been working on at Grist. We've been experimenting with AI-generated Python formulas to help everyday spreadsheet users write formulas in spreadsheets. Why? Spreadsheets are the original low-code platform – sprinkle in a little bit of code and you get a big benefit. But that little bit of code can be daunting for some. What if AI could bridge the gap between what the user needs a formula to do, as expressed in plain English, and the correct formula?\n While AI spreadsheet formula writing is not new, Grist has two benefits:\n  \nGrist supports Python formulas in the spreadsheet. Current AI models are quite good at writing Python code, and getting better. As a bonus, by writing formulas in Python, this tool could help spreadsheet users learn Python, a more universal and capable language than traditional spreadsheet functions.\n A Grist document is a relational database with its schema neatly described in Python in Grist's \"Code View,\" which is available to the bot, helping it make inferences.\n  \nWe tested the experiment using formulas from our template gallery to approximate real use cases. The AI-generated formulas were correct 36 out of 48 times in the minimal experiment dataset. You can view the results of that test here: https://public.getgrist.com/n3jAtRYDSVWe/AI-Formula-dataset\n And a gif to show it in action! \n https://i.redd.it/2tlx5xfl953a1.gif\n While this feature is not yet a part of Grist for the everyday spreadsheet user, we wanted to share the experiment's code with self-hosters who might want to play with it.\n  \nSource code: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/345\n Documentation: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/blob/formula-prompt/documentation/llm.md\n \n If you're unfamiliar with Grist, here's a recap from an earlier Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/su6tv3/grist_free_open_source_alternative_to_airtable/\n    submitted by    /u/anaisconce  \n [link]   [comments]",

Such as self-hosted remote workspaces. Not sure if it allows for policy management in addition to access management.\n - VMware Workspace One - Offers exactly what we need, including LDAP sync, but is not self-hosted and requires a 25-user or 25-device minimum, which is much more than we need at the moment.\n -PGina - It is free, open source, and self-hosted but not actively maintained and only offers Windows Authentication and no policy controls.\n We've also considered spinning up a Microsoft Active Directory instance, establishing a trust between it and our FreeIPA instance, and having Windows computers access it over VPN, but that only solves the problem for Windows computers.\n Are any of you familiar with any self-hosted applications which allow for Unified Device Management similar to what we are looking for?\n    submitted by    /u/Filiecs  \n [link]   [comments]",

The idea came when ImageShack removed pictures that I was hot-linking at online forums and here we are after all these years.\n Chevereto is a family company, I'm in charge of the software and my wife does marketing.

          "description": "Hi!\n I've been hosting a few http services both in my Pi at home, and in a public cloud and I don't like the VPN way of accessing my services. Sometimes I need to browse my server in a friends computer or phone, and it gets messy or impractical, so I end up exposing the services to the public web sometimes. I worry quite a bit about forgetting to update my software and finding my server being used to host sketchy bank scams.\n What I have been thinking of doing is blacklisting every IP in my nginx reverse proxy, but allowing a single HTTP endpoint to be accessed, like \"allow.domain.com\", where after receiving any http request, it would add the origin IP into the whitelist for a set amount of time (a few hours). I would also setup geoblock to only allow the endpoint to be accessed from my country.\n The point is that I don't need a super locked-down set up, I just want the peace of mind that my server is not just visible to anyone. If I am at work I can authorize my ip for a few hours just by accessing a simple endpoint, if I want to share a file with a friend I can forward them a link without having to worry about setting up a VPN connection for them, just letting them know they first have to go to allow.domain.com before trying to open my link every few hours or days. \n Is that ok? I searched a bit to see if there's something like this prod. ready but I couldn't find. I know it's still the single point of failure of the http service being open to the web, and the fact that it's a bit \"security through obscurity\", but I just need something to give a little reassurance and more security than just being blindly open to the world. I am not hosting copyrighted media, or anything illegal, just a few status servers, change detection, python-notebook, a few api's I made for my work, non-private files, etc.\n    submitted by    /u/mefudi  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear all that read this,\n I’m new in this self-hosting game, I’ve been watching this sub and looking into self hosting myself for quite some time but haven’t been able to for money reasons.\n I want to self host for multiple reasons. First reason, chalenge, i don’t have much infra/system/server/network experience, i have a beginning diploma but I don’t have the school smarts to continue. Second reason, fun, I like tech, always have and I love having these kind of projects. Third, privacy, in my tech journey I’ve discovered how messed up compagnies handle your data and i don’t like it. Fourth and important one for this post, I kind of want to put this in my resume somehow, might even be a part of my resume, or even could be the full resume if I can somehow.\n So, my actual question is : since i want my self hosting on my resume, and i know that in entreprise level hosting, they mostly use Kubernetes and not docker (wich i am currently using but can change that, I’m not toi far yet) should I and can I use Kubernetes on my main and only server as a server with no Kubernetes clients attached to it, I might and probably will attach more servers to it in the future but for now is it actually doable and is it worth it ? I could also make multiple VMs in my main server and cluster those together but i know that doesn’t go too well with the Kubernetes philosophy so not too sure what to think about that. Anyway, I’m waiting on all of your opinions to see what i can/should do, thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Luckeysthebest  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is made in .NET Framework 4.7.2 so it needs an application called Mono to run. In case anyone doesn't know, Mono is a conversion layer to run .NET Framework applications on Linux.\n Now on the same VM i'm trying to run another console application i wrote, but this one is written in .NET 6. This version of .NET does not need mono anymore, so my exe should be able to run natively (as long as i have the .NET 6 packages installed which i do). However Mono has hijacked my './' command so now when i try to run the .NET 6 exe i get a mono error.\n What i want to achieve is to be able to run the .NET 6 normally, and explicitly use the 'mono' command when i want to run older .NET framework exe's. I don't want it to run mono when i use the './' command. How can i achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/YourNightmar31  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll get there, I'm confident.\n Where do I start? Install software like nextcloud and docker through DSM and continue from there or do you circumvent DSM completely and ... ?

I can pull 32GB of DDR4 from my desktop (and upgrade in the process) and I have SSD's/M.2 drives, so I'm not concerned about storage.

I picked up a Beelink SEi12 yesterday for $350, comes with 16gb of ram and 500gb storage.\n I currently use my PC to serve Plex to my family, but am looking to move that to the Beelink (I got the SEi12 instead of a Ryzen box to take advantage of QuickSync). I'm also looking to host my own Bitwarden, Lightning wallet, DNS, usenet, cloud storage... basically anything I can.\n I use 3.5\" HDDs to store video and large files. Obviously those will not fit inside the little Beelink. Whats the best solution for housing HDDs? Would a DS220j work? Or something similar?\n TLDR; setting up first home server.

So I can, let's say, have now 3 machines but in the future add some more and manage their containers from some UI or something.\n Thanks in advance.\n EDIT: After seeing lots of comments and wrapping my head around Portainer, Kubernetes even Podman, I think for now I'm going to go with Portainer because:\n 1- It seems simpler, since it's just Docker and I've been using that for the past months\n 2- Kubernetes seems more suitable when you need to manage a cluster and big stuff, add like HA to your services, and overall, too complex for my use case. However, I really liked the idea, and I'll definitely try it out for fun when I have some time\n 3- Also I've seen that regarding memory usage, Kubernetes tend to hog more than plain Docker, and that's a concern for me since I plan on using Raspberrys for now (or at least until I have enough money to get a decent home server)\n Thanks again to all of you that commented, I have still a lot to learn!\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeRabid  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Heimdall v2.5.0 has just dropped, let us know how you get on with it.\n  \nRelease notes: https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall/releases/tag/v2.5.0\n Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall\n Docker: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest\n Discord: https://discord.gg/CCjHKn4\n  \nBig thanks to https://github.com/keriati for putting in a lot of effort to get things moving again.\n The big changes this release:\n  \nUpdated the underlying framework to Laravel 8, this will be the last version that supports PHP 7.4, v2.6.0 will move to Laravel 9 and require a min of PHP8.0. Just because this version works on PHP7.4 you are still encouraged to use PHP8 instead though\n Updated all the composer and npm dependencies (the latter of which are generally only used in dev)\n Lots of bugs fixed, including one that has been around for 3 years, where cookies would expire and the user would be left with an error 500. Turns out this was an issue when people were running multi-user, it's now finally fixed!\n Some basic keyboard navigation has been added.\n MySQL and PostgreSQL are both now officially supported in addition to SQLite.\n Stop polling when the API returns an error.\n Added a bunch of translations, some of the strings had to be google translated as some were missing though.\n A bunch of fixes have been applied to apps, such as the password field should work properly now.\n There is also a background job that updates old config files if newer ones have been released.\n Private apps and app development has been fixed\n There are instructions for running without external access to the app, however things like automatically downloading icons wont work in that case. This is also experimental, so let us know if we can improve this.\n Doing a tile search will now open the first item in the search results instead of returning an error.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ls_kode  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello there\n I've been trying out different photo galleries, but none really managed to do what I hope to achieve. For some context, I have a huge library of artworks and content of different artists online (some might call that Linux ISOs). I have everything on my server, but I need a tool to easily view these from a browser.\n Those few photo management solutions that support existing directory structure, all have some kind of downside.\n - Nextcloud photos can't actually use the correct alphanumerical sorting and goes from \"1 (1).png\" to \"1 (10).png\" instead of \"1 (2).png\". The issue for that seems to be stale or just forgotten because it's open for like 3 years -.-\n - PhotoView has some problems with displaying large directories, as it makes giant database queries every time you switch a directory\n - Lychee is quite nice, but its import process is just too slow. With a library of around 300k images and videos, it takes for ever to import that once, but every consecutive one takes forever as well…\n - PiGallery2 is the only one that seems to be fast enough with what experience I want, but still some of the tasks in the background for indexing or general preview generation also takes a long time.\n ​\n Just to clarify, I don't need syncing to my phone or whatever other features solutions like Immich has. I just need something to quickly browse a giant library of photos and videos.\n Are there any solutions I haven't come across, that could help me in this case?\n    submitted by    /u/TheSeventhCode  \n [link]   [comments]",

One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.\n The new Appwrite Console in v1.1\n Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.\n To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.\n In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:\n 🖥️ Dashboard\n 🔐 Authentication\n 💽 Databases\n 🪣 Storage\n ⚡ Functions\n 🧙 New Wizards\n ... and more!\n Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.\n We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI.

Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.\n For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.\n 40k photos in one view\n Progress update as of 11/22/2022\n tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.\n Some of the major new features:\n Live Photo Support\n  \nThanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.\n HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.\n  \nVideo Transcoding\n  \nMemories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.\n Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1\n  \nMultiple Timeline Folders\n  \nFor maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.\n You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)\n  \nServer side encryption\n  \nIf you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore\n  \nNew metadata sidebar\n  \nYou can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar\n  \nNew photo viewer\n  \nWith some fancy UX. Try it out ;)\n  \nThe full changelog can be found here.\n If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊\n    submitted by    /u/radialapps  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.\n I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.\n Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.\n At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?\n    submitted by    /u/Chaos_Therum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.\n Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.\n 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.\n  \nHuginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nautomatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted (for now).\n  \nn8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.\n  \nHosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.\n  \nBeehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nPower Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.\n  \nHosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).\n ---\n I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.\n 👇 Links to these tools in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/usamaejazch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.\n I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).\n I have the following setup:\n  \nCloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.\n \nNginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.\n \nOpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.\n \n I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.\n Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.\n    submitted by    /u/xViMeSx  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I also see some people be a little bit bummed out by the lack of devices on the free plan. Well fear not as tailscale has a plan which is made for open-source projects to use, and also for friend/family use. The Github Community Plan.\n This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. \n Step 1: Create a github account\n Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)\n Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.\n Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with \"Select Network\" as it should be under the \"Multi-user tailnet\" banner.\n Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the \"Github Community Plan\".\n Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. \n Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.\n    submitted by    /u/Stetsed  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I am leaning to option one because it would be simpler and continues with my business plan to expand into my own software, create mirrored servers for redundancy etc...\n Edit: I am also worried about potential liability concerns regarding data loss.

Just a tool that notifies me (e.g. using a WebHook, Telegram, ..) if a disk/mountpoint is almost full. It would be nice if it's possible to also get a notification if a systemd service fails or define custom shell commands but that's not as important. Prometheus and all these databases seem like overkill. It should be as lightweight as possible (RAM usage, disk usage, dependencies).\n If such a thing does not exist yet, let me know if you'd be interested. I might create such a tool if no one comes up with something. If you think such a tool doesn't make sense without time-series data (and graphs) let me know why you think so please.\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/flo-at  \n [link]   [comments]",

I come across a lot of programs that I'd like to try out on a 2nd server so I don't mess anything up on my primary server. I don't want mass texts about plex being down. So I just spun up a 2nd server running proxmox and an ubuntu server vm. I installed docker, docker compose, and I'd like to kind of mirror my original unraid setup and get everything proxied through NPM, but I'm having a hard time getting it set up with the same domain. \n When I try to go through the cloudflare tunnel setup it says I already have mydomain.net with a DNS record. Is it possible to have 2 instances of NPM on 2 different machines using the same domain and cloudflare tunnels or do I need to get a 2nd domain? I'm not sure how to describe this situation to search for a guide for it. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/colev14  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can access the web interfaces for these two services on my WiFi network on any device currently. \n My end goal is to be able to access these services over the internet (without having to be on the same network) on my custom domain, which is registered on Njalla.\n Currently from all my internet troubleshooting what I've gathered is I need to add DNS records to my Njalla domain, do port forwarding on my router and run an nginx reverse proxy?\n What I can't seem to find is a good guide to do this. I went into my router settings and did the port forwarding from ports 80-10000 for a test for both TCP/UDP mapped to the RPi, but when I check online using port checkers, it is still closed. How do I verify these things are working? And how do I configure nginx here?\n Any guides or explanations would be super appreciated!

I currently have 3 VLANS setup:\n  \nManagement - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc\n Home - My personal devices\n Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services\n  \nMy firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).\n I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.\n This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.\n Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?\n ​\n Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN? No right?\n    submitted by    /u/WubbaKnight  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. \n First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as \"animal\" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. \n Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members \"user level\" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. \n I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.\n It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server. Obviously, that would have its own pitfalls, but it's just a thought.\n    submitted by    /u/rtuite81  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "first off.... the code + demo:\n Repository - includes a GIF demo \n What is AmbientWeather?\n AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.\n ​\n What does your tool do?\n Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. \n If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.\n ​\n Which weather stations are supported?\n Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.\n ​\n What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?\n What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.\n ​\n Anything else?\n So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups. If you give this tool a try and hit any issues, please be patient and feel free to open an Issue or post on the Discussion board.\n    submitted by    /u/philosowaffle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can disconnect from wifi and reconnect and it works fine for 10-20 minutes and then starts having the same problem.\n Even though I have my client configured to use my dnsmasq server only (which then forwards requests it doesn't know to an external server,) it still inevitably ends up looking to Cloudflare instead of dnsmasq.\n I'm so confused as to why it would work for a bit and then just stop, especially since I'm telling my client to only talk to dnsmasq in this instance.

They're arguably one of the most recognizable names in domain registration/websites etc. I didn't have any problems with them; until I did. I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night trying to sort out an issue that should be simple. The person on the phone was obviously following their support script and I don't blame them for that, but how many times do we need to re-create the issue before you escalate it? I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say \"2SV\", is not well implemented in their system.\n For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. \n So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/ChillPill89  \n [link]   [comments]",

Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. \n I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. \n Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this?

          "description": "Hi,\n For a webapp of mine, Excel file/ODS/CSV import feature was requested, however instead of supporting a fix scheme(s), they wish to have bigger flexibility: some columns should be optional, sometimes the numbers, dates are formatted differently (because of the different locales) in those sheets, sometimes there could be a header row, or the values are starting at the 5th row, etc.\n I think these requirements are pretty general, they've certainly come up a lot, in a lot of software - personally I had to build it a couple of times, so I'm a bit borred now, and started thinking how to solve it generally. So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.\n Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.\n    submitted by    /u/Losoncziterimenekult  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm facing the issue that moving from one server to another (which shouldn't happen often, yet has to happen at some point), is a huge burden to even think about.\n So... the answer to this is... obviously, containerization, where we separate applications from data. Let's talk docker.\n However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.\n Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?\n Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.\n But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.\n How do you handle this issue? Do you have cron jobs that restart your containers every now and then and upgrade the images so that security fixes can come over?

Now it's time to announce it to more prominent communities.\n In case you don't know what Zapier is, it is a product that allows end users to integrate the web applications they use and automate workflows.\n If you want to check it out directly, you can use the following links:\n Website: automatisch.io\n Docs: automatisch.io/docs\n GitHub: https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch\n If you want to check out the screenshots of the product:\n  \nApps\n Flows\n Editor\n Executions\n Execution details\n  \nThere are existing solutions like Zapier or Make in the market, but we still wanted to build Automatisch as an open-source alternative because you can keep your data on your own servers with Automatisch. It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.\n You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.\n Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.\n ​\n Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.\n    submitted by    /u/barinali  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So my personal mastodon server ran out of space. Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:\n Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.\n Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.\n I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.\n From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.\n Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.\n (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)\n    submitted by    /u/mfsb-vbx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.\n It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.\n My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. \n Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line?

Let me also point out, Hotspot Shield's \"Hydra\" protocol is able to bypass these blocks but I'm not paying for a VPN if I know there is some way out there to bypass these blocks.\n From what I know:\n The network has its own DNS, using Google's or Cloudflare's just results in a \"The connection reset\" page instead of the block placeholder page.

          "description": "Hi all! \n I was hoping you lovely folks of /r/selfhosted would be willing to partake in a short (maximum 6 question) survey! TLDR at the bottom\n Context: I was looking at setting up a couple services from scratch a few weeks ago and thought to myself, \"I wonder if I can just buy something with it already installed.\" So I've been looking into it and I personally have not been successful in finding any kind of seller that provides this (self hosting as a service?). I have played around the idea a bit in my head and I am of the belief that there may be a few that would be possible with this method of deployment. \n Those of you who have went through the pains of starting to self-host for the first time, or those of you that are just busy: Yes or no, please let me know! This survey is completely anonymous. https://forms.gle/bXZSfXjAzoa1FsyS9\n TLDR: I want to know if a \"pre-built\" device containing requested services is something you would ever consider purchasing over setting it up from scratch yourself.\n    submitted by    /u/lolipopsandtoejam  \n [link]   [comments]",

What have I missed? I know I could host these files on the Nginx server and have them served statically, but I'd rather keep them in one place and it's only a couple of files and only being served occasionally on my local network, so ease of config/development seems to me to be mroe important than performance.\n What am I missing?\n Also, I noticed that Caddy is an Nginx alternative - can it do forwarding to Tomcat?

Features like 'Daily Mix', dynamic playlists that encompass popular songs from a particular category, 'Discover Weekly' etc. These are IME very nice features for discovering new music and expanding your music library.\n Is there something out there that's usable with something like Jellyfin?

It's very gratifying to learn that others receive value from something you created, so thanks again to everyone who gave me feedback and use whalewall.\n Probably the most useful addition in this release is the addition of a Docker image, which should make deploying or trying out whalewall much easier.

          "description": "Apologies in advance if this kind of question is not allowed here 😊\n I am looking to create a file sharing service that works on a local network (that's not exposed to the internet) .\n The use case: I'm from a remote African village where internet is expensive and slow, and lots of people (when I'm there) ask for commonly used Apks (mostly WhatsApp, and other utility things like pdf readers) and also some other kinds of files. When I can I share these /download for them.\n I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.\n My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.\n Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.\n The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/true_heart  \n [link]   [comments]",

I run a few websites that send email (~1-5k per month) and have a bunch of homelab stuff on different domains that sends transactional emails (~500 per month).\n I have been using Mailgun for the last few years and whilst good, I have started having to pay each month as the amount of emails sent goes over the free tier. This has at most been around $6-$10 in a single month. I have been tying with the thought of switching over to amazon SES as its ridiculously cheaper. I then happened to stumble on the delights of Postal (postalserver.io).\n I am now stuck toying with the idea of SES or do I host my own Postal on a VPS somewhere? I send emails from roughly 20 different domains and would like to utilise security features where possible. I understand the issues with IP reputation that comes from email delivery.\n Am i better off just sticking with SES? Overall it will probably be cheaper. Or do I go Postal with slightly more VPS monthly cost but with the freedom and much better UI / dashboards?\n ​\n OR even better can I host Postal on AWS and get postal to send via SES and utilise the 62k free emails per month (i assume this either wont work or will require each domain to be verified in SES anyway?)\n    submitted by    /u/spudd01  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been told this will stop next year as the other side of the estate is connected, however it's worrying me a little as my NAS, PC and Mac mini have all been unexpectedly shutdown a few times.

          "description": "I have been looking for a while and I'm a bit confused. As many others, my lab is composed of (close to) free stuff I gathered for years, I'd rather make things work with what I have.\n I recently upgraded my simple network (fritzbox + fritzrepeater, main network + guest access) to a more complex setup: fritzbox (as a vdsl modem), apu4c board running opnsense, Netgear GS324T managed switch, fritz repeater as an AP.\n As you can see, the fritzbox and the repeater are now far apart thus the mesh feature stopped working and with it the guest access, that's to be expected. What I don't understand is the following: for the guest access to work between the fritzbox and the repeater, there has to be some vlan shenningans, I doubt AVM invented a brand new mechanism to separate traffic. My guess was that somehow all fritzbox ports were trunked with the default vlan being for the main network and all traffic from guest access was tagged with a vlan id.\n I tried setting it up like that, but I couldn't identify the vlan id (tried a bunch but that's tedious and I'm unsure how to inspect traffic at the switch, never done port mirroring before, not sure how to use linux to listen to it).\n Anyway, my question is, does anyone know if AVM could be using some other technology? Is there another way to use a fritz repeater to have two separate networks?\n    submitted by    /u/bendem  \n [link]   [comments]",

On Windows 10, running iperf to a TrueNAS box with 2 10Gb ports bondeed together, I am getting 6Gb/s on a single thread, which I don't think is too bad.\n ​\n But when I run multiple tests over time, it eventually drops to 2.4 ish....I thought maybe the NIC was overheating, but I ziptied a fan to it and it still seems to be having trouble. The drivers for this card were absolute dogshit to setup, and I'm to the point I\"m probably going to grab an intel 10gb nic instead....\n ​\n Does anyone else have experience with 10gb that could tell me maybe why I'm getting this weirdly sudden and consistent drop in speed? I'm using an HPNC523SFP on both sides of the connection, with a Mikrotik CRS317 running SWOS in the middle here. The NAS Server is running Proxmox with the 2 ports bonded in lacp mode passed to a bridge that a TrueNAS VM is using. The ports are set both in active mode on the switch, and the client is just a plain ass Windows 10 box.\n ​\n I can't think of anything else significant I have configured here...\n    submitted by    /u/QuirkyKirk96  \n [link]   [comments]",

The ISP's coax cable enters the flat on the corner of the living room so all the wired stuff has to live within immediate vicinity of it. \n That means I have to be very careful picking equipment - everything has to be quiet and not very hideous. Enter, my homelab:\n Not too ugly, no?\n The loudest piece here is the big NAS. Everything else is completely silent. The NAS has 12 hard disks generating a noticeable, persistent buzzing sound. Thankfully, it's only audible if the room is entirely silent. If there is anything on the TV I can't hear it at all.\n On the wireless side, most devices are on the TP-Link AP. It supports VLANs and has decent coverage. The Netgear AP only exists to deliver as fast a connection as possible to my desktop PC on the other side of the flat. More on that here.\n Overall, this is what the network map looks like:\n https://preview.redd.it/bgqugnty5n5a1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=094de0edad8d30f9e71ba599d499d69596987afe\n I plan on adding 5G cellular backup at some point, but overall I'm pretty happy with this setup!\n    submitted by    /u/callcifer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found some options on ebay which are listed as PowerEdge M630 through their service tags. Looking at my blades service tags they are reported as: PowerEdge M520 (for PE VRTX). \n I don't know a lot about these VRTX Chassis other than they have some special connectivity and PCIe sharing options.

I'm just adding this to emphasize that I already have the hardware, and all controllers have a decent sized BBU-backed cache.\n The vast majority of the data is stored on Kingston DC series SSDs.\n Recently, I have heard multiple opinions saying that using hardware RAID with non-SAS drives has no benefits.\n Reasons in a nutshell:\n  \nSAS drives have(/had?) 520 byte sectors, so that they can store an 8-byte checksum alongside the 512-byte sector, with SSD drives lacking that, the controller doesn't have a reliable way to detect issues\n most controllers don't use SMART data to predict SSD failure\n it's more difficult to monitor drive failures if the controller hides the physical drives from the OS)\n moderately modern CPUs have no difficulty calculating parity, even at high IO load, and high speeds\n  \nWhat do you think? Are there any benefits to using a hard RAID as opposed to switching the controller to HBA mode and configuring soft RAID provided by the OS (be it MD/LVM in Linux, or Windows with the classic, drive-level RAID or Storage Spaces)?\n    submitted by    /u/OstentatiousOpossum  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to make step forward and begin with virtualization (experiment with pfsense, networking, guacamole, AD, docker, maybe build small NAS). We rent small flat with my girlfriend and we don't have enough place for rack mounted server or even tower server (She said that 😅). I have an idea to buy PC and use it as first server, and I look for advice.\n My requirements:\n - small and silent,\n - not expensive in reference to power consumption,\n - able to run about 3-5 virtual machines simultaneously and some docker containers,\n - allow to build NAS with that. \n Options which I found, all of them fulfill requirements of size to my flat (sorted from the cheapest one):\n 1. HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Tiny i7-6700T (4x2,8-3,6GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 16GB 512GB SSD SATA - only 16GB of RAM and probably need to update from 2x8GB to 2x16GB in the future.\n 2. HP Z240 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 480GB SSD SATA\n 3. Dell OptiPlex 7040 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 500GB SSD NVMe <- think that it would be the most suitable, but I could be wrong :)\n 4. DELL PRECISION T3420 Xeon E3-1240 v5 (4x3,6-3,9Ghz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD NVMe Nvidia Quadro K1200 - unnecessary graphic's card - I think, but Xeon on board.\n 5. HP Z2 MINI G3 Xeon E3-1225 v5 (4x3,3-3,7GHz / 4 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD PCIe Nvidia Quadro M620 2GB GFX - again, unnecessary graphic's card, but I really like design :) \n Thank you in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/ddavid09  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, yeah, another \"Debian vs. Ubuntu\" thread. I'm asking because a lot of the threads I'm finding are many years old where I guess Ubuntu peeved some people and they moved away from them to Debian. I also know that people generally think Debian is more stable but, again, those threads were quite old. I don't really know if thats much the case anymore.\n Right now, I have a mix of Debian and Ubuntu containers in Proxmox but I want to standardize on one. I'm leaning towards Ubuntu Server for one reason: I have no idea why, but apt update and apt upgrade on my Debian containers is painfully slow. I mean, REALLY slow. I've tried everything and just can't figure out why.\n Another reason I'm leaning towards Ubuntu is because of commercial support. Obviously, I don't need commercial support at home but if we start migrating some services at work to Linux (which I think we may), I'm sure management would want to go with the distro that offers support. I'd prefer to use at work what I'm familiar with at home.\n Other than that, is there any other reason I should stick with Debian that I'm missing?\n    submitted by    /u/IndyPilot80  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I decided, I would like to have a little homeserver , again.\n This time, I looked around and I have seen that I only need Plex to be able to run (no transcoding, everything is in 1080p and my upload is 150mbit/s, only 2 people use it)\n The VMs are: DNS and webserver, both only run very little traffic.\n I would love to listen to suggestions, as Synology is horrible priced, I would like to keep this a super small form factor(HP Prodesk g4??? or mac mini (this would be my favourite tbh, but I don't like the fact that I would need to use USB for the 3.5 HDD) \n Then, I have come across used Proliant gen9 servers. I mean, they seem to be percfect. Apart from that they are outdated, I could probably run proxmox or unraid on them, allocate cores and memory properly and completetly avoid using windows (this would be another big point for me) \n Oh and my budget is maximum £250.(used or new) \n On my previous, I ran Windows and I hated it, Windows for me is only for gaming.\n    submitted by    /u/Bolyki  \n [link]   [comments]",

Ideally, I get a pfSense/OPNSense router feeding the switch, but this will have to wait until I can source some well-priced hardware.\n Right now, I only have the router my ISP provided me with. Is it possible to connect a Cisco managed switch to an ISP router? I (at the moment) don't have any other way of providing IP addresses, other than this router which acts as an AP as well as DNS/DHCP server. \n Total newbie - any advice is well received.

In the output I saw I was running \"H\" rather than \"LP\".\n Ran FWUpdLcl.efi -f ME_11.8_Corporate_D0_H_Production.bin to flash the \"H\" firmware\n Rebooted and verified I was running the new AMT version with MeshCommander.\n  \n​\n    submitted by    /u/Joe_Pineapples  \n [link]   [comments]",

MC, DB and PiHole VMs are automatically backed up to my Truenas Box daily.\n The last one running OPNSense. Connecting to it via OpenVPN, because I want to keep my Lab separated from the rest of our network.\n \n  \nI know, cable management, etc... is pretty bad at the moment, but for now, this is just a proof of concept. I've only spent about 80€ so far, 50€ for the rack itself, 20€ for the blank patch panel, and about 10€ for the keystones and cage nuts, I can't really complain. I'm still going to school, so I'm on a pretty tight budget, but I'll do the most out of it.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/zi40xei7615a1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd84ed5fd7042426f7fae1776bccf6cb683c8a43\n    submitted by    /u/Alive-Mulberry2301  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Another day, another problem solved by having a managed switch.\n In one part of the house, video calls, sometimes, drop out a tiny bit here and there—in another part of the house, they are fine. Other Internet usage seems fine in the affected part of the house, so how do you resolve this issue? Well, this can be a bit troublesome to troubleshoot, but, in my case, the managed switch helped track down the culprit pretty fast.\n So, like any good tech guy with a homelab, I SSHed into my trusty switch and looked at the statistics for all the interfaces. Unexpectedly, one of the interfaces was communicating at 100Mbps when it should be 1000Mbps! Since my documentation is good, I quickly noticed that port was one of my Wireless Access Points (WAP). The plot thickens!\n Next, I reviewed the counters for that port and, well, lots of errors and drops on that port! Shouldn’t be happening! So, I proceeded to reseat both ends of the CAT6a cable and returned to my SSH session. Same thing. Still negotiating at a lowly 100Mbps.\n I grab a new CAT6a cable (spare cables are a must for a homelab!), swap the cables out and re-return to my SSH session. 1000Mbps is now correctly being negotiated! After verifying I’m connected to this WAP, I proceed to download a large file. Zero errors and drops on this port! Success! I proceed to have a not too long, but not too short, video call and, well, all is well again!\n Last step is to make absolutely certain the affected cable is in the garbage, so it never gets used again!\n Cheers!\n TL;DR: Invest in a managed switch—you get a lot of advanced functionality and it will save you from future frustrating IT episodes!\n    submitted by    /u/BinkReddit  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have used the QNAP for plex and as my personal cloud storage. I would like to use it for more but the j1800 is pretty limiting. I like to tinker so home automation, plex, moonlight, some form of ad blocker, Linux iso collections and virtual machines to play around with are all on the list of goals for this next machine.\n I was looking towards a lga 1700 based build and was thinking about a i3 12100t. I want to rack mount this little guy inside a silverstone RM41-H08.\n I want to start off efficient but I'm not sure that the T series chips will be worth starting with if eventually I build this out with 8+ spinning disks and a dGPU and 10gig NIC and all of these other power hungry parts.\n I try to build to use for a decade or even potentially longer. I'm just not sure that i won't want to upgrade the cpu sooner than later.\n I would love to hear about your experiences as well as opinions! \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/threepoundog  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been setting up wired network runs at home, and decided to use CAT6, since it's rated for 10G up to 55m, which is well above what I needed. The main network rack is in the garage, and I ran four CAT6 cables from the \"server closet\" on the second story, each about 75ft/23m.\n I have an old storage server (Supermicro SuperStorage 6048R-E1CR24L) with dual Intel X540 NICs. I patched it through to the Mikrotik CRS312 switch, but it only auto-negotiated at 1G. I saw in Winbox that \"10G\" would flash for a brief moment under the list of peer advertised speeds, but it would never stick.\n My server runs SmartOS, an Illumos/Solaris derivative. I searched around to see if anyone else had issues getting 10G working on X540 NICs, and tried some of the suggestions, but nothing has worked so far. I brought the server down to the garage and connected it with a short CAT6 cable, and voila, it negotiated 10G with no problem. I haven't tried another OS yet to see if that might make it work.\n Long-term, though, I don't want to keep the server in the garage, especially come spring and summer. So, long story short, I'm wondering if anyone else has had issues with X540 NICs not being able to negotiate 10G speeds at distances within the CAT6 spec?\n For contrast, I have a Mac Studio in the room with the \"server closet,\" and it negotiates 10G. I tested the speeds with iperf3 between it and the storage server, and it can get ~9.35G one-way. So I don't think there's any interference that would explain this behavior. Although when I run with --bidir, the bandwidth drops to 7.97G and 5.97G; could this indicate something is wrong with the runs, terminations, etc.?\n    submitted by    /u/devopsdudeinthebay  \n [link]   [comments]",

It works as a home computer.\n I have an HPE Proliant Microserver Gen 10 Plus with a Xeon E-2444 3.4GHz w/ 32GB of RAM running Windows Server Standard 2019 with the Windows Server Essentials Experience added. It's basically a file server but I also run a couple of programs remotely using a Remote Desktop app as a poor man's VMWare type arrangement.

It would also get rid of some unnecessary older hardware. Also, since I'm running the server, anyway, it would reduce power consumption.\n When I posted this same question on the s\\intelnuc, I was advised to inquire here.\n Suggestions? Critique?

          "description": "I recently discovered a strange DNS issue with one machine on my home network. From all of my testing in troubleshooting, I am left with the conclusion that the endpoint protection suite (Carbon Black) is tampering with and replacing my DNS results. Let me explain.\n Over the weekend I added pihole to my network in a high availability cluster using keepalived. This essentially creates a virtual IP on my network that can point to any one of 3 machines, depending on their status. On my network, this virtual IP is 192.168.50.30, and I have configured my router to use it for DNS. Testing this on my main Windows 11 machine, and several other Ubuntu and Debian VMs, it works wonderfully without issue.\n My work machine is a different story however. My domain name, lets call it xyz.house is registered with cloudflare. In pihole, I added an A record for pihole.local to 192.168.50.30, and then a CNAME for pihole.internal.xyz.house pointing to pihole.local. When making DNS requests, the local hostname pihole.internal.xyz.house fails to resolve in a very strange way. At least I thought I wasn't resolving because only the hostname was returned; no IP. Then I realized this was only happening hostnames that actually exist externally of pihole. Once I realized this, I tried other domains. Adding google.com as a local A record in pihole, which was likewise ignored. It seemed that my work machine ignores my local DNS results when the hostname is a real hostname registered somewhere else. As if the endpoint protection is trying to avoid DNS spoofing/poisoning. I also realized that the reason I didn't get an IP response, is because there wasn't an A record listed for xyz.house or pihole.internal.xyz.house in cloudflare.\n Has anyone ever heard of this?\n    submitted by    /u/BinaryPatrick  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anytime I’m watching a movie and someone else is on a game server I host we go down.\n I have a spare Dell OptiPlex with 32gb to match my existing one. I was going to try and get myself going on the new one with an Arch ecosystem, but it sort of seems like a good time instead to give k8s a go.

At the moment, the E3-1265l v3 is at 33 dollars on Aliexpress (6168 pts on cpubench) so for those who want to make a HomeLab for cheap, the TinyMiniMicro in socket 1150 have the best value for money because above, the Xeon processors do not work anymore and the price is much higher.\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/v7464p3tfq4a1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6dd548239c0936d7d7d42262f95cefd4f426ed3a\n    submitted by    /u/sussudio45  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I recently built a new tool to do some devops work in my home lab, which was initially intended to be a more \"advanced\" exec handler for serf so I could more effectively change backend vm's of my custom load balancer among other things. What I quickly realized was that it was way simpler and easier to use than ansible / chef etc, especially for golang apps where I just needed to drop a binary set up a user and create a systemd unit file with a template, then start the service on an lxc container.\n Some of the key things that make it useful for me is to secure bootstrap of new instances (cloud init) or (golden images), as I can dynamically provision based on instance id/hostname/ip which is locked to particular s3 prefix(or minio), which means I don't need any external inbound requests to the server to provision at all and changing install is as simple as just terminating instance / updating s3 config. It does still function well for serf too though as an exec handler and I now use it as both os installer and exec handler, that first sets up nginx but also can take the members in the serf role and quickly update nginx config + HUP nginx with new members as example.\n The templating uses go templates but variable injection can be done either by providing a preset value or by running a command inline, so you can use hostname -f of the live system to feed a template var. Second to that I built in os limits, so in the same file you can run 2 cmd executions but limit one to ubuntu or specifically ubuntu:20.04 and the other for redhat... This was required for things like installing bind tools which has different package names between the OS's \n Right now there is an nginx install example but I might create a simple one for home assistant and magic mirror etc, with module updates.\n Either way would love some feedback: https://github.com/Nitecon/bruce\n    submitted by    /u/WillTheHatt  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would be fine for me to keep the body of the thing, but I would've thought I could upgrade the motherboard and chip, possibly power supply. However, I'm not at all a PC build expert, so don't have much of an idea what the best deals are.\n I'd be looking for excellent bang-for-buck, that should be significantly better than what I already have, but for minimal cost. The thing cost me only something like €250 when I got it, after all.\n Specs:\n  \nMotherboard Dell VD5HY: https://www.itcreations.com/product/84192\n CPU: Xeon(R) CPU E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz \n Having Intel QuickSync for Plex seems to be quite desirable?\n \n Currently 16GB ram.

So, from my research online it shows that I need to:\n For Wireless:\n Create multiple SSIDs with VLAN IDs on them then mark a port as Trunk on the switch with all the VLAN IDs that were assigned to SSIDs. At the end just plug in the Wireless Access Point to that specific trunk port on the switch. Of course, the main appliance that acts as a router\\firewall needs to have set VLANs in its configuration as well.\n For LAN:\n For the LAN I just configure a VLAN ID and a port on the switch itself to which I then plug a RJ45 cable into. Also, the router\\firewall appliance has its own configuration for LAN VLANs.\n Is this how I should go about setting up VLANs or am I missing something here ?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Tickle_My_Brain  \n [link]   [comments]",

Dell Optiplex, HP elitedesk, lenovo mxxx... \n I'd like to build a simple router on a small PC, obviously it will need at least two NIC. \n Someone from here showed me the Lenovo M720q, which can handle a i350 4x NIC on a PCIe entry. But currently I only find some pricey ones, and the i350 mod also costs a little. Around +300€ in total, not really worth it for a no wifi router (i'll think about getting a wifi access point later on).\n It's hard to say if other brands can do the same, they do have optional rear ports (vga / hdmi / rs232), but i'm not sure those places could host a NIC from there. I'm thinking of some Dell Optiplex, actually I can get a 3070 for a decent price but without this multi NIC capability i'm not motivated to buy it. It does have a empty \"cross\" at the back (if no optional port there) but I really don't know how to profit from it. \n Has some of you used a small factor PC to turn into a multi NIC router ? If yes could you point me some models, tips or anything of help. \n Thanks a lot !\n    submitted by    /u/ShiningPak  \n [link]   [comments]",

They just released mDNS, which is what I’ve been holding out for. I see they are releasing a 10GB router, which would directly compete with the UDM platform.

          "description": "Hey Folks,\n So I am working on upgrading my hardware, mostly my TrueNAS and Proxmox servers. I've been running my plex container directly on my TrueNAS server (an old octocore phenom amd cpu) to give it direct access to storage, this has worked well for me, but now I am considering some other options during this upgrade process.\n My new servers will be dual xeons with 22 cores on each CPU. I know this is far overkill for TrueNAS, so I started thinking, maybe I should keep truenas on the octocore and create a VM with access to the storage on the truenas over my back end network. I'm going to be using teamed 4 port gigabit nics on each of the servers I am building to provide good network thruput to my vm hosts from TrueNas where the VM disks will be stored\n If I put the docker container in a VM and host it on proxmox over the network, do you think I will get similar performance over the VM as I would directly on the truenas box?\n Really the question is, do I want to waste(?) all that CPU power on truenas with some docker containers, or host it in a VM and be able to throw as many cores/memory at it as I want and leave the truenas server on the octocore phenom? This will let me use the 2 xeon systems I am building strcitly as proxmox servers and leave the lower end box as just a nas instead of nas and docker.\n I hope this makes sense, my thinking feels a bit scattered, but I think I got my point across\n Any advice would be appreciated!\n Thanks!~Rick\n    submitted by    /u/RickoT  \n [link]   [comments]",

It came with 2.15.10.10 and is now 2.83.83.83 and BIOS is 2.16.0. Due to habit from the R720s I stepped it up with every major release until current. ie 2.40.40.40 to 2.50.50.50. iDRAC was reset once current.\n running radadm via SSH shows the following and I already did the 3 settings to try and cut it down.\n /admin1-> racadm get system.thermalsettings\n [Key=system.Embedded.1#ThermalSettings.1]\n AirExhaustTemp=70\n #FanSpeedHighOffsetVal=71\n #FanSpeedLowOffsetVal=23\n #FanSpeedMaxOffsetVal=100\n #FanSpeedMediumOffsetVal=48\n FanSpeedOffset=Off\n #MFSMaximumLimit=100\n #MFSMinimumLimit=31\n MinimumFanSpeed=255\n ThermalProfile=Minimum Power\n ThirdPartyPCIFanResponse=Disabled\n Doing F2 then iDRAC then thermal ( think it was) I can set the fan min via a custom but 31 is the lowest it will let me.

          "description": "I bought this server hoping to move my unraid setup over to it. Not knowing much about enterprise server setup, I see I am running into issues. I am now aware of the raid controls on these servers. It has the Adaptec 5808 hba, which apparently can be flashed into IT mode to passthrough the HDDs. The drives on the onboard raid control can sometimes be seen by unraid but are showing as different drives than what the array was. My question, would it just be easier to just buy a compatable hba card for both of the backplanes? Will it then be just plug and play as if i was just moving the array to another PC? Also, Would any limitations of storage capacity be on the hba card or the backplane end? Most of my HDDs are currently 4tb but looking to upgrade to 6 or 8tb per drive. I am looking for the best way to move drives and be seen by Unraid with no new configuration. I can move the array from one pc to the next no problems. Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/QuaiTheDragon  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't need large capacities. 1-2-4 TB is more than I would possibly ever need. This will be running on ZFS, I guess as a mirror.\n So the question - what should I pursue? The used DC drives? New ones? Optane? Or may be this is a viable option: https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-M-2-U-2-Adapter-SFF-8639/dp/B073W65QX6\n or this: https://www.amazon.com/ICY-DOCK-Tool-Less-SFF-8639-Converter/dp/B07T8LJY23\n An adapter for the M.2. That last option looks tempting, since M.2 drives are getting real cheap. PCIe 3.0 in particular.\n Or am I completely on a wrong track and there is a better way to enjoy the NVMe?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/sergedubovsky  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently have installed there a PDU, ethernet switch, router and power injector for internet access ODU installed on the roof of my house. On the bottom there is a plastic pipe (that goes under the ground to the street) where fiber would be placed in the future. In near future I plan to install also NVR for cameras and NAS for storage.\n ​\n Since I'm working remotely from home, I need backup power supply in case of power outage, that happens from time to time for couple of minutes. It is a problem when you are providing training online for bunch of people and network goes down :). I was looking for 10\" rack AC UPS, but there are none on the market. I was looking for modular UPS with external battery, but none for 10\" rack.\n ​\n Since all my current and future devices are DC powered I've decided to use buffer switch mode power supply unit. There are sockets for 230V AC input, 12V DC output, connectors for battery. Battery can perfectly fit at the bottom of the shelf where I had a free space (next to this pipe for fiber). PSU fits in standard 10\" rack 1U shelf with extra metal sheet wall in the front (custom build). I've installed also status LEDs that shows status of AC input, DC output, battery charge. I've installed fuse module with 4 outputs, so each of my devices have own fuse. One of devices works only with 9V, so I've installed also DC/DC converter from 12V to 9V. I've selected 12V 9Ah battery and set 1A charging current.\n ​\n Currently my devices consume at most in total 15W, so 9Ah battery is enough for 7h+. After I add planned devices it will increase to 45W, so battery would keep devices on for ~2h 30min. I plan to replace then a battery with bigger one.\n ​\n Here are some photos.\n Power supply for my 10\\\" rack\n ​\n Battery I've used\n ​\n How it looks before installation\n ​\n Houw it looks after installation\n Inside\n ​\n This is how it looks currently, free space is for future devices.\n    submitted by    /u/ThatsMyUsernameDear  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the time, those were the Netgear Nighthawk R9000 and Asus PCE-AC88 respectively. In 2022, there is still nothing better than that Asus for 4x4 MIMO.\n Anyway, it all started very simple.

I'm trying to figure out the smartest approach to some sort of gateway/reverse proxy that will shove all requests (along with their ports) for a given server address to an internal address.

I've heard good things about APC, but I've also heard that their newer models aren't really all that great. I've heard good things about Eaton, and so far I don't see many people complaining about them. To my knowledge their UPS's are also more common than APC's in enterprises and shit.\n Can y'all help me decide? I don't need something that big since I'll mainly be using it to provide a graceful shutdown for my NAS and keep it running if the power flickers. Both of the UPS's that I'm looking at are in my price range, and my main concern is buying one that has less of a chance of catching on fire.\n    submitted by    /u/Windows_XP2  \n [link]   [comments]",

GPU solid (GUI/Desktop performance more than enough, actually quite good) \n Currently running:\n SSH Server Pi-hole Pi-VPN Samba Sonarr Radarr Docker, and Transmission. \n Once configured for my LAN (used desktop GUI connected to a monitor with keyboard & mouse and a bit of SSH), it only needs the psu connected before logging in via SSH - GUI/Display output still working incase its needed though. \n The power draw/cpu usage while idling are very low and even with all of those services running in the background - ram usage 815mb out of 3973Mb and System load of 5%. The best part for me is the power draw, which sits idle at about 4-5W. \n I have photos of resource usage - neofetch, htop and the info given when logging in to the terminal - I'll make an imgur album if there's enough interest :) \n It's taken me the best part of this weekend to do this - if there is enough interest let me know and I'll get some up on r/homelabsales if that's something that's allowed. \n Thanks for reading 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/CrystalFeeler  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently run an entry level Netgear ReadyNAS which is approaching near 10yrs old and is mainly used for \"cold storage\" and an i3 NUC as my mini-server / media centre, again that's nearing 10 yrs. I've had both from new and they have been brilliant but the media centre is starting to play up and I'm thinking it about time I start thinking about changing both into one combined machine with new drives. \n My needs are not that heavy but ideally I would like to go down the TrueNAS Scale route with a 4U, 4-8HDD hot swap, short server style setup but I'm really struggling to put a decent combination of HW together to match the value for money of the QNAP TS-473A which would also meet my needs. \n Further there is space, noise and consumption challenges with the server compares to the QNAP which further add to the cost to compensate. I don't know if the server style approach is more romantic than reality and if I should just bite the bullet with the QNAP and call it a day (despite my reservations on their poor poor security record). \n My best HW combination so far is as below to keep the NAS under £900 (excl HDDs/SSDs):\n Motherboard: Asrock X570 Pro 4 - £170\n CPU - Ryzen 5 Pro 5650G - £150\n Memory - 32GB ECC - £150\n Server Case - 4U - £190\n PSU - Crosair - 550W - £100\n Various Noctua Fans + Ancilliaries - £120 \n ​\n In comparison the QNAP comes in at £750 + £100 for a RAM upgrade to 32GB ECC. Granted the server is a little more powerful but has other complexities...\n What HW would you go with to justify the server over the QNAP?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/rediduser  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ll also use it for some movie streaming and encoding.\n I’d prefer Nvidia for the software compatibility but it doesn't have to be. I need it to at least match the gaming performance of an RTX 2070. It also has to fit in a r730xd so it can’t be super massive. I can use server GPUs or consumer GPUs. If it’s a consumer GPU I believe it has to be a blower model (that pushes air out the back).\n I’m having trouble deciphering the nvidia server GPU naming scheme, and there are minimal user benchmarks submitted for server GPUs so I really have no idea what I’m looking at. From other posts I've read it sounds like server GPUs aren't great for gaming. But used parts can be at such large discounts that it may be worth it, I don't know.\n If anyone can recommend me a good GPU that fits in an R730/R730XD I would appreciate it.\n    submitted by    /u/AwefulUsername  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So this is kind of a generic question, but I'm seeking advice for best way to secure a VPS (recently picked up a pretty beefy VPS for cheap on cyber monday). \n So the issue I am running into is that when you install docker and deploy an image with the -p option, it's creating a related rule in nftables (running Debian 11). My original plan was to throw down ufw, forward only 80/443 and reverse proxy things I wanted publicly exposed (very little), and everything else would only accessible via wireguard. \n I setup wireguard, got that working and everything then deployed a syncthing docker (to backup certain files from an on-prem box). I didn't create a rule in ufw for the UI, yet I was able to browse to it and that's when I starting researching and learned that -p option was creating those nft rules. This is not what I want; I want the syncthing UI to only be available to my clients connected to this VPS with wireguard, but I'm not sure how to achieve this. \n Any suggestions? How are you running dockers on a VPS without exposing it all on the internet?\n    submitted by    /u/devianteng  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "​\n So I got my new to me S3500 switches. They came with a single 1050w power supply. \n That thing is LOUD! I mean, I run older R710s and that noise is ok. Some of you prefer dead silent and that's ok, but I personally don't mind a bit of background white noise. \n But these 1050s are on another level! My first thought was to fan mod it, but with the amount of heat coming out of that thing even with the switch idle makes me think it would overheat rather rapidly. The main fans in the switch slow down considerably after boot and they don't seem too bad. Of course, I can't really tell for sure with the PSU fan blasting away. \n So looking around it looks like Aruba specified both 600w and 1050w power supplies for this switch. I have also seen mention of 350w power supplies in a couple of posts. However they don't appear in the datasheet for the S3500 so my assumption is they don't have enough power output.\n So for those of you that have run S3500s, is the 600w PSU a lot quieter than the 1050?\n    submitted by    /u/Radius118  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been tearing my hair out for a few weeks trying to figure out exactly how to control the fans on these things; there's a lot of people out there with instructions on how to generically control fans on SMC servers with ipmitool and some people have details for X9 boards. In particular this STH article/discussion was very helpful indeed.\n ​\n I do think it's worth reading that comment and the original reference guide so I won't go into detail here, but what I did want to add was that the 1027GR seems to have unusual ID's for its zones. Specifically everyone usually says that the CPU zone is 0x00 and any additional cooling zones are 0x01, 0x02, etc. but on this server, (or at least mine) the zones aren't that at all. The zones for controlling the fans on my 1027GR-TR are the following:\n  \n0x10: CPU Zone\n 0x12: Left GPU Zone\n 0x13: Right GPU Zone\n  \nI know it's not the most useful post but I just wanted this to be out there for the next person searching around.

This often includes setting up new laptops, PCs etc. as well as installing software on those devices.\n After setting up yet another laptop, I've had the idea of creating a small solution to be able to: 1. Install new devices from an image I created 2. Install software remotely 3. Remotely connecting to the devices when my \"users\" need help with anything that requires me to see their screen.\n I'm already pretty set on using AnyDesk for #3, but I haven't yet found a clean, easy (and free/inexpensive) solution for the first two points.

When I do this however, I can't access the switch or AP because I don't have an Ethernet port to route through the switch. It does broadcast an SSID but I have no clue what the password is. To get around this, I setup [Modem > Router > Switch > AP], setup a Unifi Console and got everything working. I then tried to remove the router with the now configured OS console, but when I do this it continues broadcasting the SSID I setup and the password is correct, but it won't let me connect back to the AP unless I have the router plugged in. It just says it's connected, obtaining IP, then disconnects like it was never even trying (Android).

I’ve built computers in the past and have some technical knowledge, but nothing compared to this community. So, here’s what I’m looking to do:\n  \nNAS - I’m a video editor by trade, mostly 4K. I want a 100+ TB NAS to house archive files, and/or working files (if possible). I will hardwire my workstation to the NAS.\n PleX - I have a small-sized (<50) digital blu-ray collection and other digital movies in compressed formats that I’d like to house on my server and give access to close friends and family. <5 streams at once. Yes to hardware encoding.\n Experimentation - As this is my first introduction to all of this, I’d love to experiment with things like Radarr, Sonarr, home automation, Pi-hole, and I’m sure other things in the future.\n  \nThe hardware I've picked out can be found here or outlined below:\n ​\n  \n CPU Intel Core i5-11400 \n  \n Motherboard Gigabyte Z590 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA 1200 \n  Memory G.Skill Aegis 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-2666 \n  Power Supply Corsair RM550x (2021) 550W 80+ Gold \n  Tiered Cache Storage (2X) TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB M.2 \n  OS Drive Kingston NV2 500GB M.2 \n  Storage Drives Seagate IronWolf Pro 18TB 7200 RPM (or 20TB depending on prices at time of purchase) \n \n    submitted by    /u/Mike-Anto  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I can't add anything too crazy and it has to be under 75W, but after watching a video by Craft Computing talking about the Tesla P4 I thought it would be a perfect fit for this server. Also they are really cheap right now compared to what they were a few months ago. \n Since I'm still new, and this is my first time ever doing anything like this, I wanted some advice before I purchased anything. Is it a good idea to go with the Tesla P4 or should I use something else? Is there anything in addition to the GPU that I would need to purchase? I know I might need a fan for cooling, but is there something I might be forgetting? Also does anyone have this setup? Would it even be possible?

          "description": "Real basic question I hope someone can answer for me to save me the buttload of time it would take to find out myself through experimentation...\n If you have a Dell server (e.g. R520) with an on-board RAID controller for the backplane, and the RAID controller does not support non-RAID configurations... \n If you, as a workaround, were to set up each disk as a single RAID0 virtual disk individually, and pass the RAID0 VDs through to the OS, would the Filesystem on the physical disk remain mountable if later removed from the RAID controller?\n In other words: does the RAID controller do anything to the structure of the disk such that it can only be mounted by the RAID controller, or would it be identical to the same disk mounted by a SAS controller without RAID?\n I'm looking to use this workaround to mount disks to pass through to a guest OS, and want to ensure that I am not dependent on the continued operation of the host RAID controller to access and work with the data, so that if/when the host controller dies or is replaced with another device, I can just plug the drives in to another SAS controller and have them be recognized and mounted normally.\n Thanks in advance.\n P.S. if I don't get an answer here I'll need to verify it myself by several passes of formatting and mounting and OSing and swapping 10TB disks between servers so that could take a while.... I'll post the results here if I do though because I'm not a monster.\n    submitted by    /u/SimplifyAndAddCoffee  \n [link]   [comments]",

Indeed, I had figured out how to make this whole thing work before things broke after a power outage and I had to do my workaround again.\n I have two UAP-AC-HD APs and one UAP-AC-Pro. The Pro has no issues - I connect it to the switch, tell it to turn POE on, and it's immediately detected as 802.3af. Obviously also works fine with an injector. However, both of the HDs - when the AP has been disconnected for a while (e.g. 5 hour power outage), when it's connected to the switch, it's detected as \"non-standard PD\". When I connect it to an 802.3at injector, it turns on fine.\n Here's the strange thing - if I have it on the injector for a little bit of time (~5 minutes or so) then immediately plug it into the switch directly, the switch senses it as 802.3at and feeds it power.\n Has anyone run into this before? Or does this sound familiar to anyone?\n    submitted by    /u/misteryub  \n [link]   [comments]",

Last night we had a very close lightning strike. \n The surge travelled through the ground. Into an unplugged coax cable outside. Through that cable and into an AP inside. Through that AP and into my Cat5e cables. Through those cables and killed my 24 port managed switch. It may have also damaged the NIC on one of my servers.\n This is my current theory at least.\n It is also a good idea to backup your switch configs to a remote server.

I have a mini ASRock PC with an i7-1100K with 2x 1TB NVME SSD's running Unraid for all of my dockers (plex) & VMs. I like Unraid for that.\n ​\n I purchased a 10gbe switch and am evaluating what to do with my setup to use at least 2.5gbe on my NAS and primary workstation.\n ​\n  \nBuild a cheap AMD Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 ATX tower and put in my 14TB HDDs (3 are in my DS918+ and I have 2 extra) and 32GB of ECC RAM and run TrueNAS or Xpenology and setup shares. Keep using my little i7 unraid box for VMs & docker (plex). I'd do 3 or 4 HDDS to start in Z1. I can add another array in the future? I'm a TrueNAS noob.\n Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Unraid for everything. No ECC RAM though with the i7... Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. Only concern is will I have issues with bitrot on Unraid vs. ZFS or Synology SHR.\n Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Proxmox and setup TrueNAS as a VM and run my Win & Linux VMs to proxmox. Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. \n Buy a 5-bay DS1522+ use 4x14TB HDDs, 1x14TB HDD as a hotswap. Add their overpriced 10gbe card. Keep using it as my file shares, use Hyperbackup to other offsite DS220 and cloud backup to GDrive. Keep my mini i7 Unraid box. Sell my DS918+ to recoup some of the expense of new one.\n  \nI do like how easy Synology makes things (love Hyperbackup). I use their quickconnect feature and OpenVPN to access it remotely. For accessing my Unraid remotely I use Tailscale. If I used TrueNAS, what do they offer for easy offsite backups and syncing to google drive?\n ​\n I have a short depth server rack so I can't use any full size servers. An ATX tower I would set on the floor. It's all in a 5x5 closet, no ventilation. So I do have to consider heat. Currently the Synology HDDs run 37-40C.\n ​\n Any feedback appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/wildmn  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I realize this questions gets thrown around a lot, but here I am asking again as I wasn't happy with the specifics per the other posts I came across. Perhaps a sticky/reference list of all the more common SFP+ modules, their release date, compatability with things like ESXi, general performance expecations, costs, ect.\n In my particular case, I've got a new R450 that I'll be using with Hyper-V on a slightly older T440 Hyper-V host. I'd like to setup replication between them and the backups we are creating could also use some wider bandwidth than 1gb NICs (no LAG, avoiding it). The new R450 came with a Broadcom dual SFP+. I'd be using 1 SFP+ via a DAC back to our UniFi Pro switch and I was thinking of creating a direct connection between the two hosts with SFP+ and a DAC cable. Making this purely for replication of our multiple VMs and virtual workstations, preventing this traffic from even having to touch our switches.\n The Intel x520-DA2 all seem long in the tooth and picky about modules, and the newer x710 even more so. Is there another solid option for dual SFP+ modules that play nice with Dell Servers (T440)?\n    submitted by    /u/Pr0t0c01s  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's got:\n 2x E5-2630v2, 128GB DDR3, 8x 3.5\", Perc H310 Mini, and an idrac express.\n So, overkill for home use, but hey, why not right!?\n ​\n So first I'm going ot make sure I'm all up do date with the firmware and things. Anything else I should do before getting started (like upgrading to a certain level of firmware and not all the way?)\n ​\n After that is done, on to installing more hardware. So far I've got 2x 8TB Ironwolfs and 6x 2TB Dell Enterprise drives to go in the front. Was thinking I'd make one raidz2 of the 6x 2TB drives for the data storage and home backups (and use something like backblaze or google archive for offsite backup of this) and then for the two 8TB, just leave as two disks for media use for plex (don't mind if i lose media, can always redownload (1GB connection FTW!)).\n ​\n As for the OS and LXCs and VMs, since all the front bay drives will be full, I'm thinking I'll order in 2x Samsung 980 250GB and 2x PCIe nvme adapter cards. Hopefully I can use the clover bootloader method to boot off of a internal USB stick that points to the mirrored nvme cards(?)\n ​\n From there I'm thinking I'll use proxmox as my base OS and have a bunch of LXC and VMs. Currently looking to hadware pass the drives to TrueNAS and have that be the main arbiter of disk space. Any ideas if this is a good way to go? \n ​\n I'll also be installing your usual home media things: Plex, Sonarr, Jackett, Deluge, etc.\n ​\n Along with some things like pihole, are there any other great bits of kit I should be looking at installing? Will look at getting a server nVidia GFX card for transcoding/mining/stable diffusion etc. Any ones I should look for/stay away from?\n    submitted by    /u/Fienx  \n [link]   [comments]",

My M630 has a QLogic converged NIC with BCM57810 which according to this document has \"Offloaded full HBA functionality iSCSI initiator\". To me that means I should be able to mount a target and have it visible to the OS for install. (Maybe I'm wrong here?) I have configured the card in BIOS, and sometimes I can see the card connect to the target, sometimes it doesn't. Anytime it tries it says the connection succeeded though.

I need minimum 8 3.5\" HDD bays for my NAS, though 12 would be ideal. As for the other equipment, I plan to use an unmanaged network switch and a UPS with a maximum depth of about 16 inches.\n When I look around for rack-mount PC cases or chassis, most of them are at least 27 inches deep, which would extend the overall footprint of the rack by quite a bit. I am aiming for low power consumption and don't need a ton of VMs, so I am considering a microATX motherboard or similar small footprint. I see a handful of shallow-depth chassis or cases out there but none of them seem have enough HDD bays.\n My question is: Are there any shallow depth rack cases/chassis out there with at least 8 HDD bays?

          "description": "Hi there. I have had 2 different lab setups I did in the past at home. However I have never really done anything involving switches... it was always tinkering with and connecting up DD-WRT flashed routers and really old computers I had acquired when I was doing computer repair. We have an issue at the small office of 7 employees that I was hoping I could receive some help on. This may not be appropriate to ask here, but /r/networking seemed like it was more of a place for enterprise level stuff, and this subreddit seems to be a place for home networking. My problem falls kinda in between. \n At my new job we have a bit of a mess in terms of a \"network\"... Lots of ethernet cables ran all over the building to offices that aren't used anymore. We have 2 people using USB Wifi Dongles to connect wireless to the router and the rest of the computers are hardwired between two switches. We also have an old server that is not being utilized. Folks that are hardwired to the switches can't Samba share to anyone not hooked up to the same switch. \n I have a network cable tester and tracer coming in the mail Thursday. I figure that is probably step 1 in trying to find out what is going on since nothing is labeled anywhere. What I'm hoping to achieve is to do minimal wire runs and configuration to allow for all of us in the office to be able to communicate via Samba and set up a way for automatic backups to be done on the old server that is not in use.\n It seems to me that connecting the switches together through a simple configuration might would solve these problems. A very basic overview of networking basics seems like where I need to start. I'm hoping to not have to dive too deep and eat up too much time. If anyone has a good link or resource for me, it would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/CountryFriedAlive  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since it came later, I never bothered with moving my system onto the Chembro, so the chassis is only being used for disks, and a different chassis hosts the system, which is connected to the disks via an external SAS cable. \n Things have been working alright, but now I want to expand. I've been eying a Supermicro SC847 chassis with capacity for 36 disks. I'll likely replace the 24-disk chassis with this one. I could also look into moving the system onto this same chassis, but I'm concerned about heat. If I were to keep the disks separate, is a chassis like the 847 the best solution? Are there any \"disk only\" chassis out there that would allow me to connect my system to this array?

          "description": "Hey homelab, I've recently needed some additional storage and thought it was time to hack together a NAS to last me a few years until I have the budget for something nicer. Digging into my spare parts box, I managed to find four 1 TB HDDs (two internal drives and two old externals that are not in use) as well as a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB). \n I was thinking of somehow connecting these together and have the Pi control them. Three of the drives would host media/documents and the fourth would work as a backup of just the most critical files. Should I set these in some sort of RAID array? \n In terms of hardware, I've seen some four-bay HDD enclosures/docks such as these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2WRB97\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L7PSWV9\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUSU8MI\n Would this be sufficient for my needs and do I need to purchase anything else? Alternatively I have an old tower with a water-damaged motherboard that I could chuck everything into if that's a better option.\n My other questions were with regards to the OS. I'm really only looking to set up Jellyfin and Vaultwarden via Docker. Is it worth considering a NAS distro such as OMV or TrueNAS? Or should I just go with Raspbian and create a SMB share? It's only me using this and I don't plan to configure anything fancy so I'm leaning towards the latter...\n Appreciate any feedback and advice, thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AltruisticLoss1078  \n [link]   [comments]",

You know all that hardware you carefully curated to work with me? as of this release I now support none of it! Enjoy the upgrade!)\n - Hyper-V Server (You can create virtual machines after you domain join me. Oh...you have no domain? Ok, I can still work, once you set up constrained delegation....and the default client config doesn't work without modifications...and I no longer support the out-of-box cypher suites without several config settings...you sure you don't have a domain?)\n - ProxMox (Wanna buy a license? Wanna buy a license? How about a license? Hey, sexy mama...wanna buy a ProxMox license?)\n - OpenStack (Have you got 14 extra server chassis lying around? Good. Let's begin)\n - and KVM (Welcome to the command line! The default setup does almost but not quite what you, personally want. Enjoy these twenty copy/pasted blog posts and have fun with these command line tools with 400 different settings!)\n That was all fun for awhile, but I'm wanting to use my home lab and not just rebuild it endlessly (and yes, I wanted to rebuild it endlessly....that was part of the fun).

My apologies if I can't ask here.\n Don't have much to work with, just a Fios G3100 router and Windows Server 2016 running on an Unraid box. My understanding is that Windows Server needs to also run DHCP server to also be a Domain Controller. Won't this conflict with my Fios router or it all depends on where I set up the DHCP server on the Fios router that would be the primary choice when devices connect to the network?\n ​\n  \nIf i had to make the Windows Server the primary router, what would happen if the Windows Server goes offline?\n Or would I be better off making the Fios router range 2-200 and then set the range on WInServer to 202-240? and then manually setting the default Gateway (on the devices that'll be connecting to the domain) to the WinServer? \n Is the right strategy to just put the Windows Server on its own subnet, like what do y'all do?

I am looking for two cases, one to transfer my NAS into so it should have a few drive bays I've seen quite a few online and I'm pretty happy with some of them, but I'm also considering putting my PC into the rack as well so that I have ample space on my desk. So I have a couple of questions regarding this:\n  \nThe case, I see a lot of server cases but they all have lots of HDD slots and are kind of overkill from what I can see, maybe I should be looking for a 2U or 3U for a PC case. I would like to make sure I can fit whatever available GPU I have and maybe some things like NIC cards or other pcie devices and don't want to end up restricted. I'd be inserting a regular ATX motherboard.\n \nWill this work? I want to have some kind of small type c device on my desk that will deal with monitors mouse etc connecting back to the server rack (same room not too far) and maybe even type c powered monitors for a very minimal cabling job.\n \n I keep getting caught in a googling loop with type c docking stations when I look for devices that essentially just give me all the ports I'd need over type c so maybe someone has a better idea of what these are called.\n    submitted by    /u/reddddddddddditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has the external 68 pin connector which goes to the external drive, as well as another 68 pin inside along with a 50 pin scsi connector. I'm not sure what these are for, presumably data is transferred through the PCI part. I'm guessing there is some sort of PCI jumper but I'm not sure what to look for. \n After that, I have no idea what sort of software to use.

My internet comes in trough the router I got from my ISP, to which I have connected a separate pfsense firewall and my server is connected to that. Ports 80 and 443 are forwarded on both my ISP router (to the address of the firewall) and the firewall (to the address of my server).\n ​\n I have bought a domain and directed the name to my public ip address using an A record. This works, because I can forward a port (for example 5555) and access it from outside using www.mydomain.com:5555. However, when I try to access just the domain through the NGINX reverse proxy, it doesn't work. When I try to connect to the reverse proxy from inside my network (by just accessing www.mydomain.com) I get sent to the login page of my router. My router doesn't use CGNAT (I think) because when I traceroute my public IP it only takes 1 hop:\n traceroute to my.public.ip (my.public.ip), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 my.public.ip (my.public.ip) 100.108 ms 100.062 ms 100.769 ms \n My nginx/sites-available/default file looks like this:\n server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; proxy_http_version 1.1; } } \n I have also added the host in my /etc/hosts file. I found that the second line was already there, where it connected 127.0.1.1 to the hostname of my server (I don't know if that is correct or I should remove it). the file is this:\n 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname my.public.ip www.mydomain.com \n The server I want to connect to my reverse proxy is a nodejs server running on address 127.0.0.1 with port 8000. I have allowed NGINX on my firewall:\n Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- Nginx Full ALLOW Anywhere Nginx Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) \n Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/sem-tex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will transfer new content to the server, process it into proxies, and send it to the laptop. This will all be controlled by RDP from the laptop.

          "description": "Hi, I have a Linux box that runs 3 pairs of 4 TB disks, each pair set to RAID1 with the Linux software RAID (mdadm). I'd like to convert them to a single ZFS pool with 2 parity disks without losing the data in the process, to make it easy to upgrade in the future and to gain extra capacity (would jump from 11 TB to about 15).\n 1st question is about the conversion. I'm planning to degrade all three RAID1 arrays to a single disk and use the freed disks to initialize a RAIDz2. I would copy over the files from the first RAID1 array then add the remaining disk of that array to the ZFS pool. Then repeat for the other two arrays.\n Is this doable? It's not clear to me if ZFS will let me start a RAIDz2 with only 3 disks... If I have to start with RAIDz1 can I convert it to RAIDz2 later \"live\"?\n 2nd question is about ZFS portability. What I like about mdadm is that you can install any Linux distro and it will pick up the existing arrays right away, they aren't \"tied\" in any way to a specific driver or hardware. Is ZFS the same? If I create a pool on one distro and then switch to a completely different one (or dual-boot) will the other one pick up the ZFS pool without a hitch?\n TIA for any insight.\n    submitted by    /u/GolemancerVekk  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.\n Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.\n How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.\n Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE?

I am looking to create a home media server that might be capable of some other things like ad blocking or running a VPN (I'm interested in exploring containerization later as well). With the equipment I have already where would I be best suited to look for instructions on how to go about accomplishing my goals and is there a better way of doing it? \n Equipment thus far:\n - RaspberryPi 4B with 2GB in a starter kit (with power supply)[I wanted to try to make a Pi cluster]. https://www.pishop.ca/product/raspberry-pi-4b-starter-kit/\n - refurbished Lenovo ThinkCentre M73 Tiny Desktop (Intel G3250T 2.8GHz,128GB SSD, 8GB, WIFI)\n - Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Plus Switch\n I also have 2 older (from 2009 & 2013) MacBook pros I have been slowly upgrading [batteries, memory, RAM where possible] in the hopes of using them to be my media servers but I am having issues sourcing some parts.\n I do have some experience with virtual machines (VM Ware) and Ubuntu/Linux) if that helps.\n Any information would be greatly appreciated, thanks again for reading.\n ​\n tl;dr: Point me (beginner) in the direction of information on how to build a home media server with the equipment I have or suggest some additional equipment. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Samsquatcherous  \n [link]   [comments]",

Has it been mitigated if you're running the latest version of Linux for example? \n What about hyperthreading/SMT? It feels like yesterday where everyone was freaking out that hyperthreading got busted wide open and the only way to be safe is to completely disable it (particularly on Intel CPUs). Gas that been mitigated or is it still a bad idea to run hyperthreading on older CPUs?\n It feels like everyone was freaking out that the sky was falling after Spectre and Meltdown was discovered, how we've been plunged back into the age where just loading the wrong webpage can get your online banking info stolen, and then abruptly stopped talking about it a few months later.

It appears they were custom built from Canadian company for audio production.\n All of them are using iStarUSA D-300 3U rackmount chassis with C2D setup with some special audio capture and ASUS GeForce 8400 GS Fanless cards. I decided remove all existing hardware components in the servers because their motherboard and PSU are dead due to leaked capacitors. I gave away one of them to my friend.\n Then, I installed two servers chassis with old and. new hardwares I have:\n  \n Chinese X99 board with Xeon E5-2640 v3, 32GB DDR4 ECC REG, and 12TB (4x3TB SAS HDD) RAID setup. It is currently running Unraid.\n  Supermicro X79 dual socket board with two Xeon E5-2620 v2, 64GB DRR3 ECC REG, and 500GB SSD SATA. It is currently running Proxmox.\n  \nNow, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?\n P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.\n P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports.

Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. \n I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. \n The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. \n My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. \n After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. \n I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. \n Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?\n Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. \n If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. \n My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Zeb_ra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't know if I'd really call it LabPorn but hey...\n From top to bottom:\n -2x cat6 patch panels to keep things \"tidy\" in the front\n -1x USW48 Pro for all my 1Gb switching needs\n -1x Mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ for iSCSI + backups\n -1x old Supermicro 1U server I got used with a Xeon E3-1220 V2 and 32Gb of ram that runs my opensense box (I really don't like virtualized firewalls, too risky)\n -1x QNAP TS453-BU NAS with 2 Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 2x IronWolf 8TB for backups\n -1x QNAP TS1886-XU NAS with 4x Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 4x Exos 18TB for storage\n -2x Dell R630 I got for free at work running a proxmox Cluster with plenty of power for all my virtual machines\n -1x Proxmox server for some Flux nodes\n -1x Truenas box as a 3rd backup target with 28TB of storage + 4 IBM SAS SSDs over iSCSI for my VMs\n -1x unused server\n -1x little APC UPS\n About 700W of power usage. Yes I like to have several iSCSI targets for virtual machines so I can move them around whenever the underlying server needs to get updated. That Mikrotik switch has been a great 10Gb switch for the price.\n I run a whole bunch of services on there, from basic storage, to active directory, exchange, the usual sonarr, radarr, prowlarr stack, paperless, netboot.xyz, some homebrew websites like a lego set inventory and investment tracker, openhab, docker, plex, gameyfin etc....\n It's located where our old heating fuel tank used to be. I pretty happy with the state of my lab for the moment tho I really need to take time (I don't have) to do some real nice cable management.\n The next major project is going to be to redo the room itself with a raised floor, drywall on all wall and ceiling etc. cause it's really just barebone and ugleh!\n https://preview.redd.it/9a89x9tlc41a1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba76a6ecede211887baae0201b2177f19176e49\n    submitted by    /u/h311m4n000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have a 4 TB and an new 8 TB ironwolf drive, which as far as i understand can't put them in a raid (i mean i can do raid 0 which would give me 4TB usable). \n Is it a better idea to return the 8 TB drive and buy 3 4TB to run TrueNAS with 4x4TB drives?\n I have an mATX MB which has 4 sata slots 2x 6Gb/s and 2x 3Gb/s, should i buy a an hba sas and buy one of those sas to 4 sata splitters? Since i will be needing at least 1 more slot for the boot ssd. And do you have any recommendation for the hba?\n Should i even go with TrueNAS or should i go with Unraid (i read that they have a sw raid where you can have different size disks in it)\n I'm fairly new to this so any help is much appriciated :D.\n    submitted by    /u/Janchy_Honor  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is the one that typically handles it so I am a little in the dark about things.\n I have a very vague idea of what would be needed for a home server, but I could be way off the mark. \n With Christmas coming up I wanted to get her something to mess with when it comes to having her own home server for just our friend group. We spoke lightly on the subject of just getting a home server. The interest is there, the knowledge is lacking, so having kind of a cheap starter setup seems like a decent enough way to go. \n As for games, we would most likely have mod Minecraft, V Rising, Farming simulator, terraria, ect.\n We would typically have less than 10 people at any time, and the interests of the group swaps almost monthly in a rotation of games. So probably wouldn't need to be running multiple servers at once, but just have the ability to switch between them. \n Thanks in advance for helping a well intentioned oblivious husband.\n    submitted by    /u/Kitrollo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.\n I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.\n What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.\n MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/\n Many thanks in advance.\n TL;DR Exchange Server for Absolute Bargain Bin Level Idiots Guides Plz\n    submitted by    /u/SirWobbyTheFirst  \n [link]   [comments]",

What I came up with was taking 2 DirecTV DECA adapters, I took an antronix power inserter and used it to deinsert power so I could split it to the two DECA devices, but I found out that there are no existing splitters on the market that power pass on more than one point simultaneously so I had to make my own DC splitter by taking an old crappy splitter prying the glued back off and cutting out the magnet wire and ferrites and soldered a piece of copper wire between all the ports. Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible. I only really ever used the device for testing, I never got around to installing it as I intended and then I went back to Comcast and the coax was no longer dead so it sat in a box until I found it today.\n https://preview.redd.it/by3i8md3zs0a1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=080a7005c5809341fb7828f27cbed12c6ec47815\n    submitted by    /u/blufeb95  \n [link]   [comments]",

After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.\n Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!\n  \nThe server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?\n The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?\n The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/_xulion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'll be using clustering for the first time and I think I know the answer to this but I wanted to be sure.\n My cluster for the time being is going to be a bunch of old laptops - I have a dl380p but it's physically elsewhere for a while. I have 2gbe through Google Fiber and the switches to support the throughput, but if I cluster these old laptops together and one of them doesn't have a NIC capable of that speed, then the whole cluster is going to suffer from a bottleneck across all resources right? \n I guess I don't understand how to determine the bandwidth necessary for resource access in a cluster and if there is a determinable max throughput or if it's just \"the more the better.\" \n My question summarized though is: Will I bottleneck ESXi cluster performance if one of the nodes has a NIC that is significantly slower than the others?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Hollowpoint357  \n [link]   [comments]",

My main computer is a mac mini.\n How is the GPU passthrough with esxi 7.x and windows ? is it always a gamble for each hardware / software update ?\n Can I find a small SFF that I can add a modern graphic card ? or a 'tower' model with a modern graphic card that work ?

Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.\n The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)\n Sorry, lights out\n    submitted by    /u/Knurpel  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct?

I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.\n Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense\n Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.\n Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Khormid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Rack mounted stuff just doesn't work in my place.\n But the hardware mounted inside:\n Supermicro X10SLL-F mobo\n Xeon E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz\n 32GiB ECC RAM\n 2 port Intel Ethernet card with a model number of AOC-SGP-i2 on it\n 2x 2TB Mech SATA HDDs. I think. I didn't pull those out, they didn't have it explicitly written on them, and I am taking a guess from the model number which has a 2000 in the front.\n It boots. I got to a VMWare screen but didn't have any of the passwords. Wonder if they will give them to me. But then I got high, watched the Bolts, and played video games. I will mess with it more during the weekend.\n Added pictures. I thought I added those.\n    submitted by    /u/DarkRookie1  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.\n Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)\n This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.\n For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.\n After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?\n And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.\n    submitted by    /u/xRoguestatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)\n I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:\n 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)\n 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives\n I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process\n Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently?

I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).\n I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?\n So there are two possibilities:\n  \nmy 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;\n I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^\n  \nI hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either.

My current rack is in my basement and this is just going to go in the same place but the weight is going to be substantially more than what's in the current rack. \n New rack: https://greatcabinets.com/product/wm/ (39\"/19U model with the plexi door)\n New UPS: https://www.apc.com/us/en/product/SMT1500RM2UC/apc-smartups-line-interactive-1500va-rackmount-2u-120v-6x-nema-515r-outlets-smartconnect-port+smartslot-avr-lcd/\n Existing: Cisco Catalyst 2960X, HP Elitedesk 800 G4, HP Prodesk G4 400, 24 port patch panels x2, Xfinity modem, two 1U PDU's and some other random IoT stuff. Probably another 50lbs max so I'm guessing we're talking 150 lbs. weight max.\n The existing rack is a 12U open frame rack mounted to a brick wall in my house. The new rack is going in the same place but I want to make sure I mount it properly.\n So that's the question...what hardware should I use to mount this new rack so that all my gear doesn't spontaneously and violently meet my floor when I'm least expecting it thus ruing thousands of dollars worth of stuff?\n    submitted by    /u/400HPMustang  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did not want to do NTFS but...I would prefer it to HFS+ at this point. \n If yes to ext4 and/or NTFS: If I format one drive at a time, would that work?

          "description": "Hello all.\n ​\n I have a NAS in a SilverStone DS380 (8-hotswap bay) along with some external USB 3.0 disk enclosures, making a total of 12x10TB but the pool is starting to get full and I am thinking of adding 4x20TB in short-term (Q1 2023) getting to 12x20TB in the mid-term (Q4 2024).\n ​\n SilverStone DS380 8-bay\n I do not have space for jumping to a rack solution (which is always on my mind and I will do for sure once i move home) so I need to stick in the meantime with tower-based NAS/DAS solutions. The ideal case would be the 12-bay Synology model of the pic, with the possibility to daisy-chain another 12-bay model to it, but I cannot ID it or find a non-rack alternative.\n ​\n ​\n Synology DS 12-bay\n ​\n Basically, I am trying to find a tower-size 8-bay (minimum) to 12-bay (preferable) DAS (no need to be hot-swap) with USB connection to attach it to my DS380 NAS until I move to a real rack solution (early 2025). \n ​\n I have found some solutions from Orico, Mediasonic, Fantec, OWC, Sabrent... but I read a lot of connectionand cooling issues from this solutions I need to avoid as my system is on 24/7 as a backup and media server to 4 users. Plus I find them too overpriced for just a steel case with trayless bays ($50?), 150w low-efficiency PSU ($30?) and a bunch of SATA to USB adapters ($15?).\n ​\n ​\n Mediasonic 8-bay\n ​\n The best option I manage is another DS380 as a JBOD DAS, with a 300W gold SFX PSU, a pair of SSF-8088 connectors and SFF-8087 cables, but I would need to adress the dual-PSU synchronism with a Supermicro JBOD power control board for example and I would need to buy a JBOD card on my main system with external SSF-8088 connectors.\n ​\n Any thoughts on this? I live in Europe so the available solutions may be reduced.\n ​\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/jfromeo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Let me spin you a tale as old as time about a man and his data. Hopefully, you can learn that without a solid main setup, even backups cannot save you. \n The story starts in 2016 when I bought my first RAID controller and drives to build my first storage server. Being of young age and with limited means, I opted to cheap out on the controller and buy the (as I later figured out) awful HighPoint Rocketraid 840A, then going for about $300. Compared with an LSI card with 16 ports, that was approximately a third of the price when buying new (Stupid me didn't even consider buying used). Of course, it later turns out that the hardware RAID6 capabilities I bought the card for are not even present, but that is another story for another day. \n So I set up a volume in the card's BIOS, and install so…",

          "description": "Hello all,\n on recommandation of : u/halbzu\n I will post my question here.\n Hello niece and nephews, its testlab01 with a new question and advise needed.\n I want to buy as in the TS says an NAS. a 4bay nas to have it in RAID-5 for fail over. The reason for this is because we are running out of cloud storage on my device as my families devices. Google etc, and when i want to expand the cloud storage i need to pay a lot for something what is not mines. And if i dont pay anymore i still need to store all the files to something local. So in this case an NAS would be the best solution.\n So i know only two brands Synology the number(1) famous NAS brand, and QNAP what is more for professionals i think. My preference self goes to Synology because the software DSM.\n But i am still not really convinced which one to buy. In my shopping cart (eBay) i have added DS920+ and 4x 2tb IronWolf ST4000VN006 in total i will have 12TB of storage with fail over of 1 disk of 4tb.\n In the meantime 923+ came out in November 2022 and is a upgrade compared to the ds920+Pro\"s- 2.5gbps Ethernet port.- upgrade to 16gb ram, not official only upgrade to 8gb with an extra so-dimm 4GB.- new CPU AMD this time (but no GPU processing power, so PLEX will not be the great solution)- now you can have nvme storage pools.\n I am not a big watcher because of work (not that much time) but it would be always good when i have time to watch something without problems.\n My budget is about 800€ less is always better, i have a voucher of 300€ discount so from 966€ will be like 699€ what a good price is for NAS + storage 16GB.\n still to take the 923+ that one is more expensive as well. But getting longer updates as well, or to stay with the 920+ + or even a QNAP to take?\n building a NAS etc, will not be the choice because it will never give you all the bells an whisels what you get with an NAS.\n    submitted by    /u/testlab01  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd ideally like it to save thumbnails and descriptions as well.\n Second Goal: Some sort of easy interface for browsing, searching, and watching those archived videos, so I'm not just using crummy Windows search to try and find a video in the future.\n Does anyone have suggestions that can address 1 or 2, or both?\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/turn-down-for-what  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to expand because I'm quickly approaching 7TB. I have my previous desktop computer that has about 8 drive bays that I would like to expand over time. I would like to get some opinions from the experts before I begin throwing time and money at this project.\n What OS/software should I use to manage/initialize my NAS? -- so far I have heard of TrueNAS, FreeNAS, ZFS and Unraid. Note:not even sure if I know what i am talking about here or if there are differences i am not aware of.\n Is expanding my \"pools\" for future additional drives going to be an issue? I don't want to be moving around several TB.\n I also read that my drives would have to be matching in size or I won't be able to use the drive to their fullest extent. I was thinking about going to 12-14 TB drives right away but maybe I should by smaller capacity drives to start out? It just seems that in the future my lower capacity drives with hold me back.\n Thoughts about backups - just looking for some suggestions? I read about snapshots but I'm not sure that applies here. I am familiar with the 3-2-1 rule but with the TB amounts of data I have I can't reasonably buy duplicates of all drives just to have 1 to 1 backups (if that makes sense) but maybe there is no way around this.\n I started off my journey with my synology NAS just to see if it would work and now that I have become a little more serious about my data-hoarding I would like a better setup with more storage as well as implement best practices. I see this as the next logical step before I get something that is rack mounted. Let me know all of your thoughts as I am sure I have missed something or have not thought a position through.

          "description": "Hello everyone,\n As I frequently see interesting threads on Reddit, and I want to get them offline to 1) find them again easily, and 2) preserve them in case messages get removed, I made myself some time ago a Python script to \"download\" threads off Reddit.This script does not only download the thread, but generates a nice HTML file, so it can be opened in a browser and the thread navigated around conveniently. Here is an example of such HTML file.\n Recently, I told myself it would be better to have a web frontend for that tooling, since I am sometimes on the go and do not have the script and/or the Python interpreter on my machine.\n This therefore led to RedditArchive, a Flask self-hosted app to archive and download Reddit threads (screenshots available in the README):https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver\n You can install it on a small server of yours, such as a Raspberry Pi or a VPS. Installations instructions are provided if you want to try it on.\n If you do not want to deal with the hassle of setting a web server up, worry not! I also made the original script available here:https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver-standalone\n Do not hesitate to comment and make suggestions – I have ideas for further features, but that's probably for another time. 🦉\n    submitted by    /u/Ailothaen  \n [link]   [comments]",

I ordered another 16TB SAS drive and a SAS RAID controller a couple weeks ago to put the new computer together. I want to make a basic RAID 1.\n Windows shows the controller as \"Avago adapter sas3 3008 fury - StorPort\" and says the driver is good, but I don't see any sign of the connected drives, or any UI to set up the controller.\n Are there any good guides for this?

Im currently sat at over 1m images, from deviantart, pixiv, pinterest but then i discovered wallhaven.....you can see where this is going.\n Assuming you are using gallery-dl with the '--write-metadata' option to download an ID search or batch of single images it will check the json for the file for the username, create a folder structure and then sort the files for that user to the correct folder.\n it'll then add the user account to a txt file for batch downloading of that users uploads. Eventually, ill no doubt have all the user accounts (if they have uploaded) but i then use this for more downloads.\n As an example, i download all the images tagged for cyberpunk 2077 lets say around 300, this is parsed i then have 90 users ready to go and end up with 100k images after running that list. They state they only have about 1m images themselves so shouldn't take long to get it all then just append to my collection.\n I couldn't find a list of all users, a search all(*) or a list of how many IDs they have. But if you know, let me know. I could have just iterated over IDs in a loop 1 to 999999 but thats possibly a lot of waste.\n Anyway......\n As i say, this fits my need for how i scrape stuff from there but thought id share it should someone want to improve/make use of it.

I am unsure what would be the best next steps for backing up my files. \n My initial strategy was to start backing up on one HDD 1 and then set up HDD 2 as a mirrored backup. Now that I have it all plugged in, I am unsure about the best way to do that and looking for advice. I am working from a 4TB Macbook Pro that will go back and forth to work with me and ideally, the TM will be a part of a desk/monitor set up I can just connect laptop to when working from home. \n Something like drivepool seems perfect for what I need but I can see from other posts that's not an option for Mac. Should I just set up a ChronoSync task to mirror HDD 1 to HDD 2 and sync whenever I add files?\n I'm a noob at all this so any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/DaBeigeMage  \n [link]   [comments]",

Tried going through and making sure APM was disabled, spindown was disabled, etc, but after exhausting all resources I am fairly sure this is a function of the enclosure(even though it is not listed in the product info anywhere I can find). this causes extremely slow load times for Plex initially and can cause temporary hangups browsing files, etc. Anyone know of a good 3.5\" enclosure that does not have a sleep function?

          "description": "Hello r/DataHoarder, first time long time.\n I have two hard drives I need some quick help with.\n Drive #1\n First is a Western Digital (I know) Red 3TB drive in my PR4100 NAS (I know, I know). Right now the software flags it but does not tell me why. When I check the SMART data via the NAS software, it seems to give me the same info for all 4 drives. (Clicking SMART on 2,3,4 all give the same numbers) This drive is under warranty, so I plan to buy a Seagate and use the RMA WD as a cold backup. But any info on how to get a SMART dump from that individual drive, or figure exactly why it's showing as bad, would be appreciated. This is my second WD drive to die within a year of purchase.\n Drive #2\n Second is a 4TB Western Digital (I know, I know, I know) Blue sitting inside my desktop. This one is giving me an Uncorrectable Sector Count. CrystalDisk just flags it as caution, but I'm not very familiar on the risk here. Also WD's software gives it a cleanbill of health. Should I just replace it, or is it fine for the time being? There is nothing really critical on that drive, so it's not a big problem if it just bites the dust out of the blue. But I would rather avoid it if possible.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Jim777PS3  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have manually copied all of the data over (about 48tb) manually, but keeping them the same is going to be an impossible task to keep up on manually.\n I'm looking for suggestions on what software would best fit my needs for keeping the data backed up/identical. I have enough horsepower that I can create VM's if needed.\n Not sure I'll be able to hit all of these targets, but here is what I'm hoping for: - Scan server 1 and server 2. Copy any missing files from server 1 to server 2. - Ease of use / intuitive. I'm not much the command line guy, but can be taught. Something that is relatively easy to use would be a bonus. - Incremental vs. Differential - which would best fit my needs? - Anything I'm missing?

I removed the 3.3v pins (third from the left, etc, done this before on other models) on both, but one of the drives still doesn't want to come alive when plugged in unless I'm using the USB board supplied with the drive enclosure. The drive works, just only when using the enclosure's board.\n The machine I would like to use this drive on is a NAS enclosure with a SATA backplane, so I can't use a molex adapter to get around the usual 3.3v issue. If I'm not able to get anywhere otherwise, I plan to try swapping the drives between machines, but would like to avoid this if possible as it would require (another) array parity rebuild.\n Both drives report as WD160EDGZ-11B2DA0.

          "description": "So I have two of the US dub of the 1980s Mr. Men and Little Miss VHS tapes I have since getting into the series back in 2008 and a Anpanman tape that has 3 episodes that aren't on DVD. My brother knows how to record the tapes and digitize them. But there's a few problems. One is that our VCR is a Magnavox VCR/DVD combo GDV228MG9 , and that the tapes can sometimes jump. And if that happens, it messed up the recording.\n My brother researched that we should invest on another VCR player that is S-VHS. But he also told me that we should also look into a VCR with a time base corrector. The major roadblock is that they are too much to buy. And while trying to not spend the money on foolish things is a step, it'll still take a long to achieve that. Not only that, I don't know how long the tapes will last, especially since the Mr. Men ones are in their mid 30s. And I can't just simply buy another copy of the tapes as they aren't on ebay anymore. And I don't know anybody that has the best equipment that can actually digitized the tapes. I did had one friend years ago who helped me with a recorded Thomas tape, but I don't know if he still does it.\n ​\n The Anpanman tape I bought months ago\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/mrnormal94  \n [link]   [comments]",

We had a scare once when I wouldn't mount properly on boot, causing him to think he lost the last 27 years of photos and random internet forum backups that he has stored on me, but one reboot later, he found me again. It gave him a little bit of a scare, so he found another one of me (THE AUDACITY to think he could find another ME) and stuck us together into RAID0. \n Lemme tell you what, this man was ESTATIC to find out that he had double the storage, while still having the protection of RAID. He went on an unhinged downloading spree, grabbing everything he could find online he thought was rare and people might want one day. Random things like old MTV shows, a live action Spirited Away play (ITS ALREADY A MOVIE, WHO NEEDS A PLAY?), and technical manuals for old hardware (?????????).\n Anyways, it was a lot. The heat and pressure to deliver finally was enough for me, and I said 'Peace, Im out'. \n Well, turns out he didn't like that, and started breaking things. I tried to get away, but he grabbed me before I could and said he was going to take me to a 'specialist' to get 'fixed'. Like, I don't need fixing – Ive made my choice. He kept claiming I was so valuable and he needed me, but then decided to treat me like that? Without any backups??? Clearly I wasn't that important to him. Regardless of my decisions, he hauled me down to a data specialist to recover some stuff, but they couldn't do anything. \n So reddit, AITA for dying to teach him about backups and that RAID0 is not a backup?\n    submitted by    /u/XxNerdAtHeartxX  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously youtube tries to stop this sort of stuff so I've used a couple different versions of this method over the years with moderate success. The other thing I've tried is chrome extensions which again, may work for a period of time but ultimately get blocked. Many of the times, the higher quality versions I've never been able to download. It seems like the VLC method maxed out at 720p/1080p. I'd really like to be able to save content from youtube and others in the max quality possible.\n I think the best way from here is to examine the code which has worked for me in the past (5-10+ years) when code was a little more straightforward, but finding the actual content is \"wrapped\" (sorry I don't code) in java(?). I'd like to learn enough to squirrel this stuff out myself, any suggestions - or does a website's media player query things to an outside source to pull content? \n Right now, I'd like to rip this content and three extensions fail to even find the audio or video.

          "description": "About a decade I was worried about my not backed up pictures which were on an external drive, so I went to back them up and the drive failed. Or so I thought. Repeated attempts to get the drive to spin up just resulted in a clicking head and nothing. So I put it in a drawer to eventually take to a data recovery service when I could afford it. \n Time passes, and yesterday I was doing some file management of newer pictures which needed to happen (In addition to backing them up) when I got a wild hair to plug the drive in to see what would happen. Low and behold, it spins up....sort of. Same head skipping/stalling issue. The difference this time is I can see the files and am able to copy some, for a few seconds till it freezes. \n Windows file transfer sucks for this so I try TeraCopy, pausing the transfer when it freezes, unplugging the drive, plugging it back in and starting the transfer over. This works...sort of. For whatever reason it only recognized about a third of the files this way. \n So I try again, and this time it works flawlessly without any head issues throughout the entire transfer. I saved about 130GB worth of pictures from a fairly formative time in my life sort of by accident. Now I'm sorting them properly and backing up multiple copies.\n    submitted by    /u/TwoHeadedPanthr  \n [link]   [comments]",

For my third copy, after researching cloud providers (cost, speed, and reliability), I've come to the conclusion that it's best to set up another NAS/server that I will plug in at a friend's place.\n I have two things I would like feedback on:\n  \nEncryption: what do you recommend to encrypt my data off-site? Assuming the server is always connected to the internet when on, is there a way to make it so that when the computer starts up, the encrypted data is not accessible, where I get an email or notification to do somehow remotely unlock the data? What I'm trying to guard against is someone taking the server and accessing my private data. Assuming it gets stolen, I'd like to know that the data is encrypted and not accessible.\n \nSyncing: given this data size (12TB now, 20TB in 5 years), is it best to keep the data in sync using Syncthing? Or would the size cause issues for Syncthing? If so, I would just have a daily Cron job to rsync the data.\n \n Welcome any insights you all are willing to share. Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/vinhdizzo  \n [link]   [comments]",

In seeking to do routine backups, and remove this data from my main machine eventually, I installed the sync service on another machine, and set it out to 'sync'. \n The new machine now reports the sync is complete, however when I do a rightclick to check properties, the report between the two machines does not match. The file count and storage count differ, by several gigs and thousands of files.\n I can see a couple of possibilities: \n  \nThe two machines count files/space differently, since they are different OS, which seems weird but possible. The reporting does not reflect reality.

I’m fairly new to DAS.\n I was wondering if anyone else has experience similar issues with their Terramaster D5-300 DAS and shucked WD 20TB WD2000EDGZ drives.\n I’m not using this in RAID, just default single disk mode. \n I recently bought both and have began the install process and powering it on. I’ve noticed the 2x 20TB causes the lights to turn solid orange and repeated beeping. (All drives have been formatted already for Mac OS Extended Journaled ahead of installation.) This happens in any slot I put either 20TB drives in and both when they’re both in. I’ve pulled the drives out and connected the 20TB drives using a USB to SATA cable and they are recognized and works fine.\n However, my 2x 14TB WD140EDGZ drives and 1x 10TB WD100EMAZ can be placed in any slot and are recognized and works as intended. When all 5 drives are in, only the 20TBs exhibit the orange light and beeping from the DAS.\n There isn’t much documentation about this online or on their forums and thought to ask the community if they had similar experiences as I wait for a response from their support.

          "description": "Hello all! I’m a professional photographer who makes 8-12TB a year of data. My previous system catastrophically failed on me last month, so I’m back to the drawing boards. \n I’ve already ordered most of what I think I need, but looking for validation that this is a decent idea before I set it all up, fire up the single copy of my current archive data that still exists and start to copy that over to the new system. \n Primary location/archives: Synology 920+, 4x14TB drives, RAID5\n Studio location (offsite): Synology 720+, 2x14TB, RAID1\n Cloud: Google Drive Enterprise\n My plan is to split the main array into 3 folders @ ~14TB/ea. I plan to mirror these folders to the array offsite as a backup to my primary archives. When the offsite backup array gets full, the drives in it will be pulled, put into secure storage, replaced, then mirrored with the next folder. Hopefully that system makes sense? This would hopefully result in me only needing to fuss with this backup array once every 18months or so. \n My plan had initially been to use RAID5 for the on-site system, but upon further research, it seems like people really don’t like this setup? I was hoping to have several years of my most recent archives available locally so I can pull images for proposals, website, etc, and RAID5 would give me 42TB with this set-up. ~in theory~, since I’d have a physical backup of this data, I’d be able to arduously restore the data in the case of a dramatic failure/rebuild failure?\n I’m wondering now if I’d be better off doing RAID10 for my primary archives. I think 28TB would give sufficient access to files id need to access occasionally, and it seems people find this to be a more reliable and trustworthy set-up? \n Both RAID arrays would be for archiving only, and data would very rarely be altered once it was stored. \n Money spent on drives is also not really an issue. Just want reliable, and secure. \n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/charliesfinger  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I currently have a pretty jank data hoarding setup built in an old tower with 4x4TB HDDs in a software RAID0 that is then combined with 2x16TB drives in a software RAID5, plus two JBOD SSDs for the OS and cache. Currently it's being managed with mdadm via the Cockpit project on CentOS 8 Stream. This has worked fine, but the machine that is handling my storage is also handling all of my other processing; Plex server, various VMs, game servers, etc.\n I've just purchased a new rack and plan to rackmount this machine in a Rosewill RSV-L4500U and grab a few used Dell Poweredge servers to use as ESXi hosts. In the process, I plan to add a few more drives to the array and I'd like to switch to an operating system that's more dedicated to managing storage. I've looked into TrueNAS and Unraid, but both seem to have a pretty major drawback that makes them less than ideal for me; TrueNAS appears to be exceptionally difficult to add drives to after the fact, which means I'd need to buy vastly more HDDs all at once, and Unraid suffers from poor read performance due to its single-spool nature, which isn't ideal for loading VMs off of. I still need to have this machine run the Plex server, as it'll be the only chassis that can fit the GPU for hardware transcoding. \n I might just be misunderstanding the use-cases and features of these operating systems, and if so, please do inform me! What I'm really looking for is a storage-focused OS that makes it simple to manage and monitor traditional RAID, but I'm finding that surprisingly difficult to find! \n Wondering if any of you have experience with any solutions that might fit my needs.\n    submitted by    /u/asphere8  \n [link]   [comments]",

An example podcast is here: http://legaldesignpodcast.com/episode-51-joining-the-boring-revolution-with-indy-johar/. Using videodownloader on Firefox, I can generate a .js file which about about 8mb. I'm assuming that's a javascript file that gets downloaded.

The answer isn't to simply change the extension to .mp3 in this case. \n Another option is to source the podcast from Spotify, but all of the options I've seen are paid downloader apps with so-so reviews.

          "description": "I've read what feels like countless discussions on scanners and scanning processes to the point where it makes me slightly nauseous. I'm new to it. I'm buying a scanner in January and finally embarking on my long awaited scanning journey. I intend to digitze my collection of fashion magazines - and the most important aspect of them are the images, of course. It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. \n However, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don't know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don't want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there's a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture. I'm providing some images of my tear sheets. All help is greatly appreciated! \n Detail\n Double spread\n    submitted by    /u/cambynes  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I have some flash drives I’ve gained over the years some new some old, a brand new 2tb and a hand me down 1tb drive and a photo scanner and I want to do it right so I have a few questions. \n First: Storage. I found a leather zip up case on Amazon to put all the drives in. Are these recommended for storage or is there any way to go wrong with just flash drives and small hard drives? As far as another location goes, my family will all have copies of the photos when I am done and even as I start to save them I’ll keep some drives at my brother’s house. But do you guys recommend cloud saving, and if so what service? \n Second: File saving. I don’t know much about computer files and compression or anything like that. I also have some files coming from Mac devices and don’t know if it will be important for all files to be the same file type when all is said and done? Is this preferred, should i convert all my file types to a certain type like png or jpg or both?

I feel like I'm going over kill because the average person would only have 1 small cheap backup drive.\n \nShould I backup literally everything (including OS), some things (User files like documents, pictures, etc.) or only important things (ex: my insurance papers)\n \nHow do you manage version control? Let's say I make a monthly backup and one day I modify a file on my computer. But it wont automatically update on the backups too. Is there a way to do this efficiently without having to worry about having the wrong version of my file?\n \n I'm using FreeFileSync to mirror my data, because it would take too long to do a backup from scratch everytime.

          "description": "Hi All, this is yet another cloud backup question. I've researched a whole bunch, but some of the posts are old so I wanted to know what the current status of the service is from the usual providers.\n How is Backblaze with upload/download speeds for their Personal backup plan? Is the restore process still limited by how you can restore the files, and how fast you can download them?\n Is the Backblase B2 better than the personal plan? Are there fewer restrictions/limits compared to the Personal plan? Does it allow you keep the files on the cloud even if you unplug the hard drive for many days? I think the Personal has a 30 day limit. How easy is the restore process? Does it allow you to select all files and do a backup?\n As for Crashplan, does it also have limitations for upload/download speed and how you can restore the backup? What about iDrive, icedrive, GDrive, DropBox, etc? I know I'm asking a lot but there is not much information on people's experiences with restoring the backups.\n I have about a minimum of 4TB of data I want to backup. In total I have close to 100TB of personal files, ripped CDs, and movies. I was thinking Blackblaze B2, but you have to rely on 3rd apps to use it, which is fine with me. My data is currently on a 8x14TB ZFS NAS machine running Ubuntu. I would like to be able to upload/download as fast as I can. I'm on a symmetric 500mbps fiber line. My main priority is to keep my 4TB of priceless data safe, and be able to restore quickly and not have the cloud provider delete it after the drive being offline for at least 30 days, but 60 days would be better.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Aviyan  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was copying files from one drive to the Seagate drive in question (so I don't care about getting the data from that - I just want it working so then I can copy to it again). My computer completely froze (I was doing another copy with 2 other drives at the same time - those ones are fine though, funnily enough) and had no choice but to restart it during the copy.\n The main source drive was fine (thank goodness!) but the Segate 5TB not so much. I don't think it's a mechanical failure (in the platter / read/write head sense) - it spins fine, no beeping or any unusual sounds. But when I plug it in, it disconnects after a few seconds. When opening disk management on windows, it shows \"Unknown Not initialized\" for a split second. Given the circumstances of the failure, faulty cables wouldn't be a thing - although I tried different ones anyway to be doubly sure. So clearly some hardware issue, but I doubt mechanical - so I opened up the ensure (without snapping the clips somehow, lol).\n I put the hard drive inside a spare enclosure. Plugged it in - it didn't disconnect, but it wasn't showing up normally. I go on disk management, and I can see again \"Unknown Not initialized\". Again, I don't care about getting data from this, so I right-clicked on \"initialize\". It says \"The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error.\" So definitely software will not work whatsoever. This leads me to believe I fried the control board / PCB, which provides an interface for the mechanical drive to communicate with the computer. Thus, I can't access the drive.\n The model of the PCB is 100721570 REV E.\n Am I correct in surmising that this is a PCB failure, and that I simply need to buy a replacement (AliExpress seems to be the only place I can buy this)? And apparently I need to copy the BIOS firmware from my original PCB to the replacement - is that true?\n Or is it really a mechanical failure?\n    submitted by    /u/craxing  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I finally installed the new Google Drive app. It's definitely an improvement over the old Backup and Sync, however there's one thing I am unclear on, and I can't find the answer anywhere.\n You have the option to mirror certain folders from your computer. All Google says is that it will keep files and folders the same in both places. What I interpret this to mean is, while syncing is happening, it will keep track of where changes are made and then make the same changes in the other place. If you add a file on your computer, it adds it to the cloud. If you delete a file in the cloud, it deletes it from your computer. It knows where the change is made, and makes the same change in the other place.\n But what if I turn off syncing for 2 months, then I delete 2 files from my computer's folder, then 3 months later I turn on syncing again. How is Google Drive going to know whether files have been deleted from my local storage or added to Drive? Is it going to add the files back to my local storage or is it going to delete them from Drive? What will it use as reference?\n In the old Backup and Sync, there were options where you could tell it what to do in these scenarios. I messed up once and after moving a whole bunch of files from a mirrored folder while it wasn't being synced, I then resubscribed to Drive and it re-added all of those files, and now that folder is a complete mess, 2 years later I still haven't fixed it. I wanna make sure this doesn't happen again, but in the new app there are no settings to set a behavior for when it discovers changes that were made while syncing was off.\n Thanks, any input is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Qbccd  \n [link]   [comments]",

Benchmarks and file transfers show performance to be as advertised but I’m having an issue interacting with it in Explorer. I have SABnzbd set to transfer the ISOs after processing and I see the write rate to be > 200 MB/s along with other file transfer actions.\n Whenever I try to right-click and view properties on any folder and file on the drive, it takes > 5 or so seconds before the right-click menu comes up and another > 30 or so seconds before the info window comes up. Browsing is also a touch slower compared to my older and far smaller external drives.\n I tried leaving it as the only connected device, disabling shell menu extensions, Windows Search, services, and startup items and nothing has worked. The only time that the drive and Explorer don’t exhibit this issue is when I boot into Safe Mode. The drive functions as expected with right-clicking and retrieving folder and file properties as instantaneous.\n Other Explorer alternatives like Files doesn’t exhibit the same issue either so it definitely seems like a Windows issue.\n Anyone else has seen this behavior and might have an insight into this?\n    submitted by    /u/Sigvard  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have around 5TB worth of data that I want to consolidate into one place and want to know how would I go around and do such a thing.\n Short backstory, I had a system with 2 drives, a 500GB SSD and 2TB HDD. Bought a 1TB HDD during start of the pandemic for recording location of recorded meetings. Year 1 into Pandemic, 2TB HDD has an error and on a \"Caution\" status from CrystalDiskInfo. I was also planning to build a new rig that year so I bought one 1TB NVME SSD(not part of the situation), a 2TB Ironwolf HDD and 4TB Barracuda.\n I didn't want to use my new drives on the PC so I used two 1TB External HDDs to store the data. Then a year later the 1TB I bought at the start of the pandemic was in \"Bad\" condition, so I gave in and plugged my 4TB HDD and transferred my files. For some reason I also plugged in the 2TB HDD. Now all of them are in use. \n So I did a disk analyze using WizTree and found out that I have half of my total storage full, not to mention earlier in the day I got an error that there was not enough space in my boot drive when I was saving stuff into there. \n Now how would I go around completely copying over these files into a whole separate drive/drives, eliminating duplicates and make sure everything is copied properly, so that I can completely wipe my current system and basically start from scratch.\n I would also like to ask on what kind of storage I should use to store this on. I think it will be just a cold storage, with the occasional rummage through, but it might also be another dump place I can continue adding to. I don't want to delete any of the files, more of its a hassle rather than sentimental stuff, but there are stuff that I definitely want to keep there. I would also say that I don't have much money to put towards storing these. So I guess a solution where I can add on over time would be best.\n    submitted by    /u/InfraDelta  \n [link]   [comments]",

After Black Friday it is now back up to $119.99:\n https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Blue-Hard-Drive/dp/B09KMGQG5Y\n All other slots are populated with a mix of helium and non-helium 8TB drives, all MyBook and EasyStore shucks. I could not find any information on the Internet regarding whether this drive would honor the disable head parking command. It does.\n The warranty was advertised as 2 years. WD warranty checker lists the warranty as 3 years.\n This WD80EAZZ arrived with idle3-tools reporting head parking at 80 (8 seconds). This drive honors the idle3-tools command to disable head parking. I ran idle3-tools via direct sata connection from an Ubuntu 20.04 server.\n To do this from Ubuntu:\n sudo apt update\n sudo apt install idle3-tools\n sudo fdisk -l (to list what disk label your WD80EAZZ is set at)\n sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n (verify that drive respond to the idle3 command, and lists the parking time as 80)\n sudo idle3ctl -d /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n (you should get a \"head parking disabled\" message)\n Shutoff the computer. Fully poweroff the drive. Reboot and run\n sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n ...to verify that the head parking disabled setting survived poweroff.\n This drive appears to be mechanically identical to the white label non-helium EasyStore/MyBook drives. But, it does arrive with head parking set to 80.\n This drive seems like a steal at this price. I had 2 4TB Reds fail within the warranty period. Due to the failed Reds, I gave up on Reds and started buying white label 8TB drives. I have had zero white label drives fail so far.

Is it a bad idea to consider having data off-site without anyone to maintain it? Does more drives=more maintenance? \n Qu2: i.e I could 3 larger drives in Z1 or 6smaller drives in Z2, does one option (typically) require more involvement in replacing faulty drives on average? \n I would of course be able to access the drive via ssh/web interface to maintain the nas remotely.\n Qu3: Finally, in the case that one drive has bad sectors in truenas - is there an easy way to work out which drive has the fault?

I’ve been doing a multi-year project where I’m gathering all of my family photos, old and new. I follow the 3-2-1 backup plan to make sure nothing happens in the task of gathering and digitizing old photos, but now I have thousands of pieces of media that I need to comprehensively organize that will make them easy to find and view. I’ve looked online but a lot of the programs don’t seem to be what I specifically need, lacking some feature. \n The key features I want out of the organizing software: \n  \nTagging system (e.g. being able to search for a photo/group of photos by date/person/event/place/source at the same time) \n \nA timeline view (not really needed but would definitely be awesome.)\n \nAbility to mass rename media in an organized way (eg. making a group of photos ‘2021_03_08-baseball-game-pics-cannon_rebel’ \n \nLossless conversion (might just need another program for this one) / lossless viewing after import \n \nSupports ranges of file formats (PNG, JPEG, HEIC, GIF, etc.)\n \n The program doesn’t need cloud options/storage available or built-in photo editing, but if it happens to have it then that’s an added bonus. \n In total when I’m completely done with the project, I’m expecting probably about 200-300gb of media. \n I’m open for both free and paid programs, just let me know a good one, thanks!\n Edit: Currently using Windows 10\n    submitted by    /u/Acharvix  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This topic has been discussed many times, but i didn't find anything specific to my situation.\n I would like to create a RAID1 with 2 sata drives (same brand, model,capacity). My objective is to have this raid accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu, wich are located in 2 other separate drives. So i am not trying to boot from the raid, i am just using it for storing data. I know that the easy solution would be to go for a real raid controller card, but im trying to find out if it is really necessary to spend more money. As for the software raid option, for what i've understood you can't do such a thing and make it accessible from both linux and windows, but correct me if im wrong.\n So now i am thinking about doing it using the built-in motherboard controller, but every discussion i've read comes to the conclusion that you shouldn't do it because:\n 1 - If you change motherboard you won't be sure your next hardware is gonna read the data.\n 2 - motherboard implementations of raid usually use CPU resources.\n 3 - motherboard implementations usually dont have powerloss safety features, and this could mess up the data. \n My questions are:\n 1 - Are statements (1) and (3) true also if you have a RAID1 configuration? I am saying this beacuse since it is just a straight copy i would assume the way the data is written isn't that cryptic and i can read it easily if one of the 2 corrupts(or if i change motherboard).\n 2 - Do all motherboards do this \"fake\" raid? In my case on the manufacturer site explicitly says that it supports RAID 0, 1 and 10.\n 3 - Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to do? \n My motherboard : https://it.msi.com/Motherboard/B450-GAMING-PRO-CARBON-MAX-WIFI/Specification \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Cute_Rub_9074  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, as the title says, the two drives are not the same size; one is 6 TB and the other is 10 TB. What I initially thought to do is to create a two partitions on the 10 TB drive: one is the same size as the 6 TB drive and part of the storage space, and the other partition to be an extra general drive for media, game storage, etc.\n So my question is: is this a sensible setup?

As my data grew and I added larger HDDs to the system it seemed like a very cost efficient emergency plan. The original plan (with 2TB drives) was to back them up using a \"toaster\" drive. I'd keep a copy at work and a copy at the house and BackBlaze was the emergency plan. The \"Toaster\" backup went out the window in 2018 when it began to take hours using \"eSata\" as the drives surpassed 10TB.\n Six months ago it dawn on me (one of those Duh? moments) that I now have 33TB of data on the Backblaze cloud from my six 20TB drives. In the event of a catastrophic failure the only way Backblaze allows restoration is by downloading or a second option of selling you a USB drive that they will fill with your data. You can return up to 5 of these per year for credit.* In short, a complete restoration would take a significant amount of time in 8TB chunks, between mailings.\n I have now purchased a Synology DS1821+, which despite what it says does support Seagate Iron Wolf 20TB drives (I currently have it configured using six with SHR-2 redundancy and 1 hot spare. I'd still like to use a cloud backup but is Glacier any better at a large restoration than BackBlaze was?

Set up a windows share of that drive on my network. That PC is plugged in to my comcast router. The Comcast WiFi sucks though so I have an ASUS mesh network plugged in to that for whole house devices. The windows PC also runs Plex so I can’t put it behind a double nat by plugging it into the ASUS. I’ve got a 5ghz backhaul between the mesh network nodes and my home computer hardwired to one of the mesh nodes.\n Here’s the trouble… copying files between them I get like 30mbps. Using windows copy or Teracopy, doesn’t matter. \n Both computers Speedtest at 500mbps to the internet ( and between the computers using a program to test LAN speed at 600+mbps) so clearly the WiFi backhaul is plenty faster to my home pc. \n Any settings tweaks to speed up windows copies? It feels like those copies aren’t multithreaded… is there a better copy program that will?\n    submitted by    /u/Dopey0121  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm a doctoral student, and while I've been storing copies of my research files (camera trap photos, R code files, some GIS files, etc) on an external drive, I've been thinking about adding a cloud storage service for redundancy. My research files at the moment total just under 100 GB (my system in total takes up under 350 GB, in case a full system backup is what is recommended). I don't expect to access these files often (ideally never) but in case something happens on my machine, or I just do something stupid and delete a file/folder I need, I want to be able to quickly access/retrieve the needed files/folders (so not necessarily retrieving the whole system). It would be nice to encrypt my research files, but I'm not working on anything where I am unduly worried about data theft in any case. I'd say my priorities are: \n  \nReliability \n Cost (of storage primarily, then upload/download)\n Download Speed/accessibility \n Security/Privacy \n Upload speed\n  \nI use a Windows machine from Lenovo if that makes any difference, but could conceivably move to a Macbook down the line. I use File History with my external backup drive.\n I'm posting cus I see so many different recommendations from iDrive to Backblaze to IceDrive to Mega, etc, including in this subreddit, and I figure at this point I'm overthinking it and should seek recs for my specific use case scenario (or maybe for what I want, it doesn't really matter all that much what I choose)\n    submitted by    /u/TigerLeader  \n [link]   [comments]",

Typical usage would be copy/move stuff between the internal SSD drive to any one of the six MyBooks (one operation at a time). The important thing is the presence of individual on/off switches, so the drives would only run on demand (I need each one only 2-3 times a week and don't want them spinning up randomly or at boot/shutdown).\n The only semi-legit device I can find is this hub by StarTech, however, most people in the sub have a pretty bad opinion about that brand and the price seems a bit steep, to be honest. That being said, the last thing I want is for my data to become corrupted because of some alphabet soup brand's bad hardware... (speaking of which, any recommendations for a solid USB-B to Type-C data cable are much appreciated!)\n What I like about StarTech's device is the use of actual switches, and not buttons, which usually don't remember the last state after power-cycling...\n Thanks for reading and have a good one!\n    submitted by    /u/kraddock  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi! I’m working on building my unraid NAS using a few recycled parts from previous builds. I was getting things ready when I noticed several bent pins in the old mobo I had slated for the build. I have a 10700k and an 11600k for the cause. I know neither is ideal in terms of power draw/heat, but I’d prefer not to sell and replace. With all that in mind, are there any ATX boards with 2.5g LAN that make more sense than others in terms of features and price? Currently, I only need 6 sata ports and a single m.2 gen 3. Any guidance is appreciated! Thanks!\n Edit: based on my own research it looks like the Gigabyte B560 Aorus Pro AX board might do the trick.

I'd like to keep this practice. \n In the past, I would first mount the share in Nautilus file manager, then open FFS and it would appear as a destination. Now, even if I have mounted the share in Nautilus, the share does not appear in FFS at all. \n The NAS has the IP address 10.10.10.6 and the share is called \"backup\", so I assume I could enter any of the following and one would work: \n /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=10.10.10.6,share=backup \n or \n //10.10.10.6/backup \n or \n smb://10.10.10.6/backup \n but none of these works. \n Has something changed?\n Is there a way to manually add the share's full path to FFS?\n    submitted by    /u/Idiots-R-Invincible  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've been backing up my PC games from places like Steam, GOG, etc. on 100 GB Blu-ray discs. However, I have a lot of games to back up, and modern games can very easily go over 100 GB per game. I've been throwing around the idea of giving up optical media for my backups, and going with something like a 4TB SSD, especially today on Cyber Monday; putting games onto an SSD would be a lot faster than burning them to a Blu-ray disc, and obviously any SSD that I choose is going to hold more than a single Blu-ray disc, even a triple-layer one. If all I'm using the SSD for is long-term storage, can I expect reliability? I don't even plan on putting it into my PC, I would only plug it in externally whenever I want to add something to it for safekeeping, or if I want to restore/recover something later.\n Or, if I'm looking to save some money, how are mechanical HDDs for the long-term? I assume they're not as good as something with no moving parts.\n Thanks in advance for any insight, I really love the idea of long-term archiving, but I admit that I'm pretty new at this.\n    submitted by    /u/FireCrow1013  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I'm Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)\n I'm based in Europe and I've just setup a small cloud storage service.\n A short story about my initial thoughts on this project:\n I've been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I've noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).\n All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren't many affordable (mind you, $5-$7/TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.\n So I've decided to make a little project to \"fix\" this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?). I've had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.\n I'm basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.\n Requesting Feedback:\n I'm offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(\n You can check it out here.\n I'm already working on the next phase (the first one wasn't anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think it can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)\n Thank you for your time! \n Tom\n PS: I've got approval from the moderators to post this thread.\n PS2: I've made a similar post on Hacker News earlier today, just a small FYI.\n    submitted by    /u/ExtraLayer_eu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Back in February I picked up an OWC Mercury Elite Pro external enclosure for pretty cheap, as it was open-box. It's a dual drive enclosure with USB 3 and eSATA connections, fairly well built with an aluminum body and fan in the back, and - importantly - has a hardware RAID controller so it can run your 2 disks individually, in Span mode, or in RAID 0 or 1.\n Thanks to Black Friday, I nabbed 2 10TB WD Red Plus drives for a good price, and my intent is to stick them in the OWC, run them in RAID 1 for mirroring, and then connecting the enclosure to a Thin Client PC over USB 3, and then installing Debian to the Thin Client to run everything I need - Plex, backups, maybe some minor game server hosting and file serving.\n The OWC's RAID seems fully featured, if one of the mirrored drives dies, all you need to do is insert a new identical drive and it will automatically rebuild (I would obviously still back up the remaining good drive before initiating the rebuild), I'm just wondering if it sounds like a good idea. On one hand, USB 3 is a very fast standard, but on the other, it feels weird to be running a 10TB mirrored NAS over a single USB cable. Maybe it's a common setup, and I'm just new to this, but I was looking for some reassurance.\n    submitted by    /u/Shadow-Prophet  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’m trying to help a couple friends get started in data hoarding and self hosting. Since I have a good stock of old spinners and the mini-PC’s that I am using don’t have internal SATA slots, I was hoping to buy some external enclosures for cheap to keep their costs down. I’d recommend that you keep a couple enclosures for Warranty returns but if you have extras let me know. Thanks for your time. If this post violates any rules, I am extremely sorry and will delete it immediately.\n Edit: I was asked to include my location since I am asking if people are willing to ship items. I am located in Florida USA. Thanks for checking out the post.\n    submitted by    /u/NotablyNotABot  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just thought I would share my experience if it helps others in Australia with a similar experience.\n I shucked a Seagate 5TB Hard Drive I purchased from Amazon Australia on July 2022. It was in my Unraid server and now refuses to power up at all, completely dead. \n I tried to use the return process on the Amazon site, but it doesn't work since its outside of the 30 day return window. Since the drive itself has a 2 year warranty, I contacted chat. They gave me a standard auto reply of \"You need to go back to the manufacturer for the warranty\" which is not how it works in Australia (in Australian consumer law, the retailer cannot refer you to the manufacturer or importer for warranty repairs). I replied with this information, and the chat officer offered to have someone higher up call me on my phone.\n I received the phone call, and the phone support was perfectly fine. I told them I needed to return a drive for warranty, but it was outside of the 30 days, but still has a 2 year warranty, and that I am in Australia, and purchased from Amazon Australia and needed to use them for the warranty. He accepted it straight away, and sent me a brand new 5TB Seagate Drive (he asked if I wanted a refund or replacement, but since I use it I went with replacement).\n All done and dusted, completely swapped under warranty! Not sure how it works in other countries, but in Australia the manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that shucking the drive caused the failure before they can reject a warranty, and retailer are required to work with the consumer to facilitate the warranty process (they cannot refer to manufacturer).\n If you are in Australia and need to refer to the specific detail around manufacturers warranties, just send them this: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-bought/repair-replace-refund-cancel\n    submitted by    /u/holastickboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can get this one for 60 because of a discount.\n Any one can recommend any of these, or anything else? I am open to suggestions.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/A-_-ok  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow Denizens of r/DataHoarder\n I just bought 2x14tb WD drives, that I'm adding to my NAS, which is running OMV. It currently only has an 8tb drive in it, on EXT4, which is almost out of space.\n I've been looking into snapraid-btrfs and snapraid-btrfs-runner.\n This and Mergerfs seems to be the perfect combination for my use case of mainly media storage(and maybe a steam cache later) on mixed drive sizes.\n But this is my first time even having enough data/drives to even have to worry about parity/bitrot, so i want to make sure I do it right the first time.\n I have a few things I want to make sure I'm understanding properly.\n 1) So in Snapraid, a 'Sync' is basically creating/updating the parity data on the parity drive. Does updating a parity file go faster if little to nothing has changed on the data drives?\n 2) Snapraid 'Scrubs' periodically check the integrity of a file based off of the Parity data, and timestamp. Still don't exactly get how this one works\n 3) Snapraid Sync will fail if anything is writing to the drives. Snapraid-btrfs gets around this by having Snapraid take a snapshot of btrfs's Read Only snapshots. No idea if that's correct.\n 4) Using Mergerfs and btrfs on my 8tb + 14tb drives, I can fill each drive rather evenly, without striping files. I can use my second 14tb to store the parity file created by Snapraid-btrfs. This should be pretty protected against bitrot, and the rare drive failure, right?(other than files lost between a sync and a failure)\n Sorry this is so long winded. I appreciate any insight :)\n    submitted by    /u/SmolMaeveWolff  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried compressing a small 49GB set with 7zip and it compressed to 12GB. These are the RAW files that aren't used too often (they are mostly processed and the processed version is what we used. however, since they are data, we want to keep the raw files too). Is there any downside to compressing the raws, and deleting the raws after to save space? I saw couple of posts but most dealt with low compression ratios and not worth it. But i think saving 60-70% in my case might be. I am just worried about unforseen comsequences i might not be aware of.

          "description": "I am sorry, I am new in all of this and I am not from english speaking country, so I apologize if I say something incorrect.\n I would like to ask you for a advice, because I am bit lost in this scenario:\n In my computer, I have this three drivers, encrypted by BitLocker: \n  \nA: 500GB SSD - Samsung 860 EVO\n B: 1TB HDD - WD 1003FZEX\n C: 10TB HDD - WD 102KRYZ\n  \nOS: Windows 11 Pro\n Motherboard: MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4\n Would it be possible, to mirror the drive A to the drive C through some kind of a software, where if needed, I would create a basic partition on the drive C so it would be the same size with the drive A. The same scenario I would like to use for the drive B to C, same as A to C. But the data on drive A are the most critical for me and I would like them to survive the trial of time with naively ideally no corruption and so on.\n I understand backups are vital in this, but one of the problems at this time is money, so unfortunately right now, something like NAS is out of question for me. (Note: The 102KRYZ. It was a gift from colleague of mine.) Second problem is, if bit rot happens, even with backups, I will have no idea about it and the backups would get overwritten through time, so ideally, the software for the mirroring should check for checksum, if I understand it correctly.\n Space in the PC is basically taken, so adding later another 500GB SSD would be a bit difficult. Thats why I would like to ask about this scenario and how I could utilize the setup I have to the best of capabilities in protecting my data. \n If this scenario is impossible, then maybe, is there a software for just plainly generating checksum and warning the user, if the files gets corrupted, so you could overwrite it from the backup from other drivers? Just a thought.\n I will be very thankful for any idea, answer or anything to my problem. Thank you if you read my post and If I may, I wish you a very nice day.\n    submitted by    /u/_GreyHeart_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not new to building PCs but don't consider it a hobby, just something I do in order to have a PC.\n I'm building for a new work rig (high end editing/creation), and putting 3x 6TB Ironwolf drives in there for storage of mostly photo and video files along with SSDs for files currently being worked on.\n I don't want to be playing around all day with the RAID setup, I just want something that works and will allow me to recover if one of the drives die. And yes I know that RAID is not backup! The important files are going in the cloud, also it's not critical data to start with (once the jobs are delivered).\n I'm really attracted to the idea of just using windows storage spaces in parity mode, especially now that I found this article and this one shamelessly ripped off the prior article with no credit but does conveniently have the numbers I'd need for my 3 disk setup to run with better speeds, because let's be honest it was NOT easy wrapping my head around the original article.\n Am I right that this is the right solution for a data noob like myself with my 3 disks? What else should I consider that doesn't involve becoming an expert? Things like TrueNas etc just seem like they're way above my paygrade, and I get conflicting information on hardware raid controller PCI cards (e.g. that it would be difficult to recover in case the card itself dies).

          "description": "Hi! Newbie from Mexico here. I own a Synology DS413j with 3 Western Digital 6TB drives and one Seagate 3 TB using Synology Hybrid Raid. The problem is that this NAS has a very small CPU, very little RAM, so it is really S-L-O-W. Even when doing a small backup from my PC to the NAS, on a 100Mbps network (not even 1Gbps), the CPU jumps to almost 100%. Also, since it's a \"j\" (junior) version I can't run docker or anything else in it.\n So, I'm planning to replace it, and I have 2 options (of course, if you have a better one, I'm all ears).\n Option A: A new Synology Model (\"+\" plus version), with 4 or 5 bays. This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.\n Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. \n My main usage is:\n a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)\n b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)\n c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)\n d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.\n e) As my own personal \"Evernote\", with DS Note on android and windows.\n What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BarajasFernando  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks Autocorrect. \n So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.\n The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.\n Everything running on Plex.\n So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.\n Obviously I can (and have) \"optimized\"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?\n Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?\n Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.\n Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.\n Any pointers would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/slvneutrino  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm wondering what the best way to edit video metadata is. My current method works just fine but it's SOOOOO slow and I'm looking for a better method. Currently I've got a bunch of .mp4 files with data written to the Title and/or Comment fields that I want to replace. I mostly just want to put my movie title in and nothing in the comments field. The name of the file is in Plex format \"%Title% (%Year%)\". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.\n My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas?

Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.\n I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.\n I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.\n The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.\n Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!\n Whats next?

After a couple hours I figured it out:\n yt-dlp --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s \n From my understanding this will do everything you need along with populating a json file that contains info like keywords on the video, upload date etc. You can open it in Firefox. If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:\n yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sunshinesontv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nI'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?\n \nAlso, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.\n \nlastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?\n \n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/machineglow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m totally stumped by this one. I figure if anywhere has experience with this kind of thing, it’s probably this sub. The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. \n So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). \n Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. \n So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. \n What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time \n Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/HotEukaryoticMitosis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but here goes.\n A bit context: I have (had) an Acer Nitro Laptop, which has a 1 TB HDD, to which I added a 256 GB SSD for OS. I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.\n A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.\n The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.\n Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.\n Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. \n And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.\n PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.\n    submitted by    /u/rbn_juicepop  \n [link]   [comments]",

This gives me enough space to consolidate my data on lots of smaller drives into a single server and get rid of either my 2014 Unraid build or Synology DS918+.

I'm more confident using the DS918+ and day-to-day that tends to be the device I use more frequently, but I figure the DS918+ is now end-of-life and the stats suggest I'm getting marginally better performance from the Unraid, not to mention future value.\n Is this a no-brainer? Or should I consider keeping the DS918+?\n My total data is only about 25tb, so the 3 x 18tb drives will be sufficient; leaving a spare bay even in the synology.\n Grateful for thoughts.

Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. \n Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. \n Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. \n Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. \n Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/rlsoundca  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think it is also very possible that it may of gotten wet from the hoses but this was about 3 months ago so dry now. If i plug it in to retrieve data am i risking damaging it?

I have a script I wrote that backed up data, logged in, and sent pretty HTML emails with status.\n For complicated reasons, I am getting rid of my Linux server and moving everything to my daily driver Windows 10 machine.\n I don't have time or patience to write a new script. I know I can use my old Linux script using WSL or something but I'm hoping for something more native to Windows.\n I was looking at alternatives to rclone that are easier to use on Windows like GoodSync but, honestly, when I do research, everyone says they all have issues and rclone is the best (it is).\n I don't want to re-create the wheel. I feel like this is a common problem that someone must have solved.\n If not, I feel like there is a huge opportunity here for someone to wrap a pretty basic GUI around rclone for Windows.

          "description": "Hello fellow hoarders \n After buying the DS920+ from Synology last month to replace my good old 10 or 11-year-old Thecus N2200 with 2x 1 TB, the time has come to buy the drives.\n At the moment, I have inside the DS920+, 3x 2 TB units + 1 TB unit.\n My idea in buying the NAS, is to have an easy place where to put my family photos, back up from the phones to the NAS automatically (ditching google photos), use a surveillance station with 2x cameras and the extra space is for building a media library.\n I thought to buy 2 big units, shuck them, and put them inside the NAS in SHR RAID type; at the same time, put one 1 TB drive plus one 2 TB drive that came out of the NAS, inside the cases where the big drives came, connect them to RaspPIs with Rsync, one at my home other at brother-in-law, to automatically back up the family photos folder which I don't want to lose.\n ​\n After looking at disk prices .com I found the 2 best deals at Amazon DE are the 18 TB Western Digital Elements units at €16.06/TB (€289) and the second-best deal is the WD My Book 16 TB at €16.5/TB (€264). \n After reading around some older threads in the sub, I see some fellow hoarders point out the fact My Book has hardware encryption, making it not desirable to shuck and put it in the NAS. My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?\n My second question is, what drives are normally in?\n I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. \n In your opinion, is this achieveable?\n Are there any deals I should look into? \n What would you buy nowadays?\n    submitted by    /u/Oinq  \n [link]   [comments]",

The goal with those is to keep the HDDs from spinning up every time the pool is accessed (for both a power and a noise perspective). I'd like for it to automatically shuffle data around periodically based on usage (i.e. most-used data stored on the SSDs).\n Is there anything that supports this? (Ideally with a nice GUI - nothing in Linux ever seems to \"just work\" from the command-line) I've messed around with TrueNAS in the past, but it doesn't seem like it can do any of what I'm mentioning (it cannot let the HDDs go to sleep (or something along those lines), cannot shuffle data around based on usage, and you can only use SSDs as a \"cache\" where the data is offloaded to the HDDs instead of having mirrored SSDs that actually store information).\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

They are in the process of upgrading it to an actual Apple Server but it is a slow process due to cost. \n The problem is, they have 4 external hard drives that are used for backup purposes. Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.\n I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available.

Raid config is RAID 10 + 1 hot spare and four more drives on hand to swap in for failures. I am not afraid to cut holes in this case. \n I've also posted this over on homeserver, but the level of jank I'm striving for fits a lot better here I think. \n I'm currently working on building a home file server that could potentially host both Plex and Pi-Hole. I've already got the drives on the way but I have not ordered the rest of the hardware. Right now I am bidding on an auction for an Optiplex 7040 MT, i7-6700 with 8GB RAM. There will be a dedicated SSD for the OS. I know that the specs will be sufficient for any of the individual uses, but will they be enough for all three at once? Also, what would be the best way to install 11 drives? I'm not afraid of jank, so \"creative\" solutions are welcome. My array plans are for 11 2TB drives with 10 TB logical storage for full parity with 1 hot spare. I will also have 4 cold spares. Here are the solutions I'm looking for ideas on: 1. software.

Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.\n I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.\n The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. \n What do you guys think about this current workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/FatherOfTheSevenSeas  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two other variants of that linked one above (\"i\" and \"e\" suffixes) have one or two 5.25\" bays, but can't fit a deep power supply like that \"a\" variant.\n I don't intend to have dozens of drives hooked up daily or anything. I just want three to four 5.25\" bays available for 1) a Blu-Ray drive, 2) at least one 3.5\" hot-swap bay, and 3) at least one 2.5\" hot-swap bay.\n So I'm wondering if it's possible to have a separate case mounted directly above or below the linked one, and run the SATA and power cables to it (plus extra fans, I assume) for these drives?\n This subreddit just introduced me to \"JBOD\" (funniest acronym ever?), but even with that hint, most of what I'm finding is still into four figures. I'm literally just looking for a 1-2U piece with a handful of 5.25\" bays that wouldn't be too difficult to link into from the other piece.\n Anyone have ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Weirderal1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

We previously had some DROBO units but due to downsizing we got rid of the server they were attached to and the units basically bricked when we tried to update the firmware with the intent of moving and repopulating them. So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. \n I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? \n To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this, as my research consistently leaves me with as many questions as answers.\n    submitted by    /u/Hydroc777  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently the solution is more important than the cost TBH bceasue I'm looking for a set and forget scenario.\n I'm hoping others can describe solutions if in a similar situation. I was thinking of the following:\n Option 1: Setup a macOS system to do the syncing. Setup OneDrive and iCloud Drive to \"keep all files locally\" and then rsync between the two folders. \n Pros:\n  \nnative syncing of iDrive\n  \nCons:\n  \nmy macOS laptop for this \"application\" is a bit old (2013 rMBP) which is currently unsupported. I don't want to run unsupported OSes for security reasons and I don't want workarounds, especially when settings this up for the next few years;\n dedicated Apple Hardware to do the task, whereas Windows VMs might do the trick;\n Unable to check if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and healthy. When OneDrive might fail, it could desync, but worst case scenario I think it could completely wipeout \n  \nOption 2 Run a Windows VM, signed in to iCloud Drive and OneDrive, both setup to keep all files on device.\n Pros:\n  \ncheapest and most portable\n  \nIssues:\n  \nas above, unable to automcatically check and resolve if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and sync is healthy.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/blucafee80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Important stuff!!. She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.\n Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive. But is this the right way? She doesn't know where all his stuff was stored and doesn't want to miss anything I'm sure there's more than just in the \"documents\" folder. How can I ensure I get everything that may be on the rig worth saving?\n I've done some googling on backup software and sounds like I can achieve doing that. I guess I just want to be sure that it is the right approach?? And will I be able to give my sister a drive with a file dump? Is something like that achievable?\n Does backup software just grab entire OS? Or can I grab just every file? Sorry for the long winded post.

It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.\n Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.\n So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).\n So, I could use some guidance on:\n 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?\n 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?\n 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?\n 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this?
