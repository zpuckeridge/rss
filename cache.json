Whatsapp has their own copy, Telegram has their own copy, Google has their own..and then there's my phone. \n Three things I need help with. 1) Deciding on what contacts are for. 2) Deduplicating contacts 3) Maintaining good house keeping habits for contacts\n For 1, I feel contacts should be a somewhat maintained list of \"people I feel I may want to reach out to\". I am unsure if it should extend to \"people who will want to reach out to me\". That way, I get rid a lot of noise, I reduce situations where I contact a stranger cause he/she picked up the old number of an acquaintance. Im just curious if there's any lost to losing people's contact. It happens all the time right?\n For 2, what's a good way to deduplicate them on all platforms? I have started with the contacts in Google. I went through each contact, cleaned up and standardized the data fields. Moving onto Telegram, I see a tonne of repeats. I feel I should sync between the curated Google contact list and Telegram, pray for some magic deduplication, and then sort through the rest again. Rinse and repeat for Whatsapp, then phone. Thing is, I'm unsure how the syncing works and if it will result in many more duplication on all involved platforms. There's v little visibility into which way the sync occurs. If it's 'To Google contacts', I can see what's out of place and edit accordingly. But anything else, manual curation and I'm bound to make mistakes cause I'm human.\n For 3, really, how do you do it?\n    submitted by    /u/pestlemortar  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing is, I started using it only to build a PUBLIC form ; then it just showed me all the possibilities for all the workflow automation, all the admin functionnalities I could create for my compagny. But I've learnt -the hard way- that Budibase really isn't meant to build ant kind of app that has a public side.\n So I have two options : either I use my website (ghost) for the content and Budibase for data management and workflow ease / automation AND a form builder like limesurvey for the forms or I find something that can do both what Budibase can and can't do. Honnestly, two softwares is already enough softwares. I'd rather not use three.\n Is there anything that would fit the requirement ? I prefer open source but I can consider paid services if they're cheap bithout limiting functionalities to the bare minimum (like 500 submitions per months for 20$ and this kind of nonsense).\n Thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/gregfdzd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have a bunch of dockerized services. Most of them are setup with a self-signed certificate to work via https, so chrome shuts up whenever I visit them. There are two problems with this: It's a pain in the ass and some services just refuse to do SSL.\n Reverse proxies to the rescue, right? There even is this docker image, that promises to magically do the job: https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy But then I have to deal with a bunch of DNS crap. My router knows that \"pi\" is supposed to be 192.168.178.3, but has no idea what nextcloud.pi is supposed to be.\n So as far as I know I could either buy a domain with subdomains or I could host my own DNS. I tried the adguard home docker image to host my own DNS and could even resolve the nslookup when explicitly told to resolve via the selfhosted DNS, but my router does not like that. I configured the router to use my selfhosted DNS for DNSv4 requests, but left the DNSv6 on default, since I don't think I can assign a static IPv6 to my raspberry pi that runs the DNS. I believe it is using that DNSv6 server, though. Also, I don't want to have no working internet whenever my raspberry pi has issues, so I don't like doing it this way.\n At this point I tried going the simple route: Just tell Chrome to shut the hell up whenever I go to that one server. But it seems like that also just will not work. \n So do I have to buy a random domain to get this to work? That seems no less annoying. Is there no better way? Am I getting anything wrong? Should I just switch to Firefox?\n    submitted by    /u/SendMeOrangeLetters  \n [link]   [comments]",

So the backlog is pretty big - and many memorable memories are hidden within.\n I looked at Damselfy but it seems to be geared more towards photographers, not for point-and-shoot type photography like random ol' me just snapping a picture because of something happening.\n Do you know of one that can: - Iterate through all my files and organize them by their (EXIF, largely) metadata? - Has an Android app so I can view them when on the go? (Yes, my hosted instance will be available outside through a Nebula VPN setup.) - Optionally recognize and thus \"tag\" pictures by faces?

For version 1.3.0 I focused on self-hosting.\n It should be your own choice where you want to host your code and your application. And this was something a really disliked on Heroku, that you can only deploy from GitHub.\n I'm happy to announce that Kubero now supports\n  \nGitLab\n Gitea\n Gogs\n Bitbucket\n GitHub.\n  \nYou can now automatically deploy your apps with a git push\n from any of these git providers. It does not matter if it's hosted on codeberg.org or gitlab.com or your self-hosted instance.\n I hope you like it, and if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other git repositories, please let me know.\n PS: Onedev was also planned, but I was not able to find any API documentation. I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. It is still on my roadmap.

I have tried Navidrome and generally find it inferior to Airsonic, with very little interest in using it as my main player. \n My goal would be to be able to queue up music from my phone to play in various rooms throughout the house. \n I like the ability to control each room's volume from my phone (like Google home, however their multi room audio has been terrible since they lost the Sonos lawsuit. I don't even bother with it anymore) as well as toggling rooms on and off. If it was possible to send different streams to different rooms simultaneously, that would be incredible. \n Lastly I might be interested in Home Assistant integration, though it's not a requirement.

The Update contains some new features, optimizations and a few fixes. Check out the Changelog for the full list of changes. Below some highlights of the new update:\n Recurring Transactions & Split:\n It's now possible to manually split a Bank Transaction for multiple Buckets. In addition, if the amount assigned to a Bucket is lower than the Transaction itself, the remaining amount is displayed. Creation of Recurring Transactions has been added too. This is useful if you mainly add your Bank Transactions manually instead of importing txt/csv files.\n Themes:\n Themes are now supported. Visit Bootswatch for more details. To select a theme use the new option APPSETTINGS_THEME as docker environment variable or in the appsettings.json file.\n Import Page Redesign:\n Import page got some slight redesign. You can now switch between all steps in an accordion view, where each section is enabled depending on your input.\n As usual any kind of feedback is highly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/The_Axelander  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I found the reddit self-hosted forum, and there were many comments about memos. The most mentioned one was dark mode, so we did our best to make a usable and readable version of dark mode.\n 👇 Here is the new version of memos with dark mode. Please enjoy.\n Dark mode in memos v0.8.1\n BTW. Personally, I really like services that support self-hosted, like trilium, mastodon and so on. From the first day when I created the repo of memos, I decided that it should be permanently free and open source, and mainly support self-hosted.

          "description": "My guess: the answer is no (but I am still happy to hear your thoughts).\n I have somewhat around ~20 IMAP email accounts (more like ~50 when you count all the aliases) with different domains, servers and whatnot. It's always a hassle when something changes to also update my email clients on various computers, smartphones and so on. Also: I have a laptop for work on which I don't want to install a private email client. \n The obvious answer to my \"problem\" is to have a webmail client which has access to all my IMAP mailboxes ... but I am not sure if I am comfortable with putting a service out there that can access all my personal data. I have basic knowledge of IT security and high respect of selfhosting critical applications on internet-connected machines. \n As convenience is always kinda opposed to security, I guess, my question is: how big is the risk when using something like RoundCube on a VPS? Can I easily harden it to a degree that it is still comfortable to use but also secure (enough)? How can I test security and monitor dangers like automated attacks or hacking attempts? Is it a good balance between secure and convenient to not host on a public VPS but on a sever that is only reachable via VPN/wireguard/tailscale...?\n TL;DR: How would you set up a webmail client that has access to all your mailboxes in a way that makes you feel safe?\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

Hope I have the correct subreddit for my question :)\n I have an old pc that runs docker and manage it through portainer. Looking at lots of YouTube video's how to savely expose my Nextcloud instance. Well, I found a very interesting option called Cloudflare Zero Trust. No need to open ports on my router and use a proxy for save connection.\n I have setup a tunnel with a subdomain nextcloud.mydomain.com with service HTTP and url 192.168.x.xx:8080. After that created an application that bypasses my home ip. Now I can access Nextcloud via http://nextcloud.mydomain.com. Till now I get it and works, but my question is...\n Is using HTTP a bad thing? Is the connection between the browser and cloudflare HTTPS and between cloudflare and my server HTTP?\n Hope someone might explain a bit more and if there are any tips how to improve the setup.

As much as I hate this scenario, I figured maybe someone might help me out and this would be a good reference for someone as well.\n ​\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BackToPlebbit69  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I've recently started creating an managing websites, so now I have to setup mailboxes for my clients. I use a separate cPanel account for every clients, and use that to setup the mailboxes, and it is working fine.\n What is troubling me is that as a user I always assumed the content of my email messages was encrypted and hidden even to the system admin and didn't suspect I, as an admin, could access freely my client's mailboxes. I assumed this was why you send a link to ask them to set their own password. However, disregarding on how the password is choosen, I simply have to click \"Check mail\" in cPanel to access whatever I want.\n I understand this is because I'm using client's cPanel to set their mailboxes, but they would never be able to do the job by themselves, so I guess I have no other option.\n Unfortunately, when dealing with one particular client, I also assured them I cannot access their email accounts. Now I'm pretty sure this is not even legal, and it looks like a huge privacy flaw to me.\n So, how can this be normal?\n Is there a way to avoid being able to access my clients' mailboxes?\n Thank you very much!\n    submitted by    /u/sblanzio  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Wanted to share what we've been working on at Grist. We've been experimenting with AI-generated Python formulas to help everyday spreadsheet users write formulas in spreadsheets. Why? Spreadsheets are the original low-code platform – sprinkle in a little bit of code and you get a big benefit. But that little bit of code can be daunting for some. What if AI could bridge the gap between what the user needs a formula to do, as expressed in plain English, and the correct formula?\n While AI spreadsheet formula writing is not new, Grist has two benefits:\n  \nGrist supports Python formulas in the spreadsheet. Current AI models are quite good at writing Python code, and getting better. As a bonus, by writing formulas in Python, this tool could help spreadsheet users learn Python, a more universal and capable language than traditional spreadsheet functions.\n A Grist document is a relational database with its schema neatly described in Python in Grist's \"Code View,\" which is available to the bot, helping it make inferences.\n  \nWe tested the experiment using formulas from our template gallery to approximate real use cases. The AI-generated formulas were correct 36 out of 48 times in the minimal experiment dataset. You can view the results of that test here: https://public.getgrist.com/n3jAtRYDSVWe/AI-Formula-dataset\n And a gif to show it in action! \n https://i.redd.it/2tlx5xfl953a1.gif\n While this feature is not yet a part of Grist for the everyday spreadsheet user, we wanted to share the experiment's code with self-hosters who might want to play with it.\n  \nSource code: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/pull/345\n Documentation: https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core/blob/formula-prompt/documentation/llm.md\n \n If you're unfamiliar with Grist, here's a recap from an earlier Reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/su6tv3/grist_free_open_source_alternative_to_airtable/\n    submitted by    /u/anaisconce  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which implies my domain name does point towards my debain machine. So im completely stuck. Installed and reinstalled pleroma and nginx and even the OS a few times. \n Any help or ideas would be appreciated, I am new to linux and networking.\n    submitted by    /u/timcoe4  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Dear reddit,\n My name is Rodolfo Berrios and I'm an indie developer from Chile.\n I created an image sharing software called Chevereto (username checks out) which I introduced in 2007. Chevereto enables to create your own image sharing website. Pretty much like your own Imgur/Flickr/etc. It is made to replace the need for these services and cheaply run it on your servers. The idea came when ImageShack removed pictures that I was hot-linking at online forums and here we are after all these years.\n Chevereto is a family company, I'm in charge of the software and my wife does marketing. We are a small team and we love what we do.\n I'm posting here to introduce our new free edition, AGPLv3 licensed, now available at chevereto/chevereto. This edition is focused in personal usage and it is on pair with our paid releases.\n Hope you can give it a try and thanks for reading!\n P.S. You can learn more about this new Chevereto free edition in a post I wrote at my blog.\n    submitted by    /u/chevereto  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi!\n I've been hosting a few http services both in my Pi at home, and in a public cloud and I don't like the VPN way of accessing my services. Sometimes I need to browse my server in a friends computer or phone, and it gets messy or impractical, so I end up exposing the services to the public web sometimes. I worry quite a bit about forgetting to update my software and finding my server being used to host sketchy bank scams.\n What I have been thinking of doing is blacklisting every IP in my nginx reverse proxy, but allowing a single HTTP endpoint to be accessed, like \"allow.domain.com\", where after receiving any http request, it would add the origin IP into the whitelist for a set amount of time (a few hours). I would also setup geoblock to only allow the endpoint to be accessed from my country.\n The point is that I don't need a super locked-down set up, I just want the peace of mind that my server is not just visible to anyone. If I am at work I can authorize my ip for a few hours just by accessing a simple endpoint, if I want to share a file with a friend I can forward them a link without having to worry about setting up a VPN connection for them, just letting them know they first have to go to allow.domain.com before trying to open my link every few hours or days. \n Is that ok? I searched a bit to see if there's something like this prod. ready but I couldn't find. I know it's still the single point of failure of the http service being open to the web, and the fact that it's a bit \"security through obscurity\", but I just need something to give a little reassurance and more security than just being blindly open to the world.

First reason, chalenge, i don’t have much infra/system/server/network experience, i have a beginning diploma but I don’t have the school smarts to continue. Second reason, fun, I like tech, always have and I love having these kind of projects. Third, privacy, in my tech journey I’ve discovered how messed up compagnies handle your data and i don’t like it. Fourth and important one for this post, I kind of want to put this in my resume somehow, might even be a part of my resume, or even could be the full resume if I can somehow.\n So, my actual question is : since i want my self hosting on my resume, and i know that in entreprise level hosting, they mostly use Kubernetes and not docker (wich i am currently using but can change that, I’m not toi far yet) should I and can I use Kubernetes on my main and only server as a server with no Kubernetes clients attached to it, I might and probably will attach more servers to it in the future but for now is it actually doable and is it worth it ? I could also make multiple VMs in my main server and cluster those together but i know that doesn’t go too well with the Kubernetes philosophy so not too sure what to think about that. Anyway, I’m waiting on all of your opinions to see what i can/should do, thanks !\n    submitted by    /u/Luckeysthebest  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is made in .NET Framework 4.7.2 so it needs an application called Mono to run. In case anyone doesn't know, Mono is a conversion layer to run .NET Framework applications on Linux.\n Now on the same VM i'm trying to run another console application i wrote, but this one is written in .NET 6. This version of .NET does not need mono anymore, so my exe should be able to run natively (as long as i have the .NET 6 packages installed which i do). However Mono has hijacked my './' command so now when i try to run the .NET 6 exe i get a mono error.\n What i want to achieve is to be able to run the .NET 6 normally, and explicitly use the 'mono' command when i want to run older .NET framework exe's. I don't want it to run mono when i use the './' command. How can i achieve this?\n    submitted by    /u/YourNightmar31  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I can, let's say, have now 3 machines but in the future add some more and manage their containers from some UI or something.\n Thanks in advance.\n EDIT: After seeing lots of comments and wrapping my head around Portainer, Kubernetes even Podman, I think for now I'm going to go with Portainer because:\n 1- It seems simpler, since it's just Docker and I've been using that for the past months\n 2- Kubernetes seems more suitable when you need to manage a cluster and big stuff, add like HA to your services, and overall, too complex for my use case. However, I really liked the idea, and I'll definitely try it out for fun when I have some time\n 3- Also I've seen that regarding memory usage, Kubernetes tend to hog more than plain Docker, and that's a concern for me since I plan on using Raspberrys for now (or at least until I have enough money to get a decent home server)\n Thanks again to all of you that commented, I have still a lot to learn!\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeRabid  \n [link]   [comments]",

The tutorial says open http://papermerge.local for sign in in papermerge, but I can't reach the website. So I tryed the IP-Address from the portainer server, with no results. In portainer I don't have a port for the papermerge-frontend container. I don't no to reach papermerge. Can you help me?\n    submitted by    /u/_akadawa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just because this version works on PHP7.4 you are still encouraged to use PHP8 instead though\n Updated all the composer and npm dependencies (the latter of which are generally only used in dev)\n Lots of bugs fixed, including one that has been around for 3 years, where cookies would expire and the user would be left with an error 500. Turns out this was an issue when people were running multi-user, it's now finally fixed!\n Some basic keyboard navigation has been added.\n MySQL and PostgreSQL are both now officially supported in addition to SQLite.\n Stop polling when the API returns an error.\n Added a bunch of translations, some of the strings had to be google translated as some were missing though.\n A bunch of fixes have been applied to apps, such as the password field should work properly now.\n There is also a background job that updates old config files if newer ones have been released.\n Private apps and app development has been fixed\n There are instructions for running without external access to the app, however things like automatically downloading icons wont work in that case. This is also experimental, so let us know if we can improve this.\n Doing a tile search will now open the first item in the search results instead of returning an error.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ls_kode  \n [link]   [comments]",

For some context, I have a huge library of artworks and content of different artists online (some might call that Linux ISOs). I have everything on my server, but I need a tool to easily view these from a browser.\n Those few photo management solutions that support existing directory structure, all have some kind of downside.\n - Nextcloud photos can't actually use the correct alphanumerical sorting and goes from \"1 (1).png\" to \"1 (10).png\" instead of \"1 (2).png\". The issue for that seems to be stale or just forgotten because it's open for like 3 years -.-\n - PhotoView has some problems with displaying large directories, as it makes giant database queries every time you switch a directory\n - Lychee is quite nice, but its import process is just too slow. With a library of around 300k images and videos, it takes for ever to import that once, but every consecutive one takes forever as well…\n - PiGallery2 is the only one that seems to be fast enough with what experience I want, but still some of the tasks in the background for indexing or general preview generation also takes a long time.\n ​\n Just to clarify, I don't need syncing to my phone or whatever other features solutions like Immich has. I just need something to quickly browse a giant library of photos and videos.\n Are there any solutions I haven't come across, that could help me in this case?\n    submitted by    /u/TheSeventhCode  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have Vikunja working in that the frontend and backend are running and working, it's sat behind an Nginx reverse proxy and I've been using it from the computer. I had it set up locally initially, until I secured it a bit and then added a subdomain on the host and allowed external access. Everything still works using the external FQDN and I also changed the URL in the env variables in Portainer.\n Trying it from an Android mobile (on the same network) using Opera/Chrome/Kiwi and the frontend loads but says it cannot connect to the backend. By default I still had the local LAN IP configured in the env variables. Changed this to the docker network address and also the external FQDN (after forwarding ports) and they all worked on desktop still but none of them worked on mobile. Changed the address on the error page the frontend loaded and also changed the env options in Portainer.\n I'm not sure what to look at now. As I said at the top, the frontend and backend are talking as it works on the desktop.\n    submitted by    /u/9100  \n [link]   [comments]",

One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.\n The new Appwrite Console in v1.1\n Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.\n To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.\n In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:\n 🖥️ Dashboard\n 🔐 Authentication\n 💽 Databases\n 🪣 Storage\n ⚡ Functions\n 🧙 New Wizards\n ... and more!\n Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.\n We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI.

Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.\n For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.\n 40k photos in one view\n Progress update as of 11/22/2022\n tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.\n Some of the major new features:\n Live Photo Support\n  \nThanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.\n HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.\n  \nVideo Transcoding\n  \nMemories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.\n Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1\n  \nMultiple Timeline Folders\n  \nFor maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.\n You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)\n  \nServer side encryption\n  \nIf you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore\n  \nNew metadata sidebar\n  \nYou can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar\n  \nNew photo viewer\n  \nWith some fancy UX. Try it out ;)\n  \nThe full changelog can be found here.\n If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊\n    submitted by    /u/radialapps  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.\n I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.\n Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.\n At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?\n    submitted by    /u/Chaos_Therum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.\n Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.\n 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.\n  \nHuginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nautomatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted (for now).\n  \nn8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.\n  \nHosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.\n  \nBeehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nPower Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.\n  \nHosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).\n ---\n I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.\n 👇 Links to these tools in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/usamaejazch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.\n I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).\n I have the following setup:\n  \nCloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.\n \nNginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.\n \nOpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.\n \n I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.\n Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.\n    submitted by    /u/xViMeSx  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I also see some people be a little bit bummed out by the lack of devices on the free plan. Well fear not as tailscale has a plan which is made for open-source projects to use, and also for friend/family use. The Github Community Plan.\n This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. \n Step 1: Create a github account\n Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)\n Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.\n Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with \"Select Network\" as it should be under the \"Multi-user tailnet\" banner.\n Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the \"Github Community Plan\".\n Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. \n Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.\n    submitted by    /u/Stetsed  \n [link]   [comments]",

Prometheus and all these databases seem like overkill. It should be as lightweight as possible (RAM usage, disk usage, dependencies).\n If such a thing does not exist yet, let me know if you'd be interested.

Is it possible to have 2 instances of NPM on 2 different machines using the same domain and cloudflare tunnels or do I need to get a 2nd domain?

I currently have 3 VLANS setup:\n  \nManagement - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc\n Home - My personal devices\n Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services\n  \nMy firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).\n I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.\n This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.\n Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?\n ​\n Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN?

I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. \n First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as \"animal\" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. \n Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members \"user level\" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. \n I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.\n It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server.

          "description": "first off.... the code + demo:\n Repository - includes a GIF demo \n What is AmbientWeather?\n AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.\n ​\n What does your tool do?\n Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. \n If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.\n ​\n Which weather stations are supported?\n Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.\n ​\n What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?\n What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.\n ​\n Anything else?\n So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups. If you give this tool a try and hit any issues, please be patient and feel free to open an Issue or post on the Discussion board.\n    submitted by    /u/philosowaffle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say \"2SV\", is not well implemented in their system.\n For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. \n So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/ChillPill89  \n [link]   [comments]",

Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. \n I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. \n Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this?

So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.\n Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.\n    submitted by    /u/Losoncziterimenekult  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm facing the issue that moving from one server to another (which shouldn't happen often, yet has to happen at some point), is a huge burden to even think about.\n So... the answer to this is... obviously, containerization, where we separate applications from data. Let's talk docker.\n However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.\n Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?\n Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.\n But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.\n How do you handle this issue? Do you have cron jobs that restart your containers every now and then and upgrade the images so that security fixes can come over?

It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.\n You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.\n Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.\n ​\n Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.\n    submitted by    /u/barinali  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:\n Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.\n Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.\n I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.\n From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.\n Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.\n (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)\n    submitted by    /u/mfsb-vbx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.\n It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.\n My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. \n Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line?

OpenVPN refuses to connect and Wireguard connects however I cannot search or directly connect to IPs (it does work on other networks.) Another thing I've noticed is that I'm able to connect to my Minecraft server, but not join as it cannot connect to Mojang's authentication servers. I'm not completely sure of how the block works though, since I am unable to connect to any VPNs on that port. Let me also point out, Hotspot Shield's \"Hydra\" protocol is able to bypass these blocks but I'm not paying for a VPN if I know there is some way out there to bypass these blocks.\n From what I know:\n The network has its own DNS, using Google's or Cloudflare's just results in a \"The connection reset\" page instead of the block placeholder page.

TLDR at the bottom\n Context: I was looking at setting up a couple services from scratch a few weeks ago and thought to myself, \"I wonder if I can just buy something with it already installed.\" So I've been looking into it and I personally have not been successful in finding any kind of seller that provides this (self hosting as a service?). I have played around the idea a bit in my head and I am of the belief that there may be a few that would be possible with this method of deployment. \n Those of you who have went through the pains of starting to self-host for the first time, or those of you that are just busy: Yes or no, please let me know!

There are great options for replacing the majority of what music services like Spotify or Apple Music do - Jellyfin, Plex, etc, supported by software like Lidarr and the like, to make it easy to self-host your music library, expand it, access it with ease from anywhere with a plethora of clients etc.\n The one thing that's missing, to my knowledge, is a discoverability/recommendation engine. Features like 'Daily Mix', dynamic playlists that encompass popular songs from a particular category, 'Discover Weekly' etc. These are IME very nice features for discovering new music and expanding your music library.\n Is there something out there that's usable with something like Jellyfin?

My god, it's almost too perfect.\n I'm not affiliated with this at all, I just love it when I come across a project that does one thing and does it well!\n Because of the one-way indexing I can completely destroy the Docker container and bring it all back up again without having to re-configure the world.\n I can't see any donate buttons on the site - how does one donate to such a project? I need to go share some financial love while I'm on this high.\n OK, OK, I'll stop gushing.\n    submitted by    /u/FluffyMumbles  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I can I share these /download for them.\n I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.\n My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.\n Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.\n The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/true_heart  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the outset I knew that deliverability would be an issue but now, even with all appropriate records set up (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, PTR) and server configured correctly, messages are still go straight to spam (GMail).\n My mail server is hosted by DigitalOcean and I've learned that entire ranges of their IP addresses have been blacklisted. I've tried assigning different Reserved IPs to mail server but so far it's no help. One obvious option is to try moving the mail server to a different provider entirely, but I'm not sure which providers have good reputation AND are cost effective AND will allow sending. I'm open to suggestions on this.\n Another option I was considering is using a third-party for sending since the larger players tend to have excellent reputation. But I'm not sure if this can work for my service. With services like SendGrid and MailGun, domains and senders need to be validated. My service allows users to create multiple profiles (senders) — I alone have ~180 — so limits on such services would probably be reached very quickly. If sending from custom domains these services require adding DNS records, but this wouldn't be appropriate in my case as the records would have references to the third-party domains.\n What would be the best option to ensure email delivery?\n Any useful suggestions welcome.

          "description": "Hi, \n I have been running my Unraid server for over a year now, with no knowledge going into it. I have learned a few things along the way with the help of guides, forums and reddit. \n Today I setup a reverse proxy so my friends could use Overseerr without exposing my IP address. It isn't that I didn't trust my friends, but mainly because my IP address changes so often from my IP that I didn't like getting messages that \"it's broken\". But I do know it is bad practice to let people know what your IP is.\n This is the first taste I have setting up a reverse proxy, though I setup Wireguard with Duck DNS to be able to access my server outside the network in the past.\n I believed I setup everything correctly in Nginx and applied the SSL certificate to the domain that was created for Overseerr. The only issue that I am running into is through Chrome I get an warning, \"Deceptive site ahead\". Edge and Firefox does not show this warning. After some googling people generally say that it is a Duck DNS problem, and after using no-ip to create a domain, it does appear that way as I get no warning when using the no-ip domain to access Overseerr. I don't want to use no-ip as you have to renew the domain every 30 days and I don't think I can set it up to automatically update my IP address when it changes (this could be a lack of knowledge). \n I was wondering if there is a way to fix this issue. Currently I have Overseerr, Duck DNS, and Nginx all as dockers inside my Unraid server. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/knoll126  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything seemed to work fine, but being rather new to docker, I was wondering if the SQL schema upgrade happens automatically? I thought you had to upgrade the database before running the new images, but for the life of me, could not find definitive info through my Google-Fu (which may be weak). Even the 2FA java plugin just worked fine. \n I looked through the docker logs of both new containers, but didn't see anything where any schema upgrade scripts were run. So, just wondering before I do the same to my production containers if this is how it is done.\n Thanks - appreciate the help.\n    submitted by    /u/Crafty_Dog_4226  \n [link]   [comments]",

This works fine for just launching the apps from NPM, but seems to cause issues w/ Authentik.\n I followed this tutorial to setup Authentik and I was able to get it working the first time, but haven't had luck since. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I seem to flip flop between 500 and 502 errors.\n I've looked up and down for more documentation, or youtube tutorials, but it doesn't seem like other folks are running into this same issue.\n I also do not understand the terminology despite reading the instruction - provider? outpost?\n My need is (hopefully) simple - I'd like to add authentication in front of applications that do not have it natively built in.

I'd really like to get a Xeon with at least 12 threads but I think I'll either need to go rack mount or a standard tower (or build my own).

A friend suggested to buy a Mikrotik router and plug it in my home router as there is an option to create an openvpn server. After some research I found out that some other routers have the same option as well. Pfsense seemed like a decent idea too.

I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.\n I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say \"home.laxweasel\" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.\n I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.\n However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.\n Thoughts/experiences?

          "description": "I use Traefik as my reverse proxy and really find that once setup it is super powerful, but I found a few issues with the direct docker integration so created a tool to try make it simpler for me, and think it may make life easier for others.\n https://github.com/qwacko/traefik-config-gen\n The key issues I wanted had were:\n  \nIntegration with docker containers on other hosts requires docker swarm.\n I felt that I was forever creating the same 8-10 labels on every container to make them work (but having to rename a bunch and hopefully make no errors).\n  \nPossibly there are different ways to solve these issued, but I created a tool that effectively hooks into the HTTP Provider that Traefik provides, and reads docker labels to generate a configuration based on a user defined template for Traefik to use. \n This doesn't make the setup of Traefik any easier (you need a working system in order for this to work), but once setup, this should save a bunch of time keeping every new container functioning correctly and consistently no matter which host you add it to. I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.\n This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.\n    submitted by    /u/qwacko  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.\n In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.\n Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).\n I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.\n TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise\n    submitted by    /u/DropkickFish  \n [link]   [comments]",

How can I make it so that any machine connecting to say $my-domain:1234/service gets served by the service listening on port 9090?\n I know I CANT set location /service to proxy_pass to http://127.0.0.1:9090 because 127.0.0.1 here refers to the pod running nginx (in particular, it isnt running the service I want to connect to). \n I thus tried to proxy_pass to http://$host-local-ip:9090 where $host-local-ip is something like 192.168.x.x, but now when I try to connect from a machine (call it A) outside the network, it seems nginx tries to service the requests from 192.168.x.x on the same network as machine A.

          "description": "Hi y'all,\n I work for a small business and we do regular print jobs for agents who we (the office admins) then charge at the end of the month. We've always kept a little paper binder to record the print jobs, quantity, what it's for, who it's for, and the cost per page, etc. I was wondering if there was some sort of open source self-hosted software for print logging/tracking/management or whatever you call it. \n I'd like to have the ability for admins to filter by agent or job and then print a report at the end of the month to charge them, so we don't have to add it up ourselves by the end of the month. I'd also like to have it specify who it's for, who the log was recorded by, basically exactly what our booklet does. Is there something like that out there? Would I be better off just making some sort of sort of shared spreadsheet lol?\n    submitted by    /u/sqomoa  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.\n Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.\n However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).\n This is what I've tried so far:\n ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } \n }\n server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server \"the-container-name\"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } \n } ```\n The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?\n I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.\n I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.\n    submitted by    /u/detuneattune  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. \n Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with. Uploading to photoprism via WebDAV is intuitive and works from phones or computers\n Feel free to ignore my options and just suggestion your own.\n    submitted by    /u/pulmonarypenguin16  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.\n Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/squirrelhoodie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.\n Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.\n Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/funfungo0dg0od  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. \n But there are a few basic things missing, like:\n - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata\n - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like \"turn image 90 degrees\")\n - simple file and folder operations like \"copy\" or \"move\"\n Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! \n But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. \n PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

You can easily run it on a slow machines (e.g. DigitalOcean basic droplet with 1vCPU & 1GB RAM) and still have a nice performance.\n Shelf is currently at the MVP stage and doesn't do much, other than stores your file, but it already supports S3-compatible storages (S3, Minio, DO Spaces).\n Feel free to try the cloud version or you can try to run it locally, it should as easy as running docker compose up\n Please, let me know what you think about the project\n https://preview.redd.it/comsdzr9r0z91.jpg?width=3442&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21b557fe5b25230d3fc4eedb68866afd8a98b01a\n    submitted by    /u/iamlocal  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.\n For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. \n Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.\n I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 \"trash can\" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).\n So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. \n A couple questions:\n What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?\n My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?\n I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).\n Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!\n Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.\n    submitted by    /u/docholoday  \n [link]   [comments]",

Using openvpn to my home network means that traffic is exposed to my home internet ISP. SO in this case I understand I could use a reverse proxy to solve it. Say using my phone > mullvad vpn > nginx (for example) > one of my docker containers. This would give applications a secure way to login without directly exposing them to the internet, right? Would it be possible to host this reverse proxy on the same server that hosts my services? Is this advisable or am I better off with a premade solution from say cloudflare? I do have access to one of those free oracle cloud instances but I think the download bandwidth is capped pretty low on them, while upload is not, so it would probably run out of data acting as a tunnel for all of my data, streaming 4k movies or whatever.

But i found a way to make this doable.\n The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.\n So the procedure:\n  \nCreate a new folder in your APP / Server, for example \"Mobile Photos\".\n Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload\n Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and \"Configure\".\n Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option \"The original file will....\".\n Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)\n Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.\n Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.\n  \nProblems:\n  \nFor some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.\n I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a \"Photo Folder\", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.\n  \nSo hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).\n My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.\n What I have looked at and dismissed:\n  \nHomechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras.

We primarily use it for our kids but we are slowly building out our own library via EBay and dollar bins. \n My thoughts were with the insane improvements to CPUs with the new generations that I should upgrade (first major upgrade ever). So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. \n So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). \n So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries.

I have been able to find workarounds, but I think it is time for me to get myself some self hosted photo/video app. \n And to do so, I thought of getting a NAS and install LibrePhotos or Photoprism (I'd need to see how they work to choose for one) or to directly use the NAS photo management system.\n The problem is, the documentation in both Photoprism and LibrePhotos ask as a requirement 3/4GB of RAM, which is not that common to have on a NAS (and if you find it it's paying a hefty sum). So my question is double:\n Users of these applications, what NAS are you using and how well does it work?\n If I get a 2GB RAM NAS, can I later upgrade it myself with RAM modules, or is it soldered and impossible to upgrade? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/galimats  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I already have a Plex server with a 5 TB hard drive. But I am thinking of expanding up to 10 TB but I want some redundancy like perhaps having two 10 TB in maybe RAID 1 mirror mode. My idea is that have two hard drives one acting as a backup. Performance is not a concern since most movies don't go past 1080P and there are no more than 3 concurrent streams. I use a hp g800 mini which is serving quite well and I have had no complaints with streaming or content quality drops even in different countries. \n Since performance isn't an issue my idea is I use Unix command line as the OS of the machine. The hard drives would be in NTFS format. I am wondering if there is any specific setup for this. Would I need some sort of NAS or a software solution that would be preferred without investing in additional hardware? Maybe someone has done something similar and could share a solution? \n Much appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/kingrun2  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been running my plex container directly on my TrueNAS server (an old octocore phenom amd cpu) to give it direct access to storage, this has worked well for me, but now I am considering some other options during this upgrade process.\n My new servers will be dual xeons with 22 cores on each CPU. I know this is far overkill for TrueNAS, so I started thinking, maybe I should keep truenas on the octocore and create a VM with access to the storage on the truenas over my back end network. I'm going to be using teamed 4 port gigabit nics on each of the servers I am building to provide good network thruput to my vm hosts from TrueNas where the VM disks will be stored\n If I put the docker container in a VM and host it on proxmox over the network, do you think I will get similar performance over the VM as I would directly on the truenas box?\n Really the question is, do I want to waste(?) all that CPU power on truenas with some docker containers, or host it in a VM and be able to throw as many cores/memory at it as I want and leave the truenas server on the octocore phenom? This will let me use the 2 xeon systems I am building strcitly as proxmox servers and leave the lower end box as just a nas instead of nas and docker.\n I hope this makes sense, my thinking feels a bit scattered, but I think I got my point across\n Any advice would be appreciated!\n Thanks!~Rick\n    submitted by    /u/RickoT  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am now aware of the raid controls on these servers. It has the Adaptec 5808 hba, which apparently can be flashed into IT mode to passthrough the HDDs. The drives on the onboard raid control can sometimes be seen by unraid but are showing as different drives than what the array was. My question, would it just be easier to just buy a compatable hba card for both of the backplanes? Will it then be just plug and play as if i was just moving the array to another PC? Also, Would any limitations of storage capacity be on the hba card or the backplane end? Most of my HDDs are currently 4tb but looking to upgrade to 6 or 8tb per drive. I am looking for the best way to move drives and be seen by Unraid with no new configuration. I can move the array from one pc to the next no problems.

I don't need large capacities. 1-2-4 TB is more than I would possibly ever need. This will be running on ZFS, I guess as a mirror.\n So the question - what should I pursue? The used DC drives? New ones? Optane? Or may be this is a viable option: https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-M-2-U-2-Adapter-SFF-8639/dp/B073W65QX6\n or this: https://www.amazon.com/ICY-DOCK-Tool-Less-SFF-8639-Converter/dp/B07T8LJY23\n An adapter for the M.2. That last option looks tempting, since M.2 drives are getting real cheap.

Currently have installed there a PDU, ethernet switch, router and power injector for internet access ODU installed on the roof of my house. On the bottom there is a plastic pipe (that goes under the ground to the street) where fiber would be placed in the future. In near future I plan to install also NVR for cameras and NAS for storage.\n ​\n Since I'm working remotely from home, I need backup power supply in case of power outage, that happens from time to time for couple of minutes. It is a problem when you are providing training online for bunch of people and network goes down :). I was looking for 10\" rack AC UPS, but there are none on the market. I was looking for modular UPS with external battery, but none for 10\" rack.\n ​\n Since all my current and future devices are DC powered I've decided to use buffer switch mode power supply unit. There are sockets for 230V AC input, 12V DC output, connectors for battery. Battery can perfectly fit at the bottom of the shelf where I had a free space (next to this pipe for fiber). PSU fits in standard 10\" rack 1U shelf with extra metal sheet wall in the front (custom build). I've installed also status LEDs that shows status of AC input, DC output, battery charge. I've installed fuse module with 4 outputs, so each of my devices have own fuse. One of devices works only with 9V, so I've installed also DC/DC converter from 12V to 9V. I've selected 12V 9Ah battery and set 1A charging current.\n ​\n Currently my devices consume at most in total 15W, so 9Ah battery is enough for 7h+. After I add planned devices it will increase to 45W, so battery would keep devices on for ~2h 30min. I plan to replace then a battery with bigger one.\n ​\n Here are some photos.\n Power supply for my 10\\\" rack\n ​\n Battery I've used\n ​\n How it looks before installation\n ​\n Houw it looks after installation\n Inside\n ​\n This is how it looks currently, free space is for future devices.\n    submitted by    /u/ThatsMyUsernameDear  \n [link]   [comments]",

However the markups on rasberry pi's are outrageous right now, and my search for an alternative led me here. Have a used Dell Wyze 5070 (16gb flash, 4gb ram, 1.5ghz quad core Celeron) thin client on the way.\n Assuming I won't be able to customize the xfinity combo modem to work for pihole. So I've pulled out my Asus N66U Black Knight router, planning on placing the xfinity in bridge mode and running that. Newest fw I could find was DD WRT from late 2020.\n Is that fw recent enough or should I be looking for a new router? While I'm sure the router is good enough for my miniscule needs I need it to be secure as possible.\n    submitted by    /u/NoGoodInThisWorld  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I live in a flat where my desktop PC (which I use for work) and the ISP router are at the absolute opposite corners, with multiple walls and doors between. Running Ethernet without drilling holes isn't possible due to some unfortunate obstructions.\n I moved here about ~3.5 years ago and, having resigned myself to a wireless existence, decided to get the best possible router and PCI-E WiFi card I could find. At the time, those were the Netgear Nighthawk R9000 and Asus PCE-AC88 respectively. In 2022, there is still nothing better than that Asus for 4x4 MIMO.\n Anyway, it all started very simple. ISP router in modem mode, and the Netgear doing all the heavy lifting:\n https://preview.redd.it/5hman0wpr54a1.png?width=2184&format=png&auto=webp&s=4882c5be0371398146ad3a4f92426df9ffe14782\n This served me well for quite a while and I've been able to achieve ~750Mbps between WAN and my desktop PC. Not quite maxing out the gigabit link, but close enough.\n Recently, I got the itch from this subreddit and decided to take advantage of some Black Friday deals and build my own OPNsense router. It took about a day to set everything up, but it turned out great! (pictures here)\n Around the same time, I also decided to build myself a Kubernetes cluster because 1- why not and 2- I've been meaning to play with it for a while. For that, I grabbed three ThinkCentre M92p Tiny PCs from eBay. These are great little machines with an i5-3470T, 16GB RAM and 128GB SSD. Not bad for £70 each!\n Overall, the network now looks like this:\n https://preview.redd.it/4moa9kekt54a1.png?width=3284&format=png&auto=webp&s=5640a50bc4a4d3cc6bdd299ec60ea1f9be2e9b6c\n I still have a lot to learn and experiment with, but I'm pretty happy with this setup.\n    submitted by    /u/callcifer  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "hi people! I'm preparing to move to a new house and i want to run cables from all the rooms from 3 floors. i calculated that up and down i would need 15m cables max from certain rooms. House (located in Europe) has pipes everywhere where i can run easily the cables. Do i really need to put solid cable as it doesn't really pass through walls ? The ideal would be full copper cables/cat6a/23AWG/solid/CMP and Poe++ needed for my various Unifi devices but a proper one from a reputable business vendor with all tests done, etc has around 50 eu. Is it worth it or i could go for a stranded/pure copper/26AWG/poe++/CM from the same vendor with around 15eu per cable ? i know it would cost me probably cheaper to buy a roll and do it myself but i don't really have the time to punch down every single cable and test it separately and i would prefer a ready made solution.\n    submitted by    /u/sessho86  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently run an entry level Netgear ReadyNAS which is approaching near 10yrs old and is mainly used for \"cold storage\" and an i3 NUC as my mini-server / media centre, again that's nearing 10 yrs. I've had both from new and they have been brilliant but the media centre is starting to play up and I'm thinking it about time I start thinking about changing both into one combined machine with new drives. \n My needs are not that heavy but ideally I would like to go down the TrueNAS Scale route with a 4U, 4-8HDD hot swap, short server style setup but I'm really struggling to put a decent combination of HW together to match the value for money of the QNAP TS-473A which would also meet my needs. \n Further there is space, noise and consumption challenges with the server compares to the QNAP which further add to the cost to compensate. I don't know if the server style approach is more romantic than reality and if I should just bite the bullet with the QNAP and call it a day (despite my reservations on their poor poor security record). \n My best HW combination so far is as below to keep the NAS under £900 (excl HDDs/SSDs):\n Motherboard: Asrock X570 Pro 4 - £170\n CPU - Ryzen 5 Pro 5650G - £150\n Memory - 32GB ECC - £150\n Server Case - 4U - £190\n PSU - Crosair - 550W - £100\n Various Noctua Fans + Ancilliaries - £120 \n ​\n In comparison the QNAP comes in at £750 + £100 for a RAM upgrade to 32GB ECC. Granted the server is a little more powerful but has other complexities...\n What HW would you go with to justify the server over the QNAP?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/rediduser  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So this is kind of a generic question, but I'm seeking advice for best way to secure a VPS (recently picked up a pretty beefy VPS for cheap on cyber monday). \n So the issue I am running into is that when you install docker and deploy an image with the -p option, it's creating a related rule in nftables (running Debian 11). My original plan was to throw down ufw, forward only 80/443 and reverse proxy things I wanted publicly exposed (very little), and everything else would only accessible via wireguard. \n I setup wireguard, got that working and everything then deployed a syncthing docker (to backup certain files from an on-prem box). I didn't create a rule in ufw for the UI, yet I was able to browse to it and that's when I starting researching and learned that -p option was creating those nft rules. This is not what I want; I want the syncthing UI to only be available to my clients connected to this VPS with wireguard, but I'm not sure how to achieve this. \n Any suggestions? How are you running dockers on a VPS without exposing it all on the internet?\n    submitted by    /u/devianteng  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "​\n So I got my new to me S3500 switches. They came with a single 1050w power supply. \n That thing is LOUD! I mean, I run older R710s and that noise is ok. Some of you prefer dead silent and that's ok, but I personally don't mind a bit of background white noise. \n But these 1050s are on another level! My first thought was to fan mod it, but with the amount of heat coming out of that thing even with the switch idle makes me think it would overheat rather rapidly. The main fans in the switch slow down considerably after boot and they don't seem too bad. Of course, I can't really tell for sure with the PSU fan blasting away. \n So looking around it looks like Aruba specified both 600w and 1050w power supplies for this switch. I have also seen mention of 350w power supplies in a couple of posts. However they don't appear in the datasheet for the S3500 so my assumption is they don't have enough power output.\n So for those of you that have run S3500s, is the 600w PSU a lot quieter than the 1050?\n    submitted by    /u/Radius118  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I do not have a good way to edit YAML files from a centralized area, and track changes or have a changelog. \n I am very new to code, and code tracking, is there any container/service that I could use for this?

          "description": "There were a set of fairly cheap 1U GPU servers (the 1027GR line) on eBay a little while ago, one of which I picked up. I've been tearing my hair out for a few weeks trying to figure out exactly how to control the fans on these things; there's a lot of people out there with instructions on how to generically control fans on SMC servers with ipmitool and some people have details for X9 boards. In particular this STH article/discussion was very helpful indeed.\n ​\n I do think it's worth reading that comment and the original reference guide so I won't go into detail here, but what I did want to add was that the 1027GR seems to have unusual ID's for its zones. Specifically everyone usually says that the CPU zone is 0x00 and any additional cooling zones are 0x01, 0x02, etc. but on this server, (or at least mine) the zones aren't that at all. The zones for controlling the fans on my 1027GR-TR are the following:\n  \n0x10: CPU Zone\n 0x12: Left GPU Zone\n 0x13: Right GPU Zone\n  \nI know it's not the most useful post but I just wanted this to be out there for the next person searching around. Save them a bit of time and maybe keep them from tossing the server they bought because they can't get it quiet enough to use.\n    submitted by    /u/That_One_Fellow_Nils  \n [link]   [comments]",

Install new devices from an image I created 2. Install software remotely 3. Remotely connecting to the devices when my \"users\" need help with anything that requires me to see their screen.\n I'm already pretty set on using AnyDesk for #3, but I haven't yet found a clean, easy (and free/inexpensive) solution for the first two points.

When I do this however, I can't access the switch or AP because I don't have an Ethernet port to route through the switch. It does broadcast an SSID but I have no clue what the password is. To get around this, I setup [Modem > Router > Switch > AP], setup a Unifi Console and got everything working. I then tried to remove the router with the now configured OS console, but when I do this it continues broadcasting the SSID I setup and the password is correct, but it won't let me connect back to the AP unless I have the router plugged in. It just says it's connected, obtaining IP, then disconnects like it was never even trying (Android).

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n unfortunately I have a strange problem on my Proxmox box (but probably it is not related to Proxmox itself). The system keeps adding a wrong IPv6 route. When I manually remove the route or reconnect the LAN-cable everything is fine for a few minutes. After that the wrong rule appears again and I have no clue what is adding the rule over and over again.\n The wrong route leads to no IPv6 connectivity across VLANs.\n The affected interface is eno1 which is connected to a switch access port that is associated to VLAN10. eno1 gets an IPv6 address as intended (\":d910:\"/\"cc10\" is my marker for: DHCPv6 in VLAN10):\n https://preview.redd.it/4n9v24jlsj3a1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95c42c7fa8f76989be23ff88e835c2a6129cdf9\n And here is the wrong route that keeps popping up. The prefix \":d920\" is only handed out in VLAN20. eno1 should never see this! Removing this route leads to working IPv6 connectivity, but the route keeps reappearing.\n https://preview.redd.it/ta0hl7ossj3a1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05e1b4c16e59552469d0f13fc13616204189c65\n I also checked with rdisc6 if eno1 does see any wrong router advertisments.

I’ve built computers in the past and have some technical knowledge, but nothing compared to this community. So, here’s what I’m looking to do:\n  \nNAS - I’m a video editor by trade, mostly 4K. I want a 100+ TB NAS to house archive files, and/or working files (if possible). I will hardwire my workstation to the NAS.\n PleX - I have a small-sized (<50) digital blu-ray collection and other digital movies in compressed formats that I’d like to house on my server and give access to close friends and family. <5 streams at once. Yes to hardware encoding.\n Experimentation - As this is my first introduction to all of this, I’d love to experiment with things like Radarr, Sonarr, home automation, Pi-hole, and I’m sure other things in the future.\n  \nThe hardware I've picked out can be found here or outlined below:\n ​\n  \n CPU Intel Core i5-11400 \n  \n Motherboard Gigabyte Z590 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA 1200 \n  Memory G.Skill Aegis 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-2666 \n  Power Supply Corsair RM550x (2021) 550W 80+ Gold \n  Tiered Cache Storage (2X) TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB M.2 \n  OS Drive Kingston NV2 500GB M.2 \n  Storage Drives Seagate IronWolf Pro 18TB 7200 RPM (or 20TB depending on prices at time of purchase) \n \n    submitted by    /u/Mike-Anto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Also they are really cheap right now compared to what they were a few months ago. \n Since I'm still new, and this is my first time ever doing anything like this, I wanted some advice before I purchased anything. Is it a good idea to go with the Tesla P4 or should I use something else? Is there anything in addition to the GPU that I would need to purchase?

Indeed, I had figured out how to make this whole thing work before things broke after a power outage and I had to do my workaround again.\n I have two UAP-AC-HD APs and one UAP-AC-Pro. The Pro has no issues - I connect it to the switch, tell it to turn POE on, and it's immediately detected as 802.3af. Obviously also works fine with an injector. However, both of the HDs - when the AP has been disconnected for a while (e.g. 5 hour power outage), when it's connected to the switch, it's detected as \"non-standard PD\". When I connect it to an 802.3at injector, it turns on fine.\n Here's the strange thing - if I have it on the injector for a little bit of time (~5 minutes or so) then immediately plug it into the switch directly, the switch senses it as 802.3at and feeds it power.\n Has anyone run into this before?

I need good bandwidth while not ruining myself and we all know this can go quite fast in networking and servers.\n On another sub a user told me that if I wanted to max out the SFP+ ports between my server and my computers I needed RDMA. I then found an RDMA daughter card for my r730xd server and Mellanox CX3 cards for my computers.\n I then asked myself, is my switch compliant with RDMA? Another user replied and said that a switch needs to be PFC (Priority Flow Control) so it can do RDMA. For my budget I'm currently looking at the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP which have 4x SFP+ ports and PoE and is L2+ which does everything I need. At least that's what I though before that unclear stuff about RDMA. I called TP-Link and they told me my question was too complicated and that someone would call me back tomorrow which they did. The man on the phone was really lost and couldn't answer my question and said I would receive an email. I never received an email and it's been dead silent since then.\n TLDR; Can someone tell me if the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP can do RDMA over 10GB/s between my server and my computers all on SFP+ ports?\n Sorry to ask for a noob question in this sub but I need help and really have to take a decision on the network daughter card before they ship my server.\n    submitted by    /u/igmyeongui  \n [link]   [comments]",

Keep using my little i7 unraid box for VMs & docker (plex). I'd do 3 or 4 HDDS to start in Z1. I can add another array in the future? I'm a TrueNAS noob.\n Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Unraid for everything. No ECC RAM though with the i7... Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. Only concern is will I have issues with bitrot on Unraid vs. ZFS or Synology SHR.\n Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Proxmox and setup TrueNAS as a VM and run my Win & Linux VMs to proxmox. Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. \n Buy a 5-bay DS1522+ use 4x14TB HDDs, 1x14TB HDD as a hotswap. Add their overpriced 10gbe card. Keep using it as my file shares, use Hyperbackup to other offsite DS220 and cloud backup to GDrive. Keep my mini i7 Unraid box. Sell my DS918+ to recoup some of the expense of new one.\n  \nI do like how easy Synology makes things (love Hyperbackup). I use their quickconnect feature and OpenVPN to access it remotely. For accessing my Unraid remotely I use Tailscale. If I used TrueNAS, what do they offer for easy offsite backups and syncing to google drive?\n ​\n I have a short depth server rack so I can't use any full size servers. An ATX tower I would set on the floor. It's all in a 5x5 closet, no ventilation. So I do have to consider heat. Currently the Synology HDDs run 37-40C.\n ​\n Any feedback appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/wildmn  \n [link]   [comments]",

Perhaps a sticky/reference list of all the more common SFP+ modules, their release date, compatability with things like ESXi, general performance expecations, costs, ect.\n In my particular case, I've got a new R450 that I'll be using with Hyper-V on a slightly older T440 Hyper-V host. I'd like to setup replication between them and the backups we are creating could also use some wider bandwidth than 1gb NICs (no LAG, avoiding it). The new R450 came with a Broadcom dual SFP+. I'd be using 1 SFP+ via a DAC back to our UniFi Pro switch and I was thinking of creating a direct connection between the two hosts with SFP+ and a DAC cable. Making this purely for replication of our multiple VMs and virtual workstations, preventing this traffic from even having to touch our switches.\n The Intel x520-DA2 all seem long in the tooth and picky about modules, and the newer x710 even more so. Is there another solid option for dual SFP+ modules that play nice with Dell Servers (T440)?\n    submitted by    /u/Pr0t0c01s  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's got:\n 2x E5-2630v2, 128GB DDR3, 8x 3.5\", Perc H310 Mini, and an idrac express.\n So, overkill for home use, but hey, why not right!?\n ​\n So first I'm going ot make sure I'm all up do date with the firmware and things. Anything else I should do before getting started (like upgrading to a certain level of firmware and not all the way?)\n ​\n After that is done, on to installing more hardware. So far I've got 2x 8TB Ironwolfs and 6x 2TB Dell Enterprise drives to go in the front. Was thinking I'd make one raidz2 of the 6x 2TB drives for the data storage and home backups (and use something like backblaze or google archive for offsite backup of this) and then for the two 8TB, just leave as two disks for media use for plex (don't mind if i lose media, can always redownload (1GB connection FTW!)).\n ​\n As for the OS and LXCs and VMs, since all the front bay drives will be full, I'm thinking I'll order in 2x Samsung 980 250GB and 2x PCIe nvme adapter cards. Hopefully I can use the clover bootloader method to boot off of a internal USB stick that points to the mirrored nvme cards(?)\n ​\n From there I'm thinking I'll use proxmox as my base OS and have a bunch of LXC and VMs. Currently looking to hadware pass the drives to TrueNAS and have that be the main arbiter of disk space. Any ideas if this is a good way to go? \n ​\n I'll also be installing your usual home media things: Plex, Sonarr, Jackett, Deluge, etc.\n ​\n Along with some things like pihole, are there any other great bits of kit I should be looking at installing? Will look at getting a server nVidia GFX card for transcoding/mining/stable diffusion etc. Any ones I should look for/stay away from?\n    submitted by    /u/Fienx  \n [link]   [comments]",

My M630 has a QLogic converged NIC with BCM57810 which according to this document has \"Offloaded full HBA functionality iSCSI initiator\".

I have configured the card in BIOS, and sometimes I can see the card connect to the target, sometimes it doesn't. Anytime it tries it says the connection succeeded though.

I need minimum 8 3.5\" HDD bays for my NAS, though 12 would be ideal. As for the other equipment, I plan to use an unmanaged network switch and a UPS with a maximum depth of about 16 inches.\n When I look around for rack-mount PC cases or chassis, most of them are at least 27 inches deep, which would extend the overall footprint of the rack by quite a bit. I am aiming for low power consumption and don't need a ton of VMs, so I am considering a microATX motherboard or similar small footprint. I see a handful of shallow-depth chassis or cases out there but none of them seem have enough HDD bays.\n My question is: Are there any shallow depth rack cases/chassis out there with at least 8 HDD bays?

          "description": "Hi there. I have had 2 different lab setups I did in the past at home. However I have never really done anything involving switches... it was always tinkering with and connecting up DD-WRT flashed routers and really old computers I had acquired when I was doing computer repair. We have an issue at the small office of 7 employees that I was hoping I could receive some help on. This may not be appropriate to ask here, but /r/networking seemed like it was more of a place for enterprise level stuff, and this subreddit seems to be a place for home networking. My problem falls kinda in between. \n At my new job we have a bit of a mess in terms of a \"network\"... Lots of ethernet cables ran all over the building to offices that aren't used anymore. We have 2 people using USB Wifi Dongles to connect wireless to the router and the rest of the computers are hardwired between two switches. We also have an old server that is not being utilized. Folks that are hardwired to the switches can't Samba share to anyone not hooked up to the same switch. \n I have a network cable tester and tracer coming in the mail Thursday. I figure that is probably step 1 in trying to find out what is going on since nothing is labeled anywhere. What I'm hoping to achieve is to do minimal wire runs and configuration to allow for all of us in the office to be able to communicate via Samba and set up a way for automatic backups to be done on the old server that is not in use.\n It seems to me that connecting the switches together through a simple configuration might would solve these problems. A very basic overview of networking basics seems like where I need to start. I'm hoping to not have to dive too deep and eat up too much time. If anyone has a good link or resource for me, it would be greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/CountryFriedAlive  \n [link]   [comments]",

Since it came later, I never bothered with moving my system onto the Chembro, so the chassis is only being used for disks, and a different chassis hosts the system, which is connected to the disks via an external SAS cable. \n Things have been working alright, but now I want to expand. I've been eying a Supermicro SC847 chassis with capacity for 36 disks. I'll likely replace the 24-disk chassis with this one. I could also look into moving the system onto this same chassis, but I'm concerned about heat. If I were to keep the disks separate, is a chassis like the 847 the best solution? Are there any \"disk only\" chassis out there that would allow me to connect my system to this array?

Digging into my spare parts box, I managed to find four 1 TB HDDs (two internal drives and two old externals that are not in use) as well as a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB). \n I was thinking of somehow connecting these together and have the Pi control them. Three of the drives would host media/documents and the fourth would work as a backup of just the most critical files. Should I set these in some sort of RAID array? \n In terms of hardware, I've seen some four-bay HDD enclosures/docks such as these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2WRB97\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L7PSWV9\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUSU8MI\n Would this be sufficient for my needs and do I need to purchase anything else? Alternatively I have an old tower with a water-damaged motherboard that I could chuck everything into if that's a better option.\n My other questions were with regards to the OS. I'm really only looking to set up Jellyfin and Vaultwarden via Docker. Is it worth considering a NAS distro such as OMV or TrueNAS? Or should I just go with Raspbian and create a SMB share? It's only me using this and I don't plan to configure anything fancy so I'm leaning towards the latter...\n Appreciate any feedback and advice, thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AltruisticLoss1078  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I'm kind of curious what you all use at home, and what you use to manage it. So far, been through:\n - ESX (Welcome to a new version! You know all that hardware you carefully curated to work with me? as of this release I now support none of it! Enjoy the upgrade!)\n - Hyper-V Server (You can create virtual machines after you domain join me. Oh...you have no domain? Ok, I can still work, once you set up constrained delegation....and the default client config doesn't work without modifications...and I no longer support the out-of-box cypher suites without several config settings...you sure you don't have a domain?)\n - ProxMox (Wanna buy a license? Wanna buy a license? How about a license? Hey, sexy mama...wanna buy a ProxMox license?)\n - OpenStack (Have you got 14 extra server chassis lying around? Good. Let's begin)\n - and KVM (Welcome to the command line! The default setup does almost but not quite what you, personally want. Enjoy these twenty copy/pasted blog posts and have fun with these command line tools with 400 different settings!)\n That was all fun for awhile, but I'm wanting to use my home lab and not just rebuild it endlessly (and yes, I wanted to rebuild it endlessly....that was part of the fun).

So I have a couple of questions regarding this:\n  \nThe case, I see a lot of server cases but they all have lots of HDD slots and are kind of overkill from what I can see, maybe I should be looking for a 2U or 3U for a PC case. I would like to make sure I can fit whatever available GPU I have and maybe some things like NIC cards or other pcie devices and don't want to end up restricted. I'd be inserting a regular ATX motherboard.\n \nWill this work? I want to have some kind of small type c device on my desk that will deal with monitors mouse etc connecting back to the server rack (same room not too far) and maybe even type c powered monitors for a very minimal cabling job.\n \n I keep getting caught in a googling loop with type c docking stations when I look for devices that essentially just give me all the ports I'd need over type c so maybe someone has a better idea of what these are called.\n    submitted by    /u/reddddddddddditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has the external 68 pin connector which goes to the external drive, as well as another 68 pin inside along with a 50 pin scsi connector.

My internet comes in trough the router I got from my ISP, to which I have connected a separate pfsense firewall and my server is connected to that. Ports 80 and 443 are forwarded on both my ISP router (to the address of the firewall) and the firewall (to the address of my server).\n ​\n I have bought a domain and directed the name to my public ip address using an A record. This works, because I can forward a port (for example 5555) and access it from outside using www.mydomain.com:5555. However, when I try to access just the domain through the NGINX reverse proxy, it doesn't work. When I try to connect to the reverse proxy from inside my network (by just accessing www.mydomain.com) I get sent to the login page of my router. My router doesn't use CGNAT (I think) because when I traceroute my public IP it only takes 1 hop:\n traceroute to my.public.ip (my.public.ip), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 my.public.ip (my.public.ip) 100.108 ms 100.062 ms 100.769 ms \n My nginx/sites-available/default file looks like this:\n server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; proxy_http_version 1.1; } } \n I have also added the host in my /etc/hosts file. I found that the second line was already there, where it connected 127.0.1.1 to the hostname of my server (I don't know if that is correct or I should remove it). the file is this:\n 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname my.public.ip www.mydomain.com \n The server I want to connect to my reverse proxy is a nodejs server running on address 127.0.0.1 with port 8000. I have allowed NGINX on my firewall:\n Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- Nginx Full ALLOW Anywhere Nginx Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) \n Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/sem-tex  \n [link]   [comments]",

I will transfer new content to the server, process it into proxies, and send it to the laptop. This will all be controlled by RDP from the laptop.

          "description": "Hi, I have a Linux box that runs 3 pairs of 4 TB disks, each pair set to RAID1 with the Linux software RAID (mdadm). I'd like to convert them to a single ZFS pool with 2 parity disks without losing the data in the process, to make it easy to upgrade in the future and to gain extra capacity (would jump from 11 TB to about 15).\n 1st question is about the conversion. I'm planning to degrade all three RAID1 arrays to a single disk and use the freed disks to initialize a RAIDz2. I would copy over the files from the first RAID1 array then add the remaining disk of that array to the ZFS pool. Then repeat for the other two arrays.\n Is this doable? It's not clear to me if ZFS will let me start a RAIDz2 with only 3 disks... If I have to start with RAIDz1 can I convert it to RAIDz2 later \"live\"?\n 2nd question is about ZFS portability. What I like about mdadm is that you can install any Linux distro and it will pick up the existing arrays right away, they aren't \"tied\" in any way to a specific driver or hardware. Is ZFS the same? If I create a pool on one distro and then switch to a completely different one (or dual-boot) will the other one pick up the ZFS pool without a hitch?\n TIA for any insight.\n    submitted by    /u/GolemancerVekk  \n [link]   [comments]",

These will be for Proxmox VMs and my truenas setup running a bunch of docker services. The question is... in 2022 (almost 2023), are these procs still worth buying and using for this type of workload, or should I look at spending a bit more on newer processors/motherboards? I found prices for the cpu @ $88 USD, and a supermicro board for $180.\n Thanks!\n ~Rick\n    submitted by    /u/RickoT  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.\n Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.\n How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.\n Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE?

I am looking to create a home media server that might be capable of some other things like ad blocking or running a VPN (I'm interested in exploring containerization later as well). With the equipment I have already where would I be best suited to look for instructions on how to go about accomplishing my goals and is there a better way of doing it? \n Equipment thus far:\n - RaspberryPi 4B with 2GB in a starter kit (with power supply)[I wanted to try to make a Pi cluster]. https://www.pishop.ca/product/raspberry-pi-4b-starter-kit/\n - refurbished Lenovo ThinkCentre M73 Tiny Desktop (Intel G3250T 2.8GHz,128GB SSD, 8GB, WIFI)\n - Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Plus Switch\n I also have 2 older (from 2009 & 2013) MacBook pros I have been slowly upgrading [batteries, memory, RAM where possible] in the hopes of using them to be my media servers but I am having issues sourcing some parts.\n I do have some experience with virtual machines (VM Ware) and Ubuntu/Linux) if that helps.\n Any information would be greatly appreciated, thanks again for reading.\n ​\n tl;dr: Point me (beginner) in the direction of information on how to build a home media server with the equipment I have or suggest some additional equipment. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/Samsquatcherous  \n [link]   [comments]",

However, because I'm running NC via Docker, I'm not quite sure what to do. \n I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'm still not sure what the process is when I get such errors.

It appears they were custom built from Canadian company for audio production.\n All of them are using iStarUSA D-300 3U rackmount chassis with C2D setup with some special audio capture and ASUS GeForce 8400 GS Fanless cards. I decided remove all existing hardware components in the servers because their motherboard and PSU are dead due to leaked capacitors. I gave away one of them to my friend.\n Then, I installed two servers chassis with old and. new hardwares I have:\n  \n Chinese X99 board with Xeon E5-2640 v3, 32GB DDR4 ECC REG, and 12TB (4x3TB SAS HDD) RAID setup. It is currently running Unraid.\n  Supermicro X79 dual socket board with two Xeon E5-2620 v2, 64GB DRR3 ECC REG, and 500GB SSD SATA. It is currently running Proxmox.\n  \nNow, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?\n P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.\n P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports.

Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. \n I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. \n The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. \n My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. \n After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. \n I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. \n Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?\n Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. \n If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. \n My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Zeb_ra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Yes I like to have several iSCSI targets for virtual machines so I can move them around whenever the underlying server needs to get updated. That Mikrotik switch has been a great 10Gb switch for the price.\n I run a whole bunch of services on there, from basic storage, to active directory, exchange, the usual sonarr, radarr, prowlarr stack, paperless, netboot.xyz, some homebrew websites like a lego set inventory and investment tracker, openhab, docker, plex, gameyfin etc....\n It's located where our old heating fuel tank used to be. I pretty happy with the state of my lab for the moment tho I really need to take time (I don't have) to do some real nice cable management.\n The next major project is going to be to redo the room itself with a raised floor, drywall on all wall and ceiling etc. cause it's really just barebone and ugleh!\n https://preview.redd.it/9a89x9tlc41a1.jpg?width=3008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ba76a6ecede211887baae0201b2177f19176e49\n    submitted by    /u/h311m4n000  \n [link]   [comments]",

She is the one that typically handles it so I am a little in the dark about things.\n I have a very vague idea of what would be needed for a home server, but I could be way off the mark. \n With Christmas coming up I wanted to get her something to mess with when it comes to having her own home server for just our friend group. We spoke lightly on the subject of just getting a home server. The interest is there, the knowledge is lacking, so having kind of a cheap starter setup seems like a decent enough way to go. \n As for games, we would most likely have mod Minecraft, V Rising, Farming simulator, terraria, ect.\n We would typically have less than 10 people at any time, and the interests of the group swaps almost monthly in a rotation of games. So probably wouldn't need to be running multiple servers at once, but just have the ability to switch between them. \n Thanks in advance for helping a well intentioned oblivious husband.\n    submitted by    /u/Kitrollo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.\n I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.\n What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.\n MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/\n Many thanks in advance.\n TL;DR Exchange Server for Absolute Bargain Bin Level Idiots Guides Plz\n    submitted by    /u/SirWobbyTheFirst  \n [link]   [comments]",

The two CPU's I've been looking at are the 12700k and the 12700t. My thought process was to buy the 12700t but the performance seems to be on par with an i5. I then thought to buy the 12700k and undervolt it to be as power efficient as the 12700t. Which route should I take and can the 12700k be as power efficient on idle as the 12700t?

Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible.

Am I jsut not applying enough force, or have I chosen fundamentally incompatible connectors? \n Any hints welcome!\n    submitted by    /u/realityczek  \n [link]   [comments]",

After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.\n Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!\n  \nThe server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?\n The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?\n The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/_xulion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 2gbe through Google Fiber and the switches to support the throughput, but if I cluster these old laptops together and one of them doesn't have a NIC capable of that speed, then the whole cluster is going to suffer from a bottleneck across all resources right? \n I guess I don't understand how to determine the bandwidth necessary for resource access in a cluster and if there is a determinable max throughput or if it's just \"the more the better.\" \n My question summarized though is: Will I bottleneck ESXi cluster performance if one of the nodes has a NIC that is significantly slower than the others?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Hollowpoint357  \n [link]   [comments]",

Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.\n The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)\n Sorry, lights out\n    submitted by    /u/Knurpel  \n [link]   [comments]",

I requested an update only to receive a delayed response 1 week later that it could take up to 10 days to process the order (This was already day 10). \n Fast forward to when the drives arrive; packaging seemed ok. I tested them one by one and discovered 1/6 was DOA, the 5/6 booted but when I tried to take a SMART, it simply wouldn't perform the TEST. It wasn't that there was an error per se, it simply wouldn't perform the test. \n Weary of putting any data on the 5/6 drives even if they recognize. I email their support regarding the issue looking for a resolution. No real response for a week until they sent an email that it was forwarded to their 'IT\" department; however what was weird was the ticket was 'closed'. \n I emailed again to reopen the ticket 3-4 days later but no response. I emailed again another 3-4 days later with the same result. They are simply ignoring the support ticket even though there is a DOA Warranty for 30 days. I'm well paste the 30days and had to pay UPS customs/duties of $185. \n BUYER BEWARE: I heard good things about these guys from the serverbuild forums years ago and thought I would give them a try. I am sorely mistaken with their overall lack of honesty.\n    submitted by    /u/fartyrhino  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct?

I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.\n Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense\n Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.\n Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Khormid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.\n Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)\n This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.\n For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.\n After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?\n And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.\n    submitted by    /u/xRoguestatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)\n I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:\n 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)\n 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives\n I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process\n Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently?

          "description": "Hello everybody,\n I've been a lurker here for quite some time, and now that I'm starting to earn some money it's time to get myself a homelab.\n I've already experimented with an HP DL380 G7, but the power consumption was just too much to run it 24/7 (I'm in France so electricity isn't cheap).\n I'd like to build a server with consumer hardware: classic ATX motherboard, Core/Ryzen CPU so I'm not stuck with a motherboard which pulls 50W alone and other hardware which isn't made to be efficient at idle.\n My problem is that I'd like to build this in a rack form factor, ideally a 2U chassis with at least a dozen 2.5\" SAS/SATA bays (I plan to use SATA SSDs because of the lower power consumption compared to HDDs). I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).\n I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?\n So there are two possibilities:\n  \nmy 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;\n I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^\n  \nI hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either. Please don't hesitate to ask questions about my requirements, I may have missed some points!\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Cornichon622  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am trying to learn and hopeing to get better understadning of networking.\n ​\n It seems like I need to create VLAN for both side of pfSense and UDM SE to make it talk since there is no such a thing as bridge mode in between.\n ​\n What am I doing wrong?\n ​\n Is there any cabling I need to improve?\n ​\n How do I turn off DHCP on UDM SE and let pfsense take full control of it?\n ​\n I am assuming that all the unifi device need to be re-adapted to network when it has internet?\n ​\n Please help, I know it's hot mass but any help much appreciated.\n ​\n Cheers,\n ​\n JWK\n https://preview.redd.it/mua04cac2zz91.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9b184bf0ccd8efe5c7982a48871222b8f6487a3\n    submitted by    /u/RORO10GBPS  \n [link]   [comments]",

Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.\n CPU: AMD 5600X\n Desired setup:\n  \n2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0\n 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.\n 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot\n 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.\n  \nDrive quantity:\n  \n8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.\n 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.\n 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.\n  \nSo the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.\n I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.\n Thanks a lot for any guidance!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.\n I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.\n I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?\n Is it also worth looking into other file systems?

          "description": "Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.\n So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .\n But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :\n https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms\n Or you could go back to X86.\n Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.\n You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.\n Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for \"pfsense router\".\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/841ft3v2ckz91.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac555579191683e56468092b6d1fefd7c4fea74\n This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. \n What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.\n    submitted by    /u/EspurrStare  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all.\n I've been attempting to build myself a homelab, with a proper server, alongside my TL-SG108E, Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) and Pi Zero v1.3.\n I recently came across this server on Facebook Marketplace (for 200 EUR):\n  \nHP ProLiant DL360p Gen 8 \n 2x Xeon E5-2630 (6c/12t per CPU) @ 2.3 GHz\n 64 GB ECC RAM\n Quad 1 GB NIC\n Raid Controller (changed to HBA) - 120 GB SSD + 2x 300 GB 10K SAS\n \n  \nI had a friend tell me that they wouldn't get this stating that its a Gen 8 the processor, the specs, and RAM are low. But the issue is I am on a budget for a server (so I can create projects, AD environment, etc. (for testing, as I work in security)). I am wondering if the server is worth the price for a beginner/first server. I plan to run Proxmox and spin up pfSense and other stuff that might help with network segmentation, etc.\n Additionally, the seller offered to install a clean version of Windows Server 2016 and give me remote RDP access and ILO access to check the specs out. I plan on using Hard Disk Sentinel to get an idea about the disks' state and health, but what else should I do to make sure the server is solid (without defects, etc.) before purchase?\n I'd sincerely appreciate any help.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Arszilla  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has yet to be addressed.\n Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.\n In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:\n  \nThe UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.\n The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.\n  \nI'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.\n Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.\n    submitted by    /u/curlybrian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.\n Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.\n My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):\n https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US\n I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.\n Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?\n    submitted by    /u/Vchat20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey guys, just a question about UPS and if I’m on the wrong path. I have about 12 power supplies connected to two power outlets. My problem is that my breaker always flips if for example the power for our apartment goes out for some seconds. If I try to flip it back, I need to hold it down for 1-3 seconds otherwise it flips directly again. The power consumption is low, for all power supplies and the server it is about 120 Watt.\n If I would connect a UPS (Eaton USV Ellipse ECO 800 USB DIN for example) to my small homelab server and the power supplies the breaker problem should be solved or will the breaker of the PSU then blow if the PSU goes offline (power outage longer than battery)?

For my third copy, after researching cloud providers (cost, speed, and reliability), I've come to the conclusion that it's best to set up another NAS/server that I will plug in at a friend's place.\n I have two things I would like feedback on:\n  \nEncryption: what do you recommend to encrypt my data off-site? Assuming the server is always connected to the internet when on, is there a way to make it so that when the computer starts up, the encrypted data is not accessible, where I get an email or notification to do somehow remotely unlock the data? What I'm trying to guard against is someone taking the server and accessing my private data. Assuming it gets stolen, I'd like to know that the data is encrypted and not accessible.\n \nSyncing: given this data size (12TB now, 20TB in 5 years), is it best to keep the data in sync using Syncthing? Or would the size cause issues for Syncthing? If so, I would just have a daily Cron job to rsync the data.\n \n Welcome any insights you all are willing to share.

I’m fairly new to DAS.\n I was wondering if anyone else has experience similar issues with their Terramaster D5-300 DAS and shucked WD 20TB WD2000EDGZ drives.\n I’m not using this in RAID, just default single disk mode. \n I recently bought both and have began the install process and powering it on. I’ve noticed the 2x 20TB causes the lights to turn solid orange and repeated beeping. (All drives have been formatted already for Mac OS Extended Journaled ahead of installation.) This happens in any slot I put either 20TB drives in and both when they’re both in. I’ve pulled the drives out and connected the 20TB drives using a USB to SATA cable and they are recognized and works fine.\n However, my 2x 14TB WD140EDGZ drives and 1x 10TB WD100EMAZ can be placed in any slot and are recognized and works as intended. When all 5 drives are in, only the 20TBs exhibit the orange light and beeping from the DAS.\n There isn’t much documentation about this online or on their forums and thought to ask the community if they had similar experiences as I wait for a response from their support.

          "description": "Hello all! I’m a professional photographer who makes 8-12TB a year of data. My previous system catastrophically failed on me last month, so I’m back to the drawing boards. \n I’ve already ordered most of what I think I need, but looking for validation that this is a decent idea before I set it all up, fire up the single copy of my current archive data that still exists and start to copy that over to the new system. \n Primary location/archives: Synology 920+, 4x14TB drives, RAID5\n Studio location (offsite): Synology 720+, 2x14TB, RAID1\n Cloud: Google Drive Enterprise\n My plan is to split the main array into 3 folders @ ~14TB/ea. I plan to mirror these folders to the array offsite as a backup to my primary archives. When the offsite backup array gets full, the drives in it will be pulled, put into secure storage, replaced, then mirrored with the next folder. Hopefully that system makes sense? This would hopefully result in me only needing to fuss with this backup array once every 18months or so. \n My plan had initially been to use RAID5 for the on-site system, but upon further research, it seems like people really don’t like this setup? I was hoping to have several years of my most recent archives available locally so I can pull images for proposals, website, etc, and RAID5 would give me 42TB with this set-up. ~in theory~, since I’d have a physical backup of this data, I’d be able to arduously restore the data in the case of a dramatic failure/rebuild failure?\n I’m wondering now if I’d be better off doing RAID10 for my primary archives. I think 28TB would give sufficient access to files id need to access occasionally, and it seems people find this to be a more reliable and trustworthy set-up? \n Both RAID arrays would be for archiving only, and data would very rarely be altered once it was stored. \n Money spent on drives is also not really an issue. Just want reliable, and secure. \n What do you think?\n    submitted by    /u/charliesfinger  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently it's being managed with mdadm via the Cockpit project on CentOS 8 Stream. This has worked fine, but the machine that is handling my storage is also handling all of my other processing; Plex server, various VMs, game servers, etc.\n I've just purchased a new rack and plan to rackmount this machine in a Rosewill RSV-L4500U and grab a few used Dell Poweredge servers to use as ESXi hosts. In the process, I plan to add a few more drives to the array and I'd like to switch to an operating system that's more dedicated to managing storage. I've looked into TrueNAS and Unraid, but both seem to have a pretty major drawback that makes them less than ideal for me; TrueNAS appears to be exceptionally difficult to add drives to after the fact, which means I'd need to buy vastly more HDDs all at once, and Unraid suffers from poor read performance due to its single-spool nature, which isn't ideal for loading VMs off of. I still need to have this machine run the Plex server, as it'll be the only chassis that can fit the GPU for hardware transcoding. \n I might just be misunderstanding the use-cases and features of these operating systems, and if so, please do inform me! What I'm really looking for is a storage-focused OS that makes it simple to manage and monitor traditional RAID, but I'm finding that surprisingly difficult to find! \n Wondering if any of you have experience with any solutions that might fit my needs.\n    submitted by    /u/asphere8  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've read what feels like countless discussions on scanners and scanning processes to the point where it makes me slightly nauseous. I'm new to it. I'm buying a scanner in January and finally embarking on my long awaited scanning journey. I intend to digitze my collection of fashion magazines - and the most important aspect of them are the images, of course. It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. \n However, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don't know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don't want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there's a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture. I'm providing some images of my tear sheets. All help is greatly appreciated! \n Detail\n Double spread\n    submitted by    /u/cambynes  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been reading up on bit rot for the last few days and several threads have appeared in this sub-reddit that have given conflicting opinions on this topic. Am curious as to what the current consensus was?\n For reference I currently run a raspberry pi 3 with 2 HDDs attached, both ext4. 1 HDD is exposed via smb which all the family access and then a cron job runs once every 2 weeks to rsync to the other HDD. Another cron job then runs once a month to rclone the content to google-drive. Our data is relatively small ~ 300GB, the vast majority being photos + home videos.\n So yer is bit rot really something I need to be concerned about / pro-actively defend against? Or is it unlikely to ever really be an issue and not worth the hassle?\n    submitted by    /u/coolio9876  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything I’ve read on this sub says just to start simple and small and work your way up and to have another location for files. So I have some flash drives I’ve gained over the years some new some old, a brand new 2tb and a hand me down 1tb drive and a photo scanner and I want to do it right so I have a few questions. \n First: Storage. I found a leather zip up case on Amazon to put all the drives in. Are these recommended for storage or is there any way to go wrong with just flash drives and small hard drives? As far as another location goes, my family will all have copies of the photos when I am done and even as I start to save them I’ll keep some drives at my brother’s house. But do you guys recommend cloud saving, and if so what service? \n Second: File saving. I don’t know much about computer files and compression or anything like that. I also have some files coming from Mac devices and don’t know if it will be important for all files to be the same file type when all is said and done? Is this preferred, should i convert all my file types to a certain type like png or jpg or both? And should I keep these files compressed onto flash drives so you have to unzip them to view them or am I overthinking this portion? Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/grantdotyea  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've researched a whole bunch, but some of the posts are old so I wanted to know what the current status of the service is from the usual providers.\n How is Backblaze with upload/download speeds for their Personal backup plan? Is the restore process still limited by how you can restore the files, and how fast you can download them?\n Is the Backblase B2 better than the personal plan? Are there fewer restrictions/limits compared to the Personal plan? Does it allow you keep the files on the cloud even if you unplug the hard drive for many days? I think the Personal has a 30 day limit. How easy is the restore process? Does it allow you to select all files and do a backup?\n As for Crashplan, does it also have limitations for upload/download speed and how you can restore the backup? What about iDrive, icedrive, GDrive, DropBox, etc? I know I'm asking a lot but there is not much information on people's experiences with restoring the backups.\n I have about a minimum of 4TB of data I want to backup.

          "description": "I was copying files from one drive to the Seagate drive in question (so I don't care about getting the data from that - I just want it working so then I can copy to it again). My computer completely froze (I was doing another copy with 2 other drives at the same time - those ones are fine though, funnily enough) and had no choice but to restart it during the copy.\n The main source drive was fine (thank goodness!) but the Segate 5TB not so much. I don't think it's a mechanical failure (in the platter / read/write head sense) - it spins fine, no beeping or any unusual sounds. But when I plug it in, it disconnects after a few seconds. When opening disk management on windows, it shows \"Unknown Not initialized\" for a split second. Given the circumstances of the failure, faulty cables wouldn't be a thing - although I tried different ones anyway to be doubly sure. So clearly some hardware issue, but I doubt mechanical - so I opened up the ensure (without snapping the clips somehow, lol).\n I put the hard drive inside a spare enclosure. Plugged it in - it didn't disconnect, but it wasn't showing up normally. I go on disk management, and I can see again \"Unknown Not initialized\". Again, I don't care about getting data from this, so I right-clicked on \"initialize\". It says \"The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error.\" So definitely software will not work whatsoever. This leads me to believe I fried the control board / PCB, which provides an interface for the mechanical drive to communicate with the computer. Thus, I can't access the drive.\n The model of the PCB is 100721570 REV E.\n Am I correct in surmising that this is a PCB failure, and that I simply need to buy a replacement (AliExpress seems to be the only place I can buy this)? And apparently I need to copy the BIOS firmware from my original PCB to the replacement - is that true?\n Or is it really a mechanical failure?\n    submitted by    /u/craxing  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I finally installed the new Google Drive app. It's definitely an improvement over the old Backup and Sync, however there's one thing I am unclear on, and I can't find the answer anywhere.\n You have the option to mirror certain folders from your computer. All Google says is that it will keep files and folders the same in both places. What I interpret this to mean is, while syncing is happening, it will keep track of where changes are made and then make the same changes in the other place. If you add a file on your computer, it adds it to the cloud. If you delete a file in the cloud, it deletes it from your computer. It knows where the change is made, and makes the same change in the other place.\n But what if I turn off syncing for 2 months, then I delete 2 files from my computer's folder, then 3 months later I turn on syncing again. How is Google Drive going to know whether files have been deleted from my local storage or added to Drive? Is it going to add the files back to my local storage or is it going to delete them from Drive? What will it use as reference?\n In the old Backup and Sync, there were options where you could tell it what to do in these scenarios. I messed up once and after moving a whole bunch of files from a mirrored folder while it wasn't being synced, I then resubscribed to Drive and it re-added all of those files, and now that folder is a complete mess, 2 years later I still haven't fixed it. I wanna make sure this doesn't happen again, but in the new app there are no settings to set a behavior for when it discovers changes that were made while syncing was off.\n Thanks, any input is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/Qbccd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have around 5TB worth of data that I want to consolidate into one place and want to know how would I go around and do such a thing.\n Short backstory, I had a system with 2 drives, a 500GB SSD and 2TB HDD. Bought a 1TB HDD during start of the pandemic for recording location of recorded meetings. Year 1 into Pandemic, 2TB HDD has an error and on a \"Caution\" status from CrystalDiskInfo. I was also planning to build a new rig that year so I bought one 1TB NVME SSD(not part of the situation), a 2TB Ironwolf HDD and 4TB Barracuda.\n I didn't want to use my new drives on the PC so I used two 1TB External HDDs to store the data. Then a year later the 1TB I bought at the start of the pandemic was in \"Bad\" condition, so I gave in and plugged my 4TB HDD and transferred my files. For some reason I also plugged in the 2TB HDD. Now all of them are in use. \n So I did a disk analyze using WizTree and found out that I have half of my total storage full, not to mention earlier in the day I got an error that there was not enough space in my boot drive when I was saving stuff into there. \n Now how would I go around completely copying over these files into a whole separate drive/drives, eliminating duplicates and make sure everything is copied properly, so that I can completely wipe my current system and basically start from scratch.\n I would also like to ask on what kind of storage I should use to store this on. I think it will be just a cold storage, with the occasional rummage through, but it might also be another dump place I can continue adding to. I don't want to delete any of the files, more of its a hassle rather than sentimental stuff, but there are stuff that I definitely want to keep there. I would also say that I don't have much money to put towards storing these.

After Black Friday it is now back up to $119.99:\n https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Blue-Hard-Drive/dp/B09KMGQG5Y\n All other slots are populated with a mix of helium and non-helium 8TB drives, all MyBook and EasyStore shucks. I could not find any information on the Internet regarding whether this drive would honor the disable head parking command. It does.\n The warranty was advertised as 2 years. WD warranty checker lists the warranty as 3 years.\n This WD80EAZZ arrived with idle3-tools reporting head parking at 80 (8 seconds). This drive honors the idle3-tools command to disable head parking. I ran idle3-tools via direct sata connection from an Ubuntu 20.04 server.\n To do this from Ubuntu:\n sudo apt update\n sudo apt install idle3-tools\n sudo fdisk -l (to list what disk label your WD80EAZZ is set at)\n sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n (verify that drive respond to the idle3 command, and lists the parking time as 80)\n sudo idle3ctl -d /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n (you should get a \"head parking disabled\" message)\n Shutoff the computer. Fully poweroff the drive. Reboot and run\n sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace \"X\" with the correct drive label)\n ...to verify that the head parking disabled setting survived poweroff.\n This drive appears to be mechanically identical to the white label non-helium EasyStore/MyBook drives. But, it does arrive with head parking set to 80.\n This drive seems like a steal at this price. I had 2 4TB Reds fail within the warranty period. Due to the failed Reds, I gave up on Reds and started buying white label 8TB drives. I have had zero white label drives fail so far. I am sure one white will fail tomorrow.\n    submitted by    /u/CottonBambino  \n [link]   [comments]",

Unfortunately, there's no one who can maintain the system in my abscence & I dont have a concrete plan on how often I will be back in my home country.\n So, the question is, how much maintenance does a 6disk array Truenas system need with new drives?\n I realise this question is subjective as everyones 'milage may vary' and no guarantee our experiences would be the same.\n My estimates are:\n  \nconsumer nas drives last around 3 years from new\n sometimes more, sometimes less\n system would be running z2 so if a drive fails then Id shut down the system and consider my options.\n Ideally, if scrubbing has issues, SMART detects issues then I'd want to replace the 'bad' drive\n  \nQuestion1. Is it a bad idea to consider having data off-site without anyone to maintain it? Does more drives=more maintenance? \n Qu2: i.e I could 3 larger drives in Z1 or 6smaller drives in Z2, does one option (typically) require more involvement in replacing faulty drives on average? \n I would of course be able to access the drive via ssh/web interface to maintain the nas remotely.\n Qu3: Finally, in the case that one drive has bad sectors in truenas - is there an easy way to work out which drive has the fault? In the case I had to relay this to someone on site - how do we work out which bad drive out of the 6 is the bad one? \n Thanks for your advice.\n    submitted by    /u/Maximum-Warning-4186  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently in the process of disassembling my backup from DrivePool, but I need a plan for when I am done.\n Is there any way that I can format these backup disks in Windows such that they will play nicely in unraid, after I wipe my NAS array and rebuild in unraid, in order to move all the files from the backup to the unraid array? NTFS does not seem to be a great option.\n Edit: I realize now I should have mentioned this, but my main problem is that my backup is not a server, but a JBOD with SFF cables hanging out the back that I then plug into the soon-to-be unRAID server.

          "description": "This topic has been discussed many times, but i didn't find anything specific to my situation.\n I would like to create a RAID1 with 2 sata drives (same brand, model,capacity). My objective is to have this raid accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu, wich are located in 2 other separate drives. So i am not trying to boot from the raid, i am just using it for storing data. I know that the easy solution would be to go for a real raid controller card, but im trying to find out if it is really necessary to spend more money. As for the software raid option, for what i've understood you can't do such a thing and make it accessible from both linux and windows, but correct me if im wrong.\n So now i am thinking about doing it using the built-in motherboard controller, but every discussion i've read comes to the conclusion that you shouldn't do it because:\n 1 - If you change motherboard you won't be sure your next hardware is gonna read the data.\n 2 - motherboard implementations of raid usually use CPU resources.\n 3 - motherboard implementations usually dont have powerloss safety features, and this could mess up the data. \n My questions are:\n 1 - Are statements (1) and (3) true also if you have a RAID1 configuration? I am saying this beacuse since it is just a straight copy i would assume the way the data is written isn't that cryptic and i can read it easily if one of the 2 corrupts(or if i change motherboard).\n 2 - Do all motherboards do this \"fake\" raid? In my case on the manufacturer site explicitly says that it supports RAID 0, 1 and 10.\n 3 - Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to do? \n My motherboard : https://it.msi.com/Motherboard/B450-GAMING-PRO-CARBON-MAX-WIFI/Specification \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Cute_Rub_9074  \n [link]   [comments]",

As my data grew and I added larger HDDs to the system it seemed like a very cost efficient emergency plan. The original plan (with 2TB drives) was to back them up using a \"toaster\" drive. I'd keep a copy at work and a copy at the house and BackBlaze was the emergency plan. The \"Toaster\" backup went out the window in 2018 when it began to take hours using \"eSata\" as the drives surpassed 10TB.\n Six months ago it dawn on me (one of those Duh? moments) that I now have 33TB of data on the Backblaze cloud from my six 20TB drives. In the event of a catastrophic failure the only way Backblaze allows restoration is by downloading or a second option of selling you a USB drive that they will fill with your data. You can return up to 5 of these per year for credit.* In short, a complete restoration would take a significant amount of time in 8TB chunks, between mailings.\n I have now purchased a Synology DS1821+, which despite what it says does support Seagate Iron Wolf 20TB drives (I currently have it configured using six with SHR-2 redundancy and 1 hot spare.

It has external power connection, but I would need to change my current SFF-8087 to Sata cables for ones that uses SFF-8643. One great advantage are the external ports which will be useful in the future.\n So currently my plan is to buy that Adaptec Card to future-proof my setup.\n Is there anyone with experience with the Adaptec card (or the Intel one?). I plan to use it with a TrueNAS Scale VM on-top of Proxmox (with the HBA pass-thru).\n    submitted by    /u/webtroter  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Comcast WiFi sucks though so I have an ASUS mesh network plugged in to that for whole house devices.

I’ve got a 5ghz backhaul between the mesh network nodes and my home computer hardwired to one of the mesh nodes.\n Here’s the trouble… copying files between them I get like 30mbps. Using windows copy or Teracopy, doesn’t matter. \n Both computers Speedtest at 500mbps to the internet ( and between the computers using a program to test LAN speed at 600+mbps) so clearly the WiFi backhaul is plenty faster to my home pc. \n Any settings tweaks to speed up windows copies?

That idea intrigued me.\n Then someone chimed in that they still do this to this day for backups! Is this prevalent and a thing you are doing?\n I for one do a SHA512 crc of all the files and back up using 3-2-1 where ZFS 128bit, is the cornerstone of my approach. \n However I have not done any more steps to improve the likelihood of recovery success.

          "description": "Hey guys, \n I'm having a hard time finding a quality 6+ port USB hub to hook temporarily (4-5 months) six MyBooks (all 14TB) to a mini-PC on a Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 port. Typical usage would be copy/move stuff between the internal SSD drive to any one of the six MyBooks (one operation at a time). The important thing is the presence of individual on/off switches, so the drives would only run on demand (I need each one only 2-3 times a week and don't want them spinning up randomly or at boot/shutdown).\n The only semi-legit device I can find is this hub by StarTech, however, most people in the sub have a pretty bad opinion about that brand and the price seems a bit steep, to be honest. That being said, the last thing I want is for my data to become corrupted because of some alphabet soup brand's bad hardware... (speaking of which, any recommendations for a solid USB-B to Type-C data cable are much appreciated!)\n What I like about StarTech's device is the use of actual switches, and not buttons, which usually don't remember the last state after power-cycling...\n Thanks for reading and have a good one!\n    submitted by    /u/kraddock  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for \"visually lossless\", which should be easy as many scenes already look not the best. I'd have to apply lots sharpening filters and such to get a better look, something which I don't have experience with.\n Anyhow, using ffmpeg, how do you guys usually re-encode media for smaller sizes?

It seems that hard drives of that size and at capacities over 1tb are a rarity/mostly exist as external hard drives.

          "description": "I've been backing up my PC games from places like Steam, GOG, etc. on 100 GB Blu-ray discs. However, I have a lot of games to back up, and modern games can very easily go over 100 GB per game. I've been throwing around the idea of giving up optical media for my backups, and going with something like a 4TB SSD, especially today on Cyber Monday; putting games onto an SSD would be a lot faster than burning them to a Blu-ray disc, and obviously any SSD that I choose is going to hold more than a single Blu-ray disc, even a triple-layer one. If all I'm using the SSD for is long-term storage, can I expect reliability? I don't even plan on putting it into my PC, I would only plug it in externally whenever I want to add something to it for safekeeping, or if I want to restore/recover something later.\n Or, if I'm looking to save some money, how are mechanical HDDs for the long-term? I assume they're not as good as something with no moving parts.\n Thanks in advance for any insight, I really love the idea of long-term archiving, but I admit that I'm pretty new at this.\n    submitted by    /u/FireCrow1013  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I'm Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)\n I'm based in Europe and I've just setup a small cloud storage service.\n A short story about my initial thoughts on this project:\n I've been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I've noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).\n All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren't many affordable (mind you, $5-$7/TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.\n So I've decided to make a little project to \"fix\" this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?). I've had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.\n I'm basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.\n Requesting Feedback:\n I'm offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(\n You can check it out here.\n I'm already working on the next phase (the first one wasn't anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think it can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)\n Thank you for your time! \n Tom\n PS: I've got approval from the moderators to post this thread.\n PS2: I've made a similar post on Hacker News earlier today, just a small FYI.\n    submitted by    /u/ExtraLayer_eu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Back in February I picked up an OWC Mercury Elite Pro external enclosure for pretty cheap, as it was open-box. It's a dual drive enclosure with USB 3 and eSATA connections, fairly well built with an aluminum body and fan in the back, and - importantly - has a hardware RAID controller so it can run your 2 disks individually, in Span mode, or in RAID 0 or 1.\n Thanks to Black Friday, I nabbed 2 10TB WD Red Plus drives for a good price, and my intent is to stick them in the OWC, run them in RAID 1 for mirroring, and then connecting the enclosure to a Thin Client PC over USB 3, and then installing Debian to the Thin Client to run everything I need - Plex, backups, maybe some minor game server hosting and file serving.\n The OWC's RAID seems fully featured, if one of the mirrored drives dies, all you need to do is insert a new identical drive and it will automatically rebuild (I would obviously still back up the remaining good drive before initiating the rebuild), I'm just wondering if it sounds like a good idea. On one hand, USB 3 is a very fast standard, but on the other, it feels weird to be running a 10TB mirrored NAS over a single USB cable. Maybe it's a common setup, and I'm just new to this, but I was looking for some reassurance.\n    submitted by    /u/Shadow-Prophet  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I reduce the frequency to monthly to avoid 'wearing out' the drives, or is a weekly check needed to prevent bit rot on high capacity drives?\n EDIT: thanks for all the data points confirming monthly check is okay!

It was in my Unraid server and now refuses to power up at all, completely dead. \n I tried to use the return process on the Amazon site, but it doesn't work since its outside of the 30 day return window. Since the drive itself has a 2 year warranty, I contacted chat. They gave me a standard auto reply of \"You need to go back to the manufacturer for the warranty\" which is not how it works in Australia (in Australian consumer law, the retailer cannot refer you to the manufacturer or importer for warranty repairs). I replied with this information, and the chat officer offered to have someone higher up call me on my phone.\n I received the phone call, and the phone support was perfectly fine. I told them I needed to return a drive for warranty, but it was outside of the 30 days, but still has a 2 year warranty, and that I am in Australia, and purchased from Amazon Australia and needed to use them for the warranty. He accepted it straight away, and sent me a brand new 5TB Seagate Drive (he asked if I wanted a refund or replacement, but since I use it I went with replacement).\n All done and dusted, completely swapped under warranty! Not sure how it works in other countries, but in Australia the manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that shucking the drive caused the failure before they can reject a warranty, and retailer are required to work with the consumer to facilitate the warranty process (they cannot refer to manufacturer).\n If you are in Australia and need to refer to the specific detail around manufacturers warranties, just send them this: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-bought/repair-replace-refund-cancel\n    submitted by    /u/holastickboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow Denizens of r/DataHoarder\n I just bought 2x14tb WD drives, that I'm adding to my NAS, which is running OMV. It currently only has an 8tb drive in it, on EXT4, which is almost out of space.\n I've been looking into snapraid-btrfs and snapraid-btrfs-runner.\n This and Mergerfs seems to be the perfect combination for my use case of mainly media storage(and maybe a steam cache later) on mixed drive sizes.\n But this is my first time even having enough data/drives to even have to worry about parity/bitrot, so i want to make sure I do it right the first time.\n I have a few things I want to make sure I'm understanding properly.\n 1) So in Snapraid, a 'Sync' is basically creating/updating the parity data on the parity drive. Does updating a parity file go faster if little to nothing has changed on the data drives?\n 2) Snapraid 'Scrubs' periodically check the integrity of a file based off of the Parity data, and timestamp. Still don't exactly get how this one works\n 3) Snapraid Sync will fail if anything is writing to the drives. Snapraid-btrfs gets around this by having Snapraid take a snapshot of btrfs's Read Only snapshots. No idea if that's correct.\n 4) Using Mergerfs and btrfs on my 8tb + 14tb drives, I can fill each drive rather evenly, without striping files. I can use my second 14tb to store the parity file created by Snapraid-btrfs. This should be pretty protected against bitrot, and the rare drive failure, right?(other than files lost between a sync and a failure)\n Sorry this is so long winded. I appreciate any insight :)\n    submitted by    /u/SmolMaeveWolff  \n [link]   [comments]",

The same scenario I would like to use for the drive B to C, same as A to C. But the data on drive A are the most critical for me and I would like them to survive the trial of time with naively ideally no corruption and so on.\n I understand backups are vital in this, but one of the problems at this time is money, so unfortunately right now, something like NAS is out of question for me. (Note: The 102KRYZ. It was a gift from colleague of mine.) Second problem is, if bit rot happens, even with backups, I will have no idea about it and the backups would get overwritten through time, so ideally, the software for the mirroring should check for checksum, if I understand it correctly.\n Space in the PC is basically taken, so adding later another 500GB SSD would be a bit difficult. Thats why I would like to ask about this scenario and how I could utilize the setup I have to the best of capabilities in protecting my data. \n If this scenario is impossible, then maybe, is there a software for just plainly generating checksum and warning the user, if the files gets corrupted, so you could overwrite it from the backup from other drivers? Just a thought.\n I will be very thankful for any idea, answer or anything to my problem.

I'm thinking of adding a 2TB SSD for the \"everyday\" processes like the system itself, backups of local machines, torrents (seeding from SSD), Plex server, basically all applications running on the NAS and having all my media and data that I archive and stream on the array with my 16TB IronWolfs. This way that volume can sleep when I don't need it while the processes on the SSD run quietly in the background. I'd run mirrored backups of that single SSD once a day with another older drive or external USB for now.\n What do you think, does this make sense?

I'm not new to building PCs but don't consider it a hobby, just something I do in order to have a PC.\n I'm building for a new work rig (high end editing/creation), and putting 3x 6TB Ironwolf drives in there for storage of mostly photo and video files along with SSDs for files currently being worked on.\n I don't want to be playing around all day with the RAID setup, I just want something that works and will allow me to recover if one of the drives die. And yes I know that RAID is not backup! The important files are going in the cloud, also it's not critical data to start with (once the jobs are delivered).\n I'm really attracted to the idea of just using windows storage spaces in parity mode, especially now that I found this article and this one shamelessly ripped off the prior article with no credit but does conveniently have the numbers I'd need for my 3 disk setup to run with better speeds, because let's be honest it was NOT easy wrapping my head around the original article.\n Am I right that this is the right solution for a data noob like myself with my 3 disks? What else should I consider that doesn't involve becoming an expert? Things like TrueNas etc just seem like they're way above my paygrade, and I get conflicting information on hardware raid controller PCI cards (e.g. that it would be difficult to recover in case the card itself dies).

This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.\n Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. \n My main usage is:\n a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)\n b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)\n c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)\n d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.\n e) As my own personal \"Evernote\", with DS Note on android and windows.\n What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BarajasFernando  \n [link]   [comments]",

Fortunately, I manually backed up everything during the preparation just before the drive failed unexpectedly. \n Originally, my PC had two SSDs and one HDD all backing up onto an external USB HDD. I was using the Windows \"File History\" program at the time. \n While Windows File History was good at saving media files like photos, music, videos, documents, etc... I found that File History was a little finicky when I was trying to get it to back-up all the files on my PC. I tend to play a lot of games on my PC and I like to backup the game files so I don't lose my game progress. Each game tends to save its progress in its own special save-file, usually inside of the \"Program Files\" folder. Windows …",

          "description": "Autocorrect messed up my title. Thanks Autocorrect. \n So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.\n The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.\n Everything running on Plex.\n So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.\n Obviously I can (and have) \"optimized\"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?\n Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?\n Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.\n Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.\n Any pointers would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/slvneutrino  \n [link]   [comments]",

The name of the file is in Plex format \"%Title% (%Year%)\". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.\n My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas?

I've been meaning to make some upgrades to my desktop PC, and I'm currently struggling to find a very large internal drive, around 8-10 TB+, meant for standard/consumer desktops. Mostly everything I can find for a good deal right now is meant for NAS systems or enterprises, which have technologies that aren't recommended for a desktop, as compared to something like a Seagate Barracuda. Things like trade-off differences in speed and latency, error recovery, etc.\n I plan to store lots of large files, like lossless images and audio, movies, books, and maybe programs - all things I read and write regularly. My computer sees 15+ hours of use each day. I would also rather get one large drive than multiple smaller ones.\n One that I saw that seems like a great deal is the Toshiba X300 10TB CMR SATA 6 GB/s 7200 RPM 256 MB Cache - HDWR11AXZSTA for $189.99.\n Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.\n I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.\n I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.\n The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.\n Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!\n Whats next?

If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:\n yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sunshinesontv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nI'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?\n \nAlso, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.\n \nlastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?\n \n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/machineglow  \n [link]   [comments]",

The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. \n So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). \n Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. \n So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. \n What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time \n Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/HotEukaryoticMitosis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.\n A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.\n The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.\n Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.\n Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. \n And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.\n PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.\n    submitted by    /u/rbn_juicepop  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. \n Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. \n Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. \n Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. \n Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/rlsoundca  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My 4tb western digital hardrive was in a house fire. I don’t believe it was ever in direct flames. I found it with the plastic of the cover to the left of the USB port bent out and slightly broken but not melted i think a firefighter may of stepped on it. There is a very slight smell of soot but no visual smoke damage and the hard drive it’s self seems fine. No rattling sounds either. I think it is also very possible that it may of gotten wet from the hoses but this was about 3 months ago so dry now. If i plug it in to retrieve data am i risking damaging it? Should i give it to a specialist before attempting this?

          "description": "Hello fellow hoarders \n After buying the DS920+ from Synology last month to replace my good old 10 or 11-year-old Thecus N2200 with 2x 1 TB, the time has come to buy the drives.\n At the moment, I have inside the DS920+, 3x 2 TB units + 1 TB unit.\n My idea in buying the NAS, is to have an easy place where to put my family photos, back up from the phones to the NAS automatically (ditching google photos), use a surveillance station with 2x cameras and the extra space is for building a media library.\n I thought to buy 2 big units, shuck them, and put them inside the NAS in SHR RAID type; at the same time, put one 1 TB drive plus one 2 TB drive that came out of the NAS, inside the cases where the big drives came, connect them to RaspPIs with Rsync, one at my home other at brother-in-law, to automatically back up the family photos folder which I don't want to lose.\n ​\n After looking at disk prices .com I found the 2 best deals at Amazon DE are the 18 TB Western Digital Elements units at €16.06/TB (€289) and the second-best deal is the WD My Book 16 TB at €16.5/TB (€264). \n After reading around some older threads in the sub, I see some fellow hoarders point out the fact My Book has hardware encryption, making it not desirable to shuck and put it in the NAS. My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?\n My second question is, what drives are normally in?\n I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. \n In your opinion, is this achieveable?\n Are there any deals I should look into? \n What would you buy nowadays?\n    submitted by    /u/Oinq  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I'd like to set up a white box NAS that has some high-capacity HDDs with two mirrored 1TB or 2TB SSDs for additional fast storage. The goal with those is to keep the HDDs from spinning up every time the pool is accessed (for both a power and a noise perspective). I'd like for it to automatically shuffle data around periodically based on usage (i.e. most-used data stored on the SSDs).\n Is there anything that supports this? (Ideally with a nice GUI - nothing in Linux ever seems to \"just work\" from the command-line) I've messed around with TrueNAS in the past, but it doesn't seem like it can do any of what I'm mentioning (it cannot let the HDDs go to sleep (or something along those lines), cannot shuffle data around based on usage, and you can only use SSDs as a \"cache\" where the data is offloaded to the HDDs instead of having mirrored SSDs that actually store information).\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

The dollar/GB ratio is better and in case of a drive failure it's much cheaper to fix at $80-ish bucks a drive vs $220, but that is a lot more moving parts and probably over double the power in drives. I'm gonna be using it for ripping and hosting the family's DVD collection, my Blurays, PS2 games, and some important file backups. I'll be using a retired 4670k and 16gb of ram as the base for the system.\n Actually, thinking about it now would it just be easier to see how far 4TB RAID 1 takes me and just upgrade to RAID 5/6 (if you can do that) from there if it looks like I can use all of those drives? Honestly I didn't really think about that until now.\n Also, hardware or software RAID?

          "description": "So one of my clients at work has an iMac that is used as a Data Server. They are in the process of upgrading it to an actual Apple Server but it is a slow process due to cost. \n The problem is, they have 4 external hard drives that are used for backup purposes. Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.\n I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available. Open to any ideas, thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/AH_BareGarrett  \n [link]   [comments]",

Anyone else have similar fears and how did you resolve? I just worry the implosion of say 100tb of a pool would be riskier than losing a regular 14tb drive.

Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.\n I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.\n The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. \n What do you guys think about this current workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/FatherOfTheSevenSeas  \n [link]   [comments]",

It'll fit nicely with the Furman power conditioner and shelf.\n In case it helps, here's my current PC Part Picker list.\n My problems begin with the rack's depth only being 16.5\".\n That makes finding a rackmount chassis that fits difficult enough. So far the best one I've found (15\" deep, reasonable price) looks to be here:\n Sliger CX4150a\n I'd love to find some 6U or 8U unit so I could get loads of fans running at low speed to keep it quiet and a bunch of 5.25\" bays, but north of 4U appears to be either unicorns, or priced as unicorns. The two other variants of that linked one above (\"i\" and \"e\" suffixes) have one or two 5.25\" bays, but can't fit a deep power supply like that \"a\" variant.\n I don't intend to have dozens of drives hooked up daily or anything. I just want three to four 5.25\" bays available for 1) a Blu-Ray drive, 2) at least one 3.5\" hot-swap bay, and 3) at least one 2.5\" hot-swap bay.\n So I'm wondering if it's possible to have a separate case mounted directly above or below the linked one, and run the SATA and power cables to it (plus extra fans, I assume) for these drives?\n This subreddit just introduced me to \"JBOD\" (funniest acronym ever?), but even with that hint, most of what I'm finding is still into four figures. I'm literally just looking for a 1-2U piece with a handful of 5.25\" bays that wouldn't be too difficult to link into from the other piece.\n Anyone have ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Weirderal1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

We previously had some DROBO units but due to downsizing we got rid of the server they were attached to and the units basically bricked when we tried to update the firmware with the intent of moving and repopulating them. So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. \n I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? \n To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion.

Im thinking my numbers are probably way off. \n But well, the latest Seagate 2TB its having a premature death, so maybe this setup its a little hard on the HDD's.... or not?. \n Would it be better to setup an small 512 / 1TB SSD as a cache of the recordings*?, and then send each day to the HDD?. Not sure if a lot of writes are better handled with a Enterprise SSD, or a spinnning one. \n *For the unfamiliar, Unraid can use SSD's as cache, and a little script called \"Mover\" can send the data to the HDD at certain intervals, generally each night. \n Current Setup:\n 2TB Seagate, Single Pool Device, BTFRS partition. \n Requirements: * No need to have parity protection on this data. * Try to not kill the HDD / SSD too fast. * Able to handle future expansion, maybe 20 - 30 cameras in total\n In other subject... -- Are the CCTV HHD Drives any different?. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've read multiple articles on the issue but most deal with cost, which in my scenario is a non-issue because I'm already paying for OneDrive (professional reasons) and the family is on the icloud 2TB plan. I'm looking at about 100-300 GB of data. I have apple, windows and linux laptops, also proxmox servers. What I don't have, is a clear-cut solution to syncing OneDrive to iCloud Drive. Two-way sync would be nice, but it's not a must.\n My preferred Apple laptop for this application is an old retina MacBook Pro 2013 that doesn't run Monterey, but I'm willing to buy some SH Mac Mini for this situation. Currently the solution is more important than the cost TBH bceasue I'm looking for a set and forget scenario.\n I'm hoping others can describe solutions if in a similar situation. I was thinking of the following:\n Option 1: Setup a macOS system to do the syncing. Setup OneDrive and iCloud Drive to \"keep all files locally\" and then rsync between the two folders. \n Pros:\n  \nnative syncing of iDrive\n  \nCons:\n  \nmy macOS laptop for this \"application\" is a bit old (2013 rMBP) which is currently unsupported. I don't want to run unsupported OSes for security reasons and I don't want workarounds, especially when settings this up for the next few years;\n dedicated Apple Hardware to do the task, whereas Windows VMs might do the trick;\n Unable to check if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and healthy. When OneDrive might fail, it could desync, but worst case scenario I think it could completely wipeout \n  \nOption 2 Run a Windows VM, signed in to iCloud Drive and OneDrive, both setup to keep all files on device.\n Pros:\n  \ncheapest and most portable\n  \nIssues:\n  \nas above, unable to automcatically check and resolve if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and sync is healthy.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/blucafee80  \n [link]   [comments]",

Over the years my iPhone photos and videos have numbered 300,000 with a total of 1.8 terabytes of cloud space. \n I’d like to back these up physically but iCloud Photos on PC has severe limitations. I can’t physically download more than 999 photos at a time. \n Im currently trying to back up my iCloud to Photo folder to google drive then use google drive to download everything on my eternal hard drive directly. Will this work or have I started a path to futility? \n I’ve tried multiple phones calls with apple support and they are unable to advise on a clear path except for I need to get a Mac.\n I saw another thread somewhere where an individual had a python script to batch download photos. \n Just looking for the easiest solution. (I guess if I needed to buy a Mac to aid in downloading them all to a external hard drive and then return it) wouldn’t be the end of the world for me as long as that would work for a fact. \n All advice is welcome.

          "description": "My sister lost her husband during the height of the COVID pandemic. He had just built a new rig. I'm the family \"IT call center\" so she called and said it was time to organize things and asked if I could get everything off that she could still access from her laptop as needed, things that are on this PC are family paperwork, finances, wills, death certificate, etc.. Important stuff!!. She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.\n Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive. But is this the right way? She doesn't know where all his stuff was stored and doesn't want to miss anything I'm sure there's more than just in the \"documents\" folder. How can I ensure I get everything that may be on the rig worth saving?\n I've done some googling on backup software and sounds like I can achieve doing that. I guess I just want to be sure that it is the right approach?? And will I be able to give my sister a drive with a file dump? Is something like that achievable?\n Does backup software just grab entire OS? Or can I grab just every file? Sorry for the long winded post. Really not sure how to help her here and just give her an external drive where she can just access everything that may have been important on the PC. \n Thanks all!\n    submitted by    /u/Nodnarbian  \n [link]   [comments]",

It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.\n Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.\n So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).\n So, I could use some guidance on:\n 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?\n 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?\n 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?\n 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this? Once this thing is configured,I want to be able to do remote admin from my main workstation (win10).\n Teach me Sensei! Thanks 🙏\n    submitted by    /u/teejay818  \n [link]   [comments]",

Id like it to be as minimal work as possible. With money being the 2nd priority (but still a priority) \n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/converthis  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Would you guys recommend DISCTECH for buying some Factory Refurbished hard drives? They seem legit, but I'm on the fence. I really like that they (supposedly) don't open the factory seal and re-test the drives like ServerPartDeals does. If the manufacturer just recertified a drive, I don't want a seller opening it and re-testing ya know?\n Edit: I'm starting to think it's probably better to get a \"Manufacturer Recertified\" drive than a \"Factory Refurbished\". Refurbished likely means it was a repaired drive that was bad, when a Recertified should indicate a returned/open box drive. Does this logic sound right?\n Any opinions are appreciated cause I trust y'all.\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n Factory Refurbished from DiscTech:\n https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-Exos-X16-ST16000NM001G-16GB-512e-SATA-Hard-Disk-Drive\n This is what they said when I asked about them testing it:\n https://preview.redd.it/xrzy2draqzz91.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a480b31369765e87bb828bbae3de62a8db9c00\n Manufacturer Recertified from ServerPartDeals:\n https://serverpartdeals.com/products/seagate-exos-x16-st16000nm001g-16tb-7-2k-rpm-sata-6gb-s-512e-4kn-256mb-3-5-fastformat-manufacturer-recertified-hdd\n Update: DO NOT buy from DiscTech's eBay store if you want their 1 year seller warranty.

I was able to get a cheap Optiplex which seems to fit quite well for my use case. Problem I have now is, that I read, that the HBA cards are getting quite hot and in that Optiplex SFF won’t be to much space to provide proper cooling. At the beginning I was thinking of a new case (Nanoxia deep silence rev 6b to fit everything in one case), but with that Optiplex a case swap seems to be quite hard. Building the whole thing new from scratch would cost way more then use that Optiplex. Now I thought of getting a random tower put that HDDs in there connect them to a power supply and then link them to an LSI HBA 9200-16e which I would then plug into the Optiplex. Is the card going to be to hit then? Should I just leave the case of the Optiplex open and this will do the job? Or will it be better to just plug in USB Drives into the Optiplex?\n If building an external enclosure all I really need is that HBA card (it mode), a case, a usual power supply and the SAS to SATA cables, right? \n Any other solution or ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/locopivo  \n [link]   [comments]",

But asking around, experienced friends mentioned two things, 1) LSI card IT mode is a thing, therefore SATA port count does not matter too much, 2) apparently supermicro and decommissioned server boards exist (average pulled-not-refurbed offerings were on the higher end of my budget; not going to get any of the beefy ones).\n I start to hesitate whether to get an average desktop board and grab a LSI, or find a previously owned sm board. Searching in the subreddit, it seems both have been done, but I didn't see opinions of choosing between the two, although points have been made about whether it's good to get second hand motherboards. \n I am comfortable with using HPC servers and have done some VPS self hosting for fun, but this is my first time to build and maintain a physical server.

My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. \n As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini.

Is there a tool that can do this?\n As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_CINN4M0N_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for something in the 4-6TB range and willing to spend maybe 200 (ideally less though). \n any help is much appreciated thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/Patkinwings  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have two HPE LTO8 drives in an HPE MSL2024 library.\n Sometimes when I mount them, they mount as \\\\\\\\.\\\\TAPE0 and \\\\\\\\.\\\\TAPE1 and sometimes they mount as \\\\\\\\.\\\\TAPE1 and \\\\\\\\.\\\\TAPE2. \n They're both on Fiber Channel, on SCSI 5/0.0.0 and 6/0.0.0. I thought it's supposed to be that the lower SCSI ID should be TAPE0 (or the lower path), but that doesn't happen either. Either 5/0.0.0 or 6/0.0.0 can mount as TAPE0, TAPE1 or TAPE2.\n I can see no pattern to why they mount one way or the other. \n The issue is, if there are two tapes in there, I don't know which drive has which tape. So I have to spin up a tape and then go look on StoreEver Command View to see which drive goes active, and I can't reliably automate anything.\n Is there any way to predict or control this?\n The controller is a QLogic QLE2562-CK 8GB Dual Port Fiber Channel, running on an EPYC 7262.

I know it's a problem with the enclosure because the drive works fine as an internal drive running off a normal computer SATA power cable. Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.\n Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures?

          "description": "The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. \n Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).\n So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBirdOfFire  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have other Ubuntu server 20.04 and 22.04 VMs which I’m trying to connect to my samba share. I can get it to mount my fstab entry manually using sudo mount -a but ONLY after pinging the client from the server. I can’t get it to auto mount on boot. ststemctl status mnt-media.mount gives errors: mount: /mnt/media: special device //192.168.1.28/delorean does not exist I’ve been through a massive amount of troubleshooting just to get to this point. Some of which includes completely removing and reinstalling samba on all the machines. I can connect to this share from a windows client without any issues. \n Please let me know what other information may be useful. I don’t see any information in the samba logs.\n    submitted by    /u/lukeh182  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyLegend1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).\n Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.\n Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5\" bays and is less than 19\" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.\n ​\n Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?\n This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082\n This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/\n This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179\n    submitted by    /u/icelandismine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.\n This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.\n I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow.

Create a \"wedding pictures\" folder and move all these pics over there.... etc*\"\n Is all that possible?\n \\One thing that I am not clear on... let's say I go to a folder full of pics on the NAS and start editing them on an iPAD (or whatever device, PC, MAC, etc). Am I using whatever photo viewing / editing SW to view and edit the file residing on the NAS (i.e. the SW is acting like a \"window\" to look at the file still residing on another computer).... or am I pulling the file ONTO the device, making changes, and then when I hit \"save\" it overwrites (uploads) the new file to the NAS?*\n I am not sure there is a fundamental difference in outcome but just wondering.\n    submitted by    /u/_How_Can_She_Slap_  \n [link]   [comments]",

There is no other backup of the data (I know, shame me) and the drives are old and some are smr so another failure during resilver is possible.\n Now the data is a mix of music, movies and photos. The photos account for around 1 TB, music a few hundred gigs and movies about 13TB. The photos are most important as I can't replace those of I lose them but the music and movies could be replaced tho it would be a pain.\n My thought is to copy the photos to another pool while this one is still degraded and then resilver the pool. If i lose a drive while copying it wasn't going to survive the resilver anyways and I get some of my data, if the copy completes and then a drive dies in resilver I save my photos which is what I care most about.\n Any flaws with this plan?

          "description": "My question is essentially the title and mostly comes from idle curiosity. Do they not make 2.5\" CMR drives anymore? I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.\n The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.\n TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.\n Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...\n    submitted by    /u/KRS_88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. \n Is there a solution that can do all this?

Through the years I've migrated through the \"stack of floppies\", \"stack of 1/4\" tapes\", \"stack of CDs\" and \"stack of DVDs\". Is there anything that should stay current for the next decade? What (w/ proper storage) should last until it's time to migrate to the next \"Latest & Greatest\"? \n It kinda seems that there is no longevity/cost-to-start/cost-to-maintain sweet-spot. M-Discs seem good longevity-wise, but they're expensive/TB and their individual capacity is a bit on the low side. Duplicate HDs are good on the cost/TB side, but how long would they last sitting in a firesafe once filled? LTO is great on the capacity and cost/TB, but start-up costs are very high and living through the floppy & 1/4\" tape era, I'm leery about the longevity of tape in storage. \n How reliable are refurbished LTO drives?

          "description": "This is a \"problem\" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.\n The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.\n One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on \"disk1\" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.\n To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.\n Some info about my system:\n  \nOS: Arch Linux\n Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1\n Asus Prime H510M-K\n Intel i3-10100\n 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)\n Disks directly connected to the motherboard\n  \nI experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.\n I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.\n I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.\n    submitted by    /u/bepsifif  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello r/DataHoarder\n Quite often have seen in comments that people suggest to move to HBA expansion cards for users who run bunch of HDDs, as this is more safe and provides more slots for those who run 8 or even more drives. By HBA, mean SAS HBA devices.\n My question would be - Why such devices are preferred in comparison to plugging many HDDs to SATA ports? \n At the moment I have 6 drives connected, these already populate entire motherboard's available SATA ports. Also have an PCI Express SATA Controller Expansion Card (1 x PCIe X1 to 4 SATA), but currently there is no need in more slots. While on other hand probably I would like to expand drive pool later. Heard such cards are not recommended, because often cheaply built and can affect speeds as all drives will share single interface.\n    submitted by    /u/q1525882  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm planning on adding 2 drives to my linux server in a LVM Raid 0 configuration, it should match my existing raid5 in capacity (22tb usable). old raid 5 will become the backup volume, so no concern for data loss. LVM raid will allow me a on-the-fly conversion from raid 0 to 5 once I add a third disk. The server is used for many things, but 4k streaming via plex is the only real resource consuming thing (although we have only 1 stream at a time).\n WD Red Plus 12TB (256MB Cache) for €298,90 or €24,908/TB\n WD Red Plus 14TB (512MB Cache) for €373,98 or €26,713/TB\n Originally I had decided to get the WD Red Plus 12TB, but then I noticed that the 14TB has double the cache size. I'm not sure how strongly that would impact the performance and if it will be worth the extra 150€?
