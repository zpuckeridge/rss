I see a lot of people on here mentioning that they do indeed have some kind of Synology DS, but never mention any of the apps provided by Synology.\n For the following intention, do you even boot DSM (and what do you do next to, e.g., install and then run photoprism/lychee/librephoto or nextcloud or jellyfin)?\n What I'd like to set up, is 1. a file server to share with my family and maybe a few friends, 2. a photo server where my family members can all upload their images and then share specific albums or pictures with specific outside people, restricting unintended people from access, 3. syncing our contact lists, so I don't need to register contacts my wife has already added, 4. aggregating all the digital music from my family members, 5. shared task management and \"project\" organizing, 6. co-journaling 7. a postgresql db (that should be higher up there...) 8.9.10.11. etc.\n I am looking into port forwarding to make all of this accessible from the outside, but I've already found out this isn't trivial at all. I'll get there, I'm confident.\n Where do I start? Install software like nextcloud and docker through DSM and continue from there or do you circumvent DSM completely and ... ? Well, what, actually? or do you use any of the Synology software, and if yes, what are your experiences?\n I am not a programmer, but know how to RTFM and I am pretty patient and happy to learn.\n    submitted by    /u/MolecularMacMansion  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I can, let's say, have now 3 machines but in the future add some more and manage their containers from some UI or something.\n Thanks in advance.\n EDIT: After seeing lots of comments and wrapping my head around Portainer, Kubernetes even Podman, I think for now I'm going to go with Portainer because:\n 1- It seems simpler, since it's just Docker and I've been using that for the past months\n 2- Kubernetes seems more suitable when you need to manage a cluster and big stuff, add like HA to your services, and overall, too complex for my use case. However, I really liked the idea, and I'll definitely try it out for fun when I have some time\n 3- Also I've seen that regarding memory usage, Kubernetes tend to hog more than plain Docker, and that's a concern for me since I plan on using Raspberrys for now (or at least until I have enough money to get a decent home server)\n Thanks again to all of you that commented, I have still a lot to learn!\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeRabid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just because this version works on PHP7.4 you are still encouraged to use PHP8 instead though\n Updated all the composer and npm dependencies (the latter of which are generally only used in dev)\n Lots of bugs fixed, including one that has been around for 3 years, where cookies would expire and the user would be left with an error 500. Turns out this was an issue when people were running multi-user, it's now finally fixed!\n Some basic keyboard navigation has been added.\n MySQL and PostgreSQL are both now officially supported in addition to SQLite.\n Stop polling when the API returns an error.\n Added a bunch of translations, some of the strings had to be google translated as some were missing though.\n A bunch of fixes have been applied to apps, such as the password field should work properly now.\n There is also a background job that updates old config files if newer ones have been released.\n Private apps and app development has been fixed\n There are instructions for running without external access to the app, however things like automatically downloading icons wont work in that case. This is also experimental, so let us know if we can improve this.\n Doing a tile search will now open the first item in the search results instead of returning an error.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/ls_kode  \n [link]   [comments]",

For some context, I have a huge library of artworks and content of different artists online (some might call that Linux ISOs). I have everything on my server, but I need a tool to easily view these from a browser.\n Those few photo management solutions that support existing directory structure, all have some kind of downside.\n - Nextcloud photos can't actually use the correct alphanumerical sorting and goes from \"1 (1).png\" to \"1 (10).png\" instead of \"1 (2).png\". The issue for that seems to be stale or just forgotten because it's open for like 3 years -.-\n - PhotoView has some problems with displaying large directories, as it makes giant database queries every time you switch a directory\n - Lychee is quite nice, but its import process is just too slow. With a library of around 300k images and videos, it takes for ever to import that once, but every consecutive one takes forever as well…\n - PiGallery2 is the only one that seems to be fast enough with what experience I want, but still some of the tasks in the background for indexing or general preview generation also takes a long time.\n ​\n Just to clarify, I don't need syncing to my phone or whatever other features solutions like Immich has. I just need something to quickly browse a giant library of photos and videos.\n Are there any solutions I haven't come across, that could help me in this case?\n    submitted by    /u/TheSeventhCode  \n [link]   [comments]",

Everything still works using the external FQDN and I also changed the URL in the env variables in Portainer.\n Trying it from an Android mobile (on the same network) using Opera/Chrome/Kiwi and the frontend loads but says it cannot connect to the backend. By default I still had the local LAN IP configured in the env variables. Changed this to the docker network address and also the external FQDN (after forwarding ports) and they all worked on desktop still but none of them worked on mobile. Changed the address on the error page the frontend loaded and also changed the env options in Portainer.\n I'm not sure what to look at now. As I said at the top, the frontend and backend are talking as it works on the desktop.\n    submitted by    /u/9100  \n [link]   [comments]",

One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.\n The new Appwrite Console in v1.1\n Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.\n To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.\n In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:\n 🖥️ Dashboard\n 🔐 Authentication\n 💽 Databases\n 🪣 Storage\n ⚡ Functions\n 🧙 New Wizards\n ... and more!\n Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.\n We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI.

Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.\n For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.\n 40k photos in one view\n Progress update as of 11/22/2022\n tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.\n Some of the major new features:\n Live Photo Support\n  \nThanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.\n HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.\n  \nVideo Transcoding\n  \nMemories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.\n Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1\n  \nMultiple Timeline Folders\n  \nFor maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.\n You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)\n  \nServer side encryption\n  \nIf you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore\n  \nNew metadata sidebar\n  \nYou can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar\n  \nNew photo viewer\n  \nWith some fancy UX. Try it out ;)\n  \nThe full changelog can be found here.\n If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊\n    submitted by    /u/radialapps  \n [link]   [comments]",

The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.\n I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.\n Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.\n At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?\n    submitted by    /u/Chaos_Therum  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.\n Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.\n 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.\n  \nHuginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nautomatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted (for now).\n  \nn8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.\n  \nHosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.\n  \nBeehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).\n  \nHosting: Self-hosted.\n  \nPower Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.\n  \nHosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).\n ---\n I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.\n 👇 Links to these tools in the comments.\n    submitted by    /u/usamaejazch  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.\n I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).\n I have the following setup:\n  \nCloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.\n \nNginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.\n \nOpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.\n \n I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.\n Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.\n Thanks in advance.\n Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.\n    submitted by    /u/xViMeSx  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I also see some people be a little bit bummed out by the lack of devices on the free plan. Well fear not as tailscale has a plan which is made for open-source projects to use, and also for friend/family use. The Github Community Plan.\n This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. \n Step 1: Create a github account\n Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)\n Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.\n Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with \"Select Network\" as it should be under the \"Multi-user tailnet\" banner.\n Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the \"Github Community Plan\".\n Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. \n Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.\n    submitted by    /u/Stetsed  \n [link]   [comments]",

Currently I am leaning to option one because it would be simpler and continues with my business plan to expand into my own software, create mirrored servers for redundancy etc...\n Edit: I am also worried about potential liability concerns regarding data loss.

Just a tool that notifies me (e.g. using a WebHook, Telegram, ..) if a disk/mountpoint is almost full. It would be nice if it's possible to also get a notification if a systemd service fails or define custom shell commands but that's not as important. Prometheus and all these databases seem like overkill. It should be as lightweight as possible (RAM usage, disk usage, dependencies).\n If such a thing does not exist yet, let me know if you'd be interested. I might create such a tool if no one comes up with something.

I come across a lot of programs that I'd like to try out on a 2nd server so I don't mess anything up on my primary server. I don't want mass texts about plex being down. So I just spun up a 2nd server running proxmox and an ubuntu server vm. I installed docker, docker compose, and I'd like to kind of mirror my original unraid setup and get everything proxied through NPM, but I'm having a hard time getting it set up with the same domain. \n When I try to go through the cloudflare tunnel setup it says I already have mydomain.net with a DNS record. Is it possible to have 2 instances of NPM on 2 different machines using the same domain and cloudflare tunnels or do I need to get a 2nd domain?

I went into my router settings and did the port forwarding from ports 80-10000 for a test for both TCP/UDP mapped to the RPi, but when I check online using port checkers, it is still closed.

I currently have 3 VLANS setup:\n  \nManagement - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc\n Home - My personal devices\n Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services\n  \nMy firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).\n I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.\n This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.\n Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?\n ​\n Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN?

I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. \n First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as \"animal\" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. \n Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members \"user level\" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. \n I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.\n It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server. Obviously, that would have its own pitfalls, but it's just a thought.\n    submitted by    /u/rtuite81  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "first off.... the code + demo:\n Repository - includes a GIF demo \n What is AmbientWeather?\n AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.\n ​\n What does your tool do?\n Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. \n If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.\n ​\n Which weather stations are supported?\n Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.\n ​\n What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?\n What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.\n ​\n Anything else?\n So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups. If you give this tool a try and hit any issues, please be patient and feel free to open an Issue or post on the Discussion board.\n    submitted by    /u/philosowaffle  \n [link]   [comments]",

I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night trying to sort out an issue that should be simple. The person on the phone was obviously following their support script and I don't blame them for that, but how many times do we need to re-create the issue before you escalate it? I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say \"2SV\", is not well implemented in their system.\n For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. \n So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/ChillPill89  \n [link]   [comments]",

Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. \n I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. \n Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this?

          "description": "Hi,\n For a webapp of mine, Excel file/ODS/CSV import feature was requested, however instead of supporting a fix scheme(s), they wish to have bigger flexibility: some columns should be optional, sometimes the numbers, dates are formatted differently (because of the different locales) in those sheets, sometimes there could be a header row, or the values are starting at the 5th row, etc.\n I think these requirements are pretty general, they've certainly come up a lot, in a lot of software - personally I had to build it a couple of times, so I'm a bit borred now, and started thinking how to solve it generally. So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.\n Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.\n    submitted by    /u/Losoncziterimenekult  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm facing the issue that moving from one server to another (which shouldn't happen often, yet has to happen at some point), is a huge burden to even think about.\n So... the answer to this is... obviously, containerization, where we separate applications from data. Let's talk docker.\n However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.\n Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?\n Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.\n But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.\n How do you handle this issue? Do you have cron jobs that restart your containers every now and then and upgrade the images so that security fixes can come over?

It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.\n You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.\n Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.\n ​\n Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.\n    submitted by    /u/barinali  \n [link]   [comments]",

Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:\n Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.\n Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.\n I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.\n From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.\n Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.\n (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)\n    submitted by    /u/mfsb-vbx  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.\n It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.\n My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. \n Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line?

TLDR at the bottom\n Context: I was looking at setting up a couple services from scratch a few weeks ago and thought to myself, \"I wonder if I can just buy something with it already installed.\" So I've been looking into it and I personally have not been successful in finding any kind of seller that provides this (self hosting as a service?). I have played around the idea a bit in my head and I am of the belief that there may be a few that would be possible with this method of deployment. \n Those of you who have went through the pains of starting to self-host for the first time, or those of you that are just busy: Yes or no, please let me know! This survey is completely anonymous. https://forms.gle/bXZSfXjAzoa1FsyS9\n TLDR: I want to know if a \"pre-built\" device containing requested services is something you would ever consider purchasing over setting it up from scratch yourself.\n    submitted by    /u/lolipopsandtoejam  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know I could host these files on the Nginx server and have them served statically, but I'd rather keep them in one place and it's only a couple of files and only being served occasionally on my local network, so ease of config/development seems to me to be mroe important than performance.\n What am I missing?\n Also, I noticed that Caddy is an Nginx alternative - can it do forwarding to Tomcat?

There are great options for replacing the majority of what music services like Spotify or Apple Music do - Jellyfin, Plex, etc, supported by software like Lidarr and the like, to make it easy to self-host your music library, expand it, access it with ease from anywhere with a plethora of clients etc.\n The one thing that's missing, to my knowledge, is a discoverability/recommendation engine. Features like 'Daily Mix', dynamic playlists that encompass popular songs from a particular category, 'Discover Weekly' etc. These are IME very nice features for discovering new music and expanding your music library.\n Is there something out there that's usable with something like Jellyfin?

It's very gratifying to learn that others receive value from something you created, so thanks again to everyone who gave me feedback and use whalewall.\n Probably the most useful addition in this release is the addition of a Docker image, which should make deploying or trying out whalewall much easier.

          "description": "Apologies in advance if this kind of question is not allowed here 😊\n I am looking to create a file sharing service that works on a local network (that's not exposed to the internet) .\n The use case: I'm from a remote African village where internet is expensive and slow, and lots of people (when I'm there) ask for commonly used Apks (mostly WhatsApp, and other utility things like pdf readers) and also some other kinds of files. When I can I share these /download for them.\n I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.\n My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.\n Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.\n The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/true_heart  \n [link]   [comments]",

At the outset I knew that deliverability would be an issue but now, even with all appropriate records set up (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, PTR) and server configured correctly, messages are still go straight to spam (GMail).\n My mail server is hosted by DigitalOcean and I've learned that entire ranges of their IP addresses have been blacklisted. I've tried assigning different Reserved IPs to mail server but so far it's no help. One obvious option is to try moving the mail server to a different provider entirely, but I'm not sure which providers have good reputation AND are cost effective AND will allow sending. I'm open to suggestions on this.\n Another option I was considering is using a third-party for sending since the larger players tend to have excellent reputation. But I'm not sure if this can work for my service. With services like SendGrid and MailGun, domains and senders need to be validated. My service allows users to create multiple profiles (senders) — I alone have ~180 — so limits on such services would probably be reached very quickly. If sending from custom domains these services require adding DNS records, but this wouldn't be appropriate in my case as the records would have references to the third-party domains.\n What would be the best option to ensure email delivery?\n Any useful suggestions welcome.

I have learned a few things along the way with the help of guides, forums and reddit. \n Today I setup a reverse proxy so my friends could use Overseerr without exposing my IP address. It isn't that I didn't trust my friends, but mainly because my IP address changes so often from my IP that I didn't like getting messages that \"it's broken\". But I do know it is bad practice to let people know what your IP is.\n This is the first taste I have setting up a reverse proxy, though I setup Wireguard with Duck DNS to be able to access my server outside the network in the past.\n I believed I setup everything correctly in Nginx and applied the SSL certificate to the domain that was created for Overseerr. The only issue that I am running into is through Chrome I get an warning, \"Deceptive site ahead\". Edge and Firefox does not show this warning. After some googling people generally say that it is a Duck DNS problem, and after using no-ip to create a domain, it does appear that way as I get no warning when using the no-ip domain to access Overseerr. I don't want to use no-ip as you have to renew the domain every 30 days and I don't think I can set it up to automatically update my IP address when it changes (this could be a lack of knowledge). \n I was wondering if there is a way to fix this issue. Currently I have Overseerr, Duck DNS, and Nginx all as dockers inside my Unraid server. \n Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/knoll126  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep all my media / data on it, and run a few docker containers (Plex, radarr, sonarr). However, recently I have gotten myself worked up about data rot, and have decided I should really build a TrueNAS system with ZFS. \n My thought is to build a low powered TrueNAS system that is just used for storage. I am thinking 6 8TB drives in a RAIDZ2 config. Then run a higher powered Proxmox system for my dockers and a few VM's. \n Does this make the most sense? I know I can run docker with TrueNAS scale, but to be honest, I would rather just setup TrueNAS once and leave it alone. I know I can also run TrueNAS on a VM, but again, I don't think the idea of that.\n    submitted by    /u/jnash85  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all,\n I've recently tried to integrate authentik for my various services to help secure them behind some authentication, but I am running into some weird behavior (namely 500 and 502 errors).\n I have all containers tied to a custom network, docker_prod, so I am able to use container names in NPM rather than relying on changing port numbers. This works fine for just launching the apps from NPM, but seems to cause issues w/ Authentik.\n I followed this tutorial to setup Authentik and I was able to get it working the first time, but haven't had luck since. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I seem to flip flop between 500 and 502 errors.\n I've looked up and down for more documentation, or youtube tutorials, but it doesn't seem like other folks are running into this same issue.\n I also do not understand the terminology despite reading the instruction - provider? outpost?\n My need is (hopefully) simple - I'd like to add authentication in front of applications that do not have it natively built in. As a future step, I'll integrate 2FA via Google Auth.\n Can someone ELI5? Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/radakul  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd really like to get a Xeon with at least 12 threads but I think I'll either need to go rack mount or a standard tower (or build my own). The Macbook handles the heavier workloads (Frigate, Nextcloud, and a Mac VM).\n I'm kinda just basing my estimations on Passmark scores but I know that doesn't tell the full story.

After some research I found out that some other routers have the same option as well. Pfsense seemed like a decent idea too.

I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.\n I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say \"home.laxweasel\" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.\n I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.\n However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.\n Thoughts/experiences?

I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.\n This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.\n    submitted by    /u/qwacko  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.\n In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.\n Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).\n I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.\n TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise\n    submitted by    /u/DropkickFish  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was previously running Nginx in a Docker container before. The Nginx container, as well as the rest of my other containers, all shared a Docker network called common. Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.\n Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.\n However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).\n This is what I've tried so far:\n ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } \n }\n server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server \"the-container-name\"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } \n } ```\n The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?\n I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.\n I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.\n    submitted by    /u/detuneattune  \n [link]   [comments]",

I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. \n Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with.

Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.\n Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/squirrelhoodie  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n Basically the title. Recently changed broadband providers and this new router does not allow port forwarding of any kind. \n Being said, I'm looking for a VPN service to deploy while I don't install my own router. I have a few in mind like tailscale and cloudflare access, but would like your opinion or what your solution is.\n Some requirements:\n - No need for port forwarding\n - At least two different users\n - Must use pubkey authentication or MFA (hardware key support would be great)\n - Access to entire LAN (for example, if I connect to the VPN server, I need to be able to access my router)\n - Local DNS (when connected, the traffic would use a DNS server in my LAN)\n - Highly desirable to work with docker/k8s but not a deal-breaker\n ​\n In the past I had a wireguard container running rock-solid, but without port-forwarding I can't do this.\n What do you lot reckon?\n    submitted by    /u/Flicked_Up  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.\n Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.\n Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/funfungo0dg0od  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. \n But there are a few basic things missing, like:\n - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata\n - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like \"turn image 90 degrees\")\n - simple file and folder operations like \"copy\" or \"move\"\n Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! \n But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. \n PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.\n For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. \n Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.\n I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 \"trash can\" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).\n So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. \n A couple questions:\n What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?\n My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?\n I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).\n Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!\n Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.\n    submitted by    /u/docholoday  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.\n The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.\n So the procedure:\n  \nCreate a new folder in your APP / Server, for example \"Mobile Photos\".\n Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload\n Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and \"Configure\".\n Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option \"The original file will....\".\n Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)\n Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.\n Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.\n  \nProblems:\n  \nFor some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.\n I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a \"Photo Folder\", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.\n  \nSo hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).\n My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.\n What I have looked at and dismissed:\n  \nHomechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.\n Monica - This is for tracking personal connections.

We primarily use it for our kids but we are slowly building out our own library via EBay and dollar bins. \n My thoughts were with the insane improvements to CPUs with the new generations that I should upgrade (first major upgrade ever). So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. \n So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). \n So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries.

I'm considering swag, but I have a cloudflare wildcard certificate being generated that I think may be an issue to port over to their framework.\n Side note, I'm grateful for the nginx-proxy-manager project and do not fault the developers or contributors if they don't have time to work on it or have other items they wish to focus on.

Metlo is a self hosted, open source API security platform that inventories, tests and protects your API endpoints.\n - We inventory your endpoints by scanning API traffic and detecting all your endpoints along with the sensitive data they contain\n - We generate information your security team may find useful like Open API Specs and risk scores for each endpoint\n - After this we discover vulnerabilities like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data or missing HSTS headers\n - Finally Metlo detects any anomalous behavior on sensitive endpoints in real time so you can detect 0-day attacks as they're happening\n We have a sandbox for you to play around with here http://demo.metlo.com/. Also, Here's a demo video if you would like a quick walk through of the product :)\n https://www.loom.com/share/349c9e5f267741e9a0fcd2dfd1f9956f\n We’d really appreciate your feedback and ideas, and are happy to answer any questions!\n EDIT: We - me and my cofounder.

          "description": "Hi :)\n I'm starting freelancing as an engineer, and I work for a few clients wich gave me an internal addresse on their servers. As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.\n I could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.\n I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...\n Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...\n I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:\n - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?\n - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.\n I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.\n Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?\n ​\n Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/Biidouille  \n [link]   [comments]",

We're about 500-1000 members at the moment. I've warned them that if we move we'll have to pay for a server, but the majority are willing to chip in $1 a month.\n I have been looking into Mastodon, Misskey and Pleroma as alternatives, but I am unsure which one to go for.\n For those who know these pieces of software, I'm wondering about the following:\n 1: How easy to install and maintain? I have basic experience of Docker, but not much more.\n 2: I would be running this in a VPS, what would be the system requirements for these running 500 users and at running 1000 users? What sort of monthly costs should I expect?\n Not really self-hosting questions, but if anyone has answers:\n 3: These are people who have only used Twitter, which is the simplist to migrate to in terms of UI?\n 4: Many of their friends have already left for Mastodon. I read that Misskey and Pleroma can still connect and read Mastodon, but how does this work? Surely some features won't work?

This means that you can create an unauthenticated mirror of a private registry and expose it to the Internet. Easily. Don't do that.\n \n Two storage back-ends\n  \nS3\n Local filesystem\n \n Small footprint; in my test system, the official registry uses approximately 130 MiB of memory to mirror docker.io; five replicas of oci-registry combined use approximately 60 MiB to mirror everything in example.yaml, plus one private registry. CPU is negligible for both.\n A helm chart\n  \nWhy?\n A few weeks back, I had a need to setup local mirrors of $dayjob's private registry.

I am also, unfortunately, at the intersection of \"worried about security\" and \"don't know enough to know what enough security is\". I really didn't like the fact that docker ignored my firewall rules and opened ports on the iptables, so I made a custom bridge network and didn't publish any ports. In this way, I had hoped to be able to solely publish ports 80 and 443, routing everything else through the custom docker network. This felt safer. The massive problem with this is that it works - kind of. I can generally get to a service, but not always. However, if I get to them, they will be intermittent at best. They drop a LOT of communications via time out. I tried netdata to see if the system was struggling - seems not at all. I took the services out of the bridge network and published the ports normally - everything works great. This makes me assume I did something wrong on the network.

They have been a great success thanks to all of you! I am hoping to keep to a Friday schedule.\n My latest is actually something I had to deal with this week in work. Backups!\n Today I'd like to release Duplicati\n https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/017-duplicati/\n I have been working Bitwarden and Vaultwarden but before I release that I need to write a Dummies Guide to Email as we have to deal with SMTP. A subject not so easy to cover.\n Along with that I have been making big changes to the website that eventually will be released to the masses (cleaning up my own questionable code). Check out the Infrastructure page where it's all run by Hugo. Yes you will be able self host and if internet goes down you could start a project.\n Plus I want to hear from you all. I want to know what you are hosting and what should be a dummies guide. I already have a long list but doesn't hurt hearing what you think someone starting should know. You can find that here.\n That's all from me, Happy Self Hosting!\n J\n    submitted by    /u/QuantumNow  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently use Chrome Remote Desktop to access my home PC from elsewhere, but it has issues with lag and I'd like to not have the middleman here if I can avoid it.\n Tried Rustdesk (the only one meeting my criteria on awesome-selfhosted), and hated it since the quality was absolute garbage, at least on their hosted offering, and I don't have any faith in the self-hosted offering after that. I'm considering Guacamole, but that's just a client to standard protocols like RDP/VNC so I'm not sure how well it works.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/saveencore  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I'm making some server management software, to replace cpanel and automate my home servers. It's free and open source. The concept is, it only takes a millisecond or two to generate config files on the fly, so why not do that. Any important information, such as domain names and user names are stored in a single json file. I wrote a tool in rust which takes this information and inserts it into config templates. A single command installs the software, then the whole thing is already working.\n The web control panel is an optional package, and each service is also a separate package, you only install what you need. I wrote an install script with a menu to make it easy. The install script will also have an autonomous mode which can install the required packages without any interaction, which makes it easy to use with docker.\n I'm still working on the web control panel and a bunch more services. Currently I have dns hosting with named/bind, web hosting with nginx, haproxy, php-fpm, and lets encrypt, and email hosting using postfix. Websites are hosted each with an independent user and nginx instance. All this is configured automatically as each service starts. I'm working on adding support for hosting minecraft servers, managing backups and zfs pools, and other services as needed.\n Aside from a few bugs I'm still working on, my own use of the software has been smooth sailing. Hoping to continue work on it and make something great. The source code is currently private, while I still have some security concerns, but can grant access on request. I have faith in open source. I named it configer.io\n    submitted by    /u/lorenzo1142  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everybody,\n I'm testing the solution in the title. My goal is having a simple to-do list app that saves data on a selfhosted service and allows the sharing of the lists. Using Radicale as a backend and Tasks.org as mobile app, everything works easily. I evaluate several solutions and this is the better one: Radicale is mature and updated, tasks.org connect to it without the need of DavX5 or other things. Very very good.\n Now, the problem is that the basic docker default config of Radicale does not have any kind of users management, in the login page you just insert a name (and no pwd, even if the field exists...) and if the username exists, you are enabled to see and manage (delete too) all its items; if it does not, a new user is created!\n As said I read some docs but I do not understand too much: I just need that users should have a password and that only users I authorize can login, so no automatic user creation. It seems I have to specify \"users list\" and \"users config file\" in the \"radicale config file\"; \"users config file\" details resources access for users.\n So, the question is: how have you solved this situation? Might you publish the config files you have? I just need 3-4 private calendars for family members and one shared.\n    submitted by    /u/wireless82  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I have recently been looking into hosting game servers publicly. While also not leaving myself open to any attacks.\n I have an AWS EC2 instance up and running and have Wireguard running between it and my local network. To be more specific I have my local machine connected to the VPS. The VPS has iptables to move UDP traffic on both 16261 and 16262.\n I have also configured Traefik to forward the data to the correct server. I cannot seem to establish a connection to the game server. I have tested with both a VPN on my client to make sure I am connecting from the outside internet and without the VPN. In the diagram I want data to flow in via the blue line through all the respective connections. Then the red line out and back to the client so they can play on the server.\n I also realize that this can pose some latency issues and an inability to ban by IP. I really could care less about that. I want to mitigate DDoS or any form of attack that isn't based on an exploit in the game. If the game has an exploit then that is a whole other issue I will worry about. This is about minimizing the attack surface not the optimal way.\n https://preview.redd.it/vzjww5julex91.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6467aca37b9b897ff7388df2189779cf3f0b69c\n    submitted by    /u/IcyBlackAgeis  \n [link]   [comments]",

With only 32GB of RAM I quite often find myself unable to use more than 12GB of my 32GB for apps/VMs. This is quite frustrating to say the least. \n With this in mind I wanted to explore what other options there are for this? I have seen many options that have just NAS in mind but without docker/LXC/apps or virtualization. \n I have briefly tried proxmox, but it seems confusing, and I don't see any easy solution for creating containers for running apps. It does seem like UnRAID might be a good choice, but it is closed source and is paid. Not an issue that it's paid, but I disagree with it being closed source.\n ​\n I was hoping to run a couple of VMs for using Windows (Main rig is Linux only and there are some apps that are unfortunately Windows only), and a few game servers, in addition to running jellyfin, vaultwarden, qbittorrent, sftpgo, autobrr, photoprism and maybe a couple of other things should I find anything else interesting.\n ​\n Server has 32GB RAM, AMD 5 2600 CPU, no GPU, 5 8TB Ironwolf NAS drives. \n ​\n Thanks in advance!

Essentially, I have a group of friends and we meet regularly (online usually) to discuss a very wide variety of topics. Naturally, this leads to incomplete conversations about topics of interest that we'd like to come back to or address in the future and we're looking for an intuitive way that we could collaboratively do this. Ideally all of us to create/edit/add notes to any given topic so that we can pick it up later and then archive it when we're done. I've contemplated something like a shared todo list or kanban board, but I'm not really sure if either of those is the right fit (the first being too simple, the second being a bit too much).

Do you have any ideas for applications?\n ​\n We need:\n  \nan intranet for posting news and sharing messages (e.g. HumHub). External users should have read-only access to specific areas.\n a user database with own attributes per user and a simple user administration for technology beginners (e.g. Keycloak with a simpler user admin UI).\n email boxes that are easy to set up. An admin should simply say what name the mailbox should have and every allowed user (from the identity provider) should then have access via an email client. A ticket system is also welcome.\n a file storage (e.g. Nextcloud).\n a wiki.\n a registration form for events. The price may vary per pre-selection.\n  \n​\n The requirements are as follows:\n  \nwe have a little more than 1000 members. Each member should have their own account, which in the best case should already exist and must be provided with a password when logging in for the first time. We already have the e-mail addresses and other information in an Excel spreadsheet.\n security: if possible at least password policies and/or two-factor authentication. If the new passkeys feature is already supported, that would be even better. Also, users should be able to be logged out of all services immediately. It should also be possible for our chairperson (over 60) to assign roles to services.\n if an e-mail, name or any other attribute changes in the identity provider, this should also be changed on all other systems as soon as possible.\n  \n​\n I know C# and web development with PHP well, so I could also write smaller plugins myself. I get along reasonably well with Docker and Linux. The whole thing should run on a rented server.\n    submitted by    /u/HellOfBugs  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I am currently running a Plex media server on my raspberry pi, but it's quite clunky because my media is all sorts of different formats and I'm concerned that streaming high quality movies to my TV (firestick) is not going to work as seamlessly as it does when I simply play the movies from USB storage attached to the TV.\n I am thinking to FTP / SCP my media to the external storage attached to the TV. My question:\n  \nCan an Amazon FireStick access USB storage attached to the TV? I tried installing ES File Explorer (which supports FTP) but it only sees the FireStick's internal storage.\n \nMy Samsung TV is UE40H6400 and it seems I can not connect to the Samsung servers, I'm assuming because the TV is out of support. Does anyone know where I can find a list of .apk packages that are supported on this TV? If I can install (for example) ES File Explorer on the TV instead of on the FireStick, I'm assuming that the external storage attached to the TV will appear as accessible.\n \nIs there a better way to do this? I just want to avoid having to go through the whole process of connecting my external storage to my PC, moving media to it, disconnecting and reconnecting to TV, playing the media, disconnecting and reconnecting to PC... and so on each time I want to watch something not from a streaming service. I am happy to move stuff over the network ahead of time though.\n \n Thanks for any advice\n    submitted by    /u/richard248  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). \n Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The \"internal\" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). \n Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. \n My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. \n Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes.

It has an USB-HID connector on the back which is currently connected to my Synology DS216. I set up the UPS via DSM and it seems to be working fine. But now i'd like to connect also my Proxox server. As it seems i have the following options\n Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud\n I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.\n I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my \"server\".\n What do you think?

I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.\n I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.\n I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:\n  \nMedia Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.\n An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.\n If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.\n Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)\n  \nIt does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Kayfabe10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Digging into my spare parts box, I managed to find four 1 TB HDDs (two internal drives and two old externals that are not in use) as well as a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB). \n I was thinking of somehow connecting these together and have the Pi control them. Three of the drives would host media/documents and the fourth would work as a backup of just the most critical files. Should I set these in some sort of RAID array? \n In terms of hardware, I've seen some four-bay HDD enclosures/docks such as these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2WRB97\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L7PSWV9\n https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUSU8MI\n Would this be sufficient for my needs and do I need to purchase anything else? Alternatively I have an old tower with a water-damaged motherboard that I could chuck everything into if that's a better option.\n My other questions were with regards to the OS. I'm really only looking to set up Jellyfin and Vaultwarden via Docker. Is it worth considering a NAS distro such as OMV or TrueNAS? Or should I just go with Raspbian and create a SMB share? It's only me using this and I don't plan to configure anything fancy so I'm leaning towards the latter...\n Appreciate any feedback and advice, thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/AltruisticLoss1078  \n [link]   [comments]",

I understand the risks, so before I open anything up to the internet, I want to come up with a plan that will maximize security given the situation. Here's my plan so far:\n  \nHoneypot is on its own piece of hardware (RPi, NUC, not sure yet)\n Honeypot is in a DMZ (router has an option for this, but from what I've gathered, it'd basically just be a single-firewall DMZ)\n Vulnerable apps/services/etc. would each run in their own Docker container, which would have AppArmor profiles configured for them based on their capabilities\n Instead of running on the honeypot host directly, all Docker containers containing vulnerable things would run in an LXC container (or possibly a VM, not sure which would be better)\n VM/LXC container would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the Docker containers; host device would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the VM/LXC container\n  \nWhat do you think of my plan so far? I'm a complete novice, so please let me know what can be improved and what you'd do differently or add.\n ​\n View Poll\n    submitted by    /u/bookooBux  \n [link]   [comments]",

Pretty easily solved with Monoprice HDMI over IP encoder/decoders. Luckily I ran ethernet everywhere when we remodeled a few years ago. I can add additional decoders to other rooms.\n Problem 2: PlayStation consoles use Bluetooth for controller connectivity.

But I'm getting tired - been at this for almost 30 years - and am ready to hang up the hat, let the horse loose, and settle on the rocker....in other words, ready to stop tearing down and rebuilding the lab every few months with a new hypervisor. So, I'm kind of curious what you all use at home, and what you use to manage it. So far, been through:\n - ESX (Welcome to a new version! You know all that hardware you carefully curated to work with me? as of this release I now support none of it! Enjoy the upgrade!)\n - Hyper-V Server (You can create virtual machines after you domain join me. Oh...you have no domain? Ok, I can still work, once you set up constrained delegation....and the default client config doesn't work without modifications...and I no longer support the out-of-box cypher suites without several config settings...you sure you don't have a domain?)\n - ProxMox (Wanna buy a license? Wanna buy a license? How about a license? Hey, sexy mama...wanna buy a ProxMox license?)\n - OpenStack (Have you got 14 extra server chassis lying around? Good. Let's begin)\n - and KVM (Welcome to the command line! The default setup does almost but not quite what you, personally want. Enjoy these twenty copy/pasted blog posts and have fun with these command line tools with 400 different settings!)\n That was all fun for awhile, but I'm wanting to use my home lab and not just rebuild it endlessly (and yes, I wanted to rebuild it endlessly....that was part of the fun).

My name is Noah, and I am looking for an apprenticeship in Network Engineering, ideally in the East Midlands, U.K. This would be once I have finished Year 13 in June, so starting around August/September 2023. \n Interested in anything from ISPs, Large Enterprises, and MSPs. Indifferent to vendors as starting afresh - Juniper, Cisco, whatever! I own a little HomeLab, made up of Cisco Routers/Switches, and a WLC. I study L3 BTEC IT, L3 BTEC Business, Geography, and did an AS in Core Maths last year. Predicted grades are excellent. \n If you or your employer can offer me an apprenticeship, or if you have any contacts, I can happily provide my CV and Cover Letter - just send me a DM or email me at hello@nturneruk.com.

Well I decided to rebuild the labs software stack from the ground up, new DC, new OPNsense install, new everything really. As part of this I finally bit the bullet and bought a domain instead of using no-ip. \n So after buying the domain, wasting half a day realizing that Google Domains does not use Google Cloud DNS, converting my nameservers to Cloudflare, building a webserver, and configuring certbot I now have a wildcard cert for my domain. Yay!\n I manually imported the key into OPNsense, and hooray, the secure connection lock is there, I did it! Now what? I have all the *arr's to configure, my Windows domain environment, a bunch of ESXi hosts and vCenter, etc. Is there a way that I'm missing to manage and automate the updating of certs across all these services? Across any of the services? Is it really that once a certificate is issued its your job to apply it to any service you want to use it? \n I feel like I'm missing the whole management after issuing part... help me out here folks.\n    submitted by    /u/darkendvoid  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I have a couple of questions regarding this:\n  \nThe case, I see a lot of server cases but they all have lots of HDD slots and are kind of overkill from what I can see, maybe I should be looking for a 2U or 3U for a PC case. I would like to make sure I can fit whatever available GPU I have and maybe some things like NIC cards or other pcie devices and don't want to end up restricted. I'd be inserting a regular ATX motherboard.\n \nWill this work? I want to have some kind of small type c device on my desk that will deal with monitors mouse etc connecting back to the server rack (same room not too far) and maybe even type c powered monitors for a very minimal cabling job.\n \n I keep getting caught in a googling loop with type c docking stations when I look for devices that essentially just give me all the ports I'd need over type c so maybe someone has a better idea of what these are called.\n    submitted by    /u/reddddddddddditor  \n [link]   [comments]",

My internet comes in trough the router I got from my ISP, to which I have connected a separate pfsense firewall and my server is connected to that. Ports 80 and 443 are forwarded on both my ISP router (to the address of the firewall) and the firewall (to the address of my server).\n ​\n I have bought a domain and directed the name to my public ip address using an A record. This works, because I can forward a port (for example 5555) and access it from outside using www.mydomain.com:5555. However, when I try to access just the domain through the NGINX reverse proxy, it doesn't work. When I try to connect to the reverse proxy from inside my network (by just accessing www.mydomain.com) I get sent to the login page of my router. My router doesn't use CGNAT (I think) because when I traceroute my public IP it only takes 1 hop:\n traceroute to my.public.ip (my.public.ip), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 my.public.ip (my.public.ip) 100.108 ms 100.062 ms 100.769 ms \n My nginx/sites-available/default file looks like this:\n server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; proxy_http_version 1.1; } } \n I have also added the host in my /etc/hosts file. I found that the second line was already there, where it connected 127.0.1.1 to the hostname of my server (I don't know if that is correct or I should remove it). the file is this:\n 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname my.public.ip www.mydomain.com \n The server I want to connect to my reverse proxy is a nodejs server running on address 127.0.0.1 with port 8000. I have allowed NGINX on my firewall:\n Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- Nginx Full ALLOW Anywhere Nginx Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) \n Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this?\n    submitted by    /u/sem-tex  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi, I have a Linux box that runs 3 pairs of 4 TB disks, each pair set to RAID1 with the Linux software RAID (mdadm). I'd like to convert them to a single ZFS pool with 2 parity disks without losing the data in the process, to make it easy to upgrade in the future and to gain extra capacity (would jump from 11 TB to about 15).\n 1st question is about the conversion. I'm planning to degrade all three RAID1 arrays to a single disk and use the freed disks to initialize a RAIDz2. I would copy over the files from the first RAID1 array then add the remaining disk of that array to the ZFS pool. Then repeat for the other two arrays.\n Is this doable? It's not clear to me if ZFS will let me start a RAIDz2 with only 3 disks... If I have to start with RAIDz1 can I convert it to RAIDz2 later \"live\"?\n 2nd question is about ZFS portability. What I like about mdadm is that you can install any Linux distro and it will pick up the existing arrays right away, they aren't \"tied\" in any way to a specific driver or hardware. Is ZFS the same? If I create a pool on one distro and then switch to a completely different one (or dual-boot) will the other one pick up the ZFS pool without a hitch?\n TIA for any insight.\n    submitted by    /u/GolemancerVekk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I intend to use unRAID.\n It is the 8x2.5\" model, and I'm not happy with capacity or speed on 2.5 inch drives.\n I have done some research and want to make sure what I'm thinking will work and be beneficial. I'd like to get an expansion enclosure such as the Dell MD1200. \n The T610 currently has a 6i raid controller, so I know I need to upgrade it. Should I go with an H200 in IT mode or is there a better option?\n I guess I may be overcomplicating things, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm wanting to do things the best way possible with the T610. I also am sure I'll upgrade in the future. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/wsarge  \n [link]   [comments]",

Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.\n Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.\n How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.\n Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE?

Right now there is a 6 year old HP laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz and 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD. I only use this to run plex server with radarr, sonarr, qbt and Jackett.\n I want to expand with a rack-mounted server but I'm a bit overwhelmed with the options and price differences. I want something that can run ESXi with VMs for my plex media environment, as well as plenty of RAM and local storage options for NAS capability and practicing with virtual machines. \n Low power consumption and noise are nice-to-haves, but right now I just want something to muck about with in my homelab, but with some solid functionality over the network. My budget is up to $400AUD, and I don't mind it being DDR3 as it's more affordable. \n Can anyone point my in the right direction of brands/models/cpu configs I should be looking at for my needs?\n    submitted by    /u/BonoSlayer  \n [link]   [comments]",

In the past, I've installed software by hand, but this time wanted to focus on Docker.\n I followed the tutorial by highspeed_usaf and got SWAG and Cloudflare's tunnel working. I added NextCloud, Portainer, SearxNG, and Doku. Everything is working fine and SSL is working too even though, I'm not sure I really set it up (using SSL via CloudFlare).\n Anyway, NextCloud's security check is giving me a lot of warnings. Before, when I installed NC by hand, I was able to get rid of all the warnings and such. However, because I'm running NC via Docker, I'm not quite sure what to do. \n I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'm still not sure what the process is when I get such errors. Do I change files within the container itself? Or is there a better way to do this?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/damullens  \n [link]   [comments]",

It is currently running Proxmox.\n  \nNow, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?\n P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.\n P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports.

Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. \n I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. \n The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. \n My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. \n After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. \n I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. \n Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?\n Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. \n If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. \n My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Zeb_ra_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I've been self-hosting for a while, but for the first time, setting up an always-on server.\n Many previous posts on this sub have suggested Proxmox for a first server. However, based on my requirements, I was leaning towards Truenas Scale Bluefin. I need it to host some reliable storage for Postgres and fileshares, provision VMs to throw at my (external) K3s cluster for burstability, and lastly, host dev VMs for builds and VNC. I dont need vm snapshots, or hardware passthrough.\n The other thing is I also want to learn for career development, and TrueNAS familiarity seems to be a more useful skill since Proxmox isn't used in enterprise at all- looks even less likely as K8s seems to be the future of enterprise.\n Wondering with these requirements, does TrueNAS Scale over Proxmox make sense?\n    submitted by    /u/tamerlein3  \n [link]   [comments]",

The inside server temp are around 35-41C and I’m afraid that if that room goes any cooler condensation will occur and break part. So my question should I find other solution to heat up that room or move completely out of there (I was told if there a constant air flow this will not occur wonder what people opinion are on this) current plan is trying to warm up the room\n Edit: I have two sever and all my networking gear all in the same place as the dell sever stack one on top of the other with spacer in between and networking gear wall mounted\n Closed: I was not aware to the fact the the computer would need to be lower them temp room for condensation to occur\n    submitted by    /u/Odd-Acanthocephala54  \n [link]   [comments]",

But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.\n I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.\n What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.\n MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/\n Many thanks in advance.\n TL;DR Exchange Server for Absolute Bargain Bin Level Idiots Guides Plz\n    submitted by    /u/SirWobbyTheFirst  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So about 4 years ago, I was looking for a solution to get 2 ethernet ports back to my brother's room using an existing coax with the device being remotely powered. What I came up with was taking 2 DirecTV DECA adapters, I took an antronix power inserter and used it to deinsert power so I could split it to the two DECA devices, but I found out that there are no existing splitters on the market that power pass on more than one point simultaneously so I had to make my own DC splitter by taking an old crappy splitter prying the glued back off and cutting out the magnet wire and ferrites and soldered a piece of copper wire between all the ports. Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible. I only really ever used the device for testing, I never got around to installing it as I intended and then I went back to Comcast and the coax was no longer dead so it sat in a box until I found it today.\n https://preview.redd.it/by3i8md3zs0a1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=080a7005c5809341fb7828f27cbed12c6ec47815\n    submitted by    /u/blufeb95  \n [link]   [comments]",

After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.\n Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!\n  \nThe server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?\n The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?\n The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/_xulion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have 2gbe through Google Fiber and the switches to support the throughput, but if I cluster these old laptops together and one of them doesn't have a NIC capable of that speed, then the whole cluster is going to suffer from a bottleneck across all resources right? \n I guess I don't understand how to determine the bandwidth necessary for resource access in a cluster and if there is a determinable max throughput or if it's just \"the more the better.\" \n My question summarized though is: Will I bottleneck ESXi cluster performance if one of the nodes has a NIC that is significantly slower than the others?\n Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/Hollowpoint357  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The recent power price increases have hit our country hard, and a discussion with the CEO and CFO at Chez Knurpel led to a review of the heavy power users. Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.\n The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)\n Sorry, lights out\n    submitted by    /u/Knurpel  \n [link]   [comments]",

I tested them one by one and discovered 1/6 was DOA, the 5/6 booted but when I tried to take a SMART, it simply wouldn't perform the TEST. It wasn't that there was an error per se, it simply wouldn't perform the test. \n Weary of putting any data on the 5/6 drives even if they recognize. I email their support regarding the issue looking for a resolution. No real response for a week until they sent an email that it was forwarded to their 'IT\" department; however what was weird was the ticket was 'closed'. \n I emailed again to reopen the ticket 3-4 days later but no response. I emailed again another 3-4 days later with the same result. They are simply ignoring the support ticket even though there is a DOA Warranty for 30 days. I'm well paste the 30days and had to pay UPS customs/duties of $185. \n BUYER BEWARE: I heard good things about these guys from the serverbuild forums years ago and thought I would give them a try.

The description says \"up to 1tb in memory mode\". Can you run less than 1TB in different modes? \n #3: TPM Modules: I have to buy a SM branded module right?

          "description": "Hey everyone, I picked up an old Dell poweredge t320 from marketplace recently for a good price. I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct? Any decent places to pick up some ram?\n    submitted by    /u/Senior-Dare-8590  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I want to get some thoughts on a setup to segregate my network a little bit using my current ASUS ac3100 router. I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.\n Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense\n Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.\n Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.\n    submitted by    /u/Khormid  \n [link]   [comments]",

Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.\n Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)\n This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.\n For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.\n After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?\n And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.\n    submitted by    /u/xRoguestatus  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm currently working on becoming a Network Admin (for work) and Systems Admin(for fun because why not) and the next couple of months have finally let me get back to a server I bought a couple of months back (R720 8bay with perc 710 mini). I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)\n I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:\n 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)\n 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives\n I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process\n Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently? ( In the future I want to add PCIe NVMe drives for faster storage just as a side note) Any insight is appreciated and thanks everyone\n    submitted by    /u/RealPhoenixUnBound  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello everybody,\n I've been a lurker here for quite some time, and now that I'm starting to earn some money it's time to get myself a homelab.\n I've already experimented with an HP DL380 G7, but the power consumption was just too much to run it 24/7 (I'm in France so electricity isn't cheap).\n I'd like to build a server with consumer hardware: classic ATX motherboard, Core/Ryzen CPU so I'm not stuck with a motherboard which pulls 50W alone and other hardware which isn't made to be efficient at idle.\n My problem is that I'd like to build this in a rack form factor, ideally a 2U chassis with at least a dozen 2.5\" SAS/SATA bays (I plan to use SATA SSDs because of the lower power consumption compared to HDDs). I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).\n I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?\n So there are two possibilities:\n  \nmy 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;\n I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^\n  \nI hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either. Please don't hesitate to ask questions about my requirements, I may have missed some points!\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Cornichon622  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So I just got some SFP+ NICs and I'm trying to figure out how I can set up Proxmox to use the 10G NICs for all the connections it can, while using RJ45 for communication with APs, any other servers, and devices.\n My first idea was to make a bridge with just the SFP+ NICs, a bridge with that bridge and the RJ45 NICs, and then give that one to OPNsense. However, that would mean any RJ45 servers on the same network would all go through OPNsense when they're on the same VLAN which is unnecessary.\n What's the best way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/Voidnt2  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I used the \"ask a question\" thing to ask the seller what the rating was and how many cores it had. The answer, \"looks like six fibers but don't know the rating\" wasn't a terrible answer, as these things go.

          "description": "For this Christmas i want to do a little upgrade to my node 804 mini server. Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.\n CPU: AMD 5600X\n Desired setup:\n  \n2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0\n 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.\n 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot\n 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.\n  \nDrive quantity:\n  \n8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.\n 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.\n 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.\n  \nSo the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.\n I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.\n Thanks a lot for any guidance!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.\n I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.\n I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?\n Is it also worth looking into other file systems? I just use normal ext4, but I've heard people talk about using ZFS instead, but I don't know much about it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ElnuDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.\n So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .\n But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :\n https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms\n Or you could go back to X86.\n Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.\n You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.\n Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for \"pfsense router\".\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/841ft3v2ckz91.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac555579191683e56468092b6d1fefd7c4fea74\n This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. \n What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.\n    submitted by    /u/EspurrStare  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has yet to be addressed.\n Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.\n In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:\n  \nThe UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.\n The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.\n  \nI'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.\n Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.\n    submitted by    /u/curlybrian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.\n Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.\n My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):\n https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US\n I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.\n Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?\n    submitted by    /u/Vchat20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey HomeLabers... HomieLabbers? HomeboyLovers?\n Anyway, I want to build a new home server. My current is an old gaming PC; AsusMobo, AMDfx, 16GB.DDR3, and GTX 780 running on Proxmox as a single server. \n I'm thinking I can use Pi4s instead of getting new mobo, AM4 and DDR4. I'm new to cluster/stack so my original idea is that I setup a kube environment and run VMs on top, but I don't think that would work. (If I only run server images using docker engine without the need of GUI maybe) So my revised plan is installing Proxmox to each Pi4 node creating a Proxmox cluster.\n My only reason for this is thst I can chuck as many PI4s inside a full ATX case minimizing heat and power consumption. I live in a shared appt so my current is acutally inside my room.\n Have anyone done this before?\n    submitted by    /u/theONLYhotpotato  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I dealt with this on another server and it was a massive headache, just looking for some advice from anyone who had a better experience.\n I have OMV running on a Dell R710, customized to my use, where I have Snapraid and UnionFS running as my raid within OMV. I have this setup over 6 drives for parity but all 6 drive bays are full. I want to swap one of my data drives, as well as the parity, with 2 new 12TB drives which gives me parity for my (now) largest drive of 12TB as well as some more usable data as my existing drives are all 4TB.\n What's the absolutely most safe and simple way to do this? I have Rsync running with google workspace for cloud storage which can also be used as a transfer spot if needed, but I'm thinking there has to be a more simple way than I'm seeing.\n ​\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/FourTimesRadical  \n [link]   [comments]",

I already have a VMware esxi server on a Dell r720 and a Plex server with 28TB on a old i5 6600K running all the ARRs as well (thinking of moving these to Docker, right now they're local installs). I had a 240gb and a 1TB SSD laying around. I installed Truenas on the 240gb. I noticed that I can't do anything with the excess space. So I wonder if is there a better way to run it. I hate wasting space I have several 1TB 2.5 SSDs laying around from various projects over the years I thought about buying a SATA card to run them off of too and use the 240 as a cache drive for the mechanicals. \n What would be the best most efficient way to use TrueNAS? Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way?

The power consumption is low, for all power supplies and the server it is about 120 Watt.\n If I would connect a UPS (Eaton USV Ellipse ECO 800 USB DIN for example) to my small homelab server and the power supplies the breaker problem should be solved or will the breaker of the PSU then blow if the PSU goes offline (power outage longer than battery)?

          "description": "Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.\n With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.\n What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).\n Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.\n Thanks All!\n    submitted by    /u/Lxr200  \n [link]   [comments]",

I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.\n My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.\n From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.\n I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:\n MikroTik\n QNAP\n I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).\n    submitted by    /u/giorivpad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know there is plently of guys on here who are smarter than me when it comes these things and i would highly appricate a helping hand. Thinking about adding a Lsi Logic 9201-16i 16port 6gb/S too for more sata drives to be added and as well use the case Define R5 case as it seems perfect for a large NAS build.\n    submitted by    /u/Thomasthequestion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.\n Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.\n The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.\n Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).\n My question:\n  \nJust how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.\n \nAre there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)\n \nAny other potential issues?\n \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.\n I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.\n I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?\n In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk). This makes backing up data easier to manage, also some disks/volumes/containers I want to encrypt.\n Can someone point me in the right direction?\n    submitted by    /u/wulf_rtpo6338  \n [link]   [comments]",

After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.\n I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?\n Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)\n    submitted by    /u/BigWillyHaverer  \n [link]   [comments]",

It doesn't have wireless and I don't see a reason to spend on the wireless components to put it somewhere around my house, so I figured maybe there would be a cool use case for it in my rack. So far, my homelab is pretty basic. Unraid server with the Arrs, plex, and supporting docker stuff for media. Cloudkey gen2 for my cams and access points. 24port ubiquiti poe switch. R210ii running pfsense and it's adguard. Pretty much sums it up.\n I'm wondering if there is some cool use case for this little guy short of selling it or making it a garage pc. Some sort of homelab use I'm overlooking despite not having a smart home for all that stuff.\n Thanks all, from a rookie.\n    submitted by    /u/Ride1226  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve gotten the okay to turn the downstairs closet into a server/electronics room. \n I plan on putting a rack in there, along with my TV tuner for the house, and whatever equipment our new ISP provides us with. \n The room is a pretty standard laundry closet - you could fit a stacked washer and dryer in there - has a 240V outlet and a 120V outlet. The water supply has been capped and cut off. And there is a vent that goes outside. \n Does anybody have any sort of guidance for this setup?

Mostly I want to do this based on some things I've seen at work going wrong and I was hoping to prototype or at least get an idea how much it would take to home grow a usable system without blowing our budget. \n I believe the access control system should be vlan-ed off from the regular network, but it would need to get updates from a domain controller when access is removed for an individual.\n The system needs to be independent of any cloud services and cannot rely on any internet based token generators due to the system needing to work in the event of communications failure.\n I'm thinking RFID or NFC based cards, because they are cheap to obtain and encode.\n Anyone have experience that can point me in a useful direction? \n I'd like to stick to open source if possible because this is a side project semi-related to work and I don't have a lot of disposable income to throw at it. I just want to build the system and see what kind of dependencies are required to get an idea how much smoke is being blown by security vendors.\n Thanks in advance for any recommendations.\n    submitted by    /u/N0Karma  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The UPS I have is the EP-400-8HTR-1000. It takes 4x7.2Ah 12V batteries. It worked normally providing power. However, the unit would power off after a few seconds on battery power. So, I thought to replace the batteries. \n When I pulled the old batteries out, they all tested ~13v. I put the new batteries in the same way the old ones were, all testing ~13v, and when fully wired shows 26v. \n I plugged the batteries back into the UPS and plugged the UPS into power. Won't turn on. If I disconnect the batteries, it will power on. Connecting the batteries immediately powers the device off. \n Looking for insight to if this is a possible fuse issue or something else?

In any scenario where there is a media server, the idea/goal is to get the content to direct play on the client side. Typically the client devices are an nvidia shield or an apple TV and 95% of the time I'd say those devices direct play (they are hard wired). They seem to only switch to transcoding when subtitles are involved or if the audio stream needs to be changed for some reason.\n I'm looking to see which NUC and/or if a mac mini would act as a good server if it ever had to transcode. The last thing I want to do is recommend a 1k server device and have it lock up while transcoding.\n Some additional information\n  \nno remote users, only local play (meaning, the library is not shared and won't have other family/friends streaming/transcoding/etc)\n very rare that more than one stream will be active at a time\n decent amount of UHD content, but being on the LAN (all devices are wired) as long as the client can direct play, I don't see 4k being an issue\n  \nI wasn't sure where else to post this because this is more of a hardware question vs a media server question. For transcoding purposes, am I looking for something with a built in video card or is the CPU more critical? Or both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for something to run a full fledged VM and/or Kubernetes cluster on.

I'm also not looking to build up a bunch of 3D printed or CNCd cases to put things that were never meant to be in a rack, well, into a rack. So here's some rough critera:\n  \n1U, 2U, or SFF formfactor (Think Project Tiny Mini Micro, small black boxes that can sit two side by side on a 1U rack shelf)\n 16 cores in a node, though preferably more like 32 threads (With or without Hyperthreading)\n Easily upgraded with DDR3 or DDR4 ECC RDIMMs off the shelf. I would like to be able to buy some DIMMs and upgrade the RAM in my existing nodes if I decide I want to expand the lab.\n 10GBE SFP+ built in OR multiple PCIE slots in the chassis to be able to add in my own PCIE cards\n Options to run multiple HDDs (preferably 2.5\" SSDs though even just a pair of m.2 slots would be good enough for a basic node\n Under $1000 for a node, though $200-400 would be even better as I want to buy many of them.\n  \nI'm sure I'm asking too much here, given the promised price, performance, and power consumption that comes with the ARM datacenter revolution, but it would be nice to start deploying ARM at home now that it's a few generations old.\n    submitted by    /u/AsYouAnswered  \n [link]   [comments]",

But if I got to customize one to a ridiculous extent then I'd be interested in a tower style mini rack, sorta like the Dell VRTX.

I could even look into cheap cases off aliexpress as I could probably wait (but shipping is crazy $$ to Australia)\n I thought about an old PC tower off marketplace, reuse the PSU, cooler and lie the case on it's side.

One of the best things I've done is setup our current asset management tool and patching solution in my home lab. I been able to test a lot of cases without affecting our production environment. \n    submitted by    /u/notta_3d  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got almost 800 square feet of basement space, plenty of room to fit at least a half height server rack. But now that I have the space for a rack, I'm questioning if it's even the right choice? I figured I could get old rack mounted servers for cheap off ebay, but most of what I'm finding for cheap is almost 10 years old. Wondering if it would be better to just build a small desktop with a more modern CPU to handle the tasks I have in mind, which are:\n  \nVarious game servers: Minecraft, Terraria, Quake 3, etc.\n Video/Music storage (~20TB)\n Nextcloud\n Jellyfin\n Home security DVR\n Plus a handful of other smaller VMs/containers.\n  \nEnergy costs are pretty cheap where I am so I'm not super concerned about the power draw, and since this will be in my basement noise isn't a factor either.\n What are your thoughts, anybody go with rack mount and hate it?

What is reason for choosing your remote access setup and why is your way more secure than the next guys way.\n My remote access setup! I chose not to use a VPN, I created a domain name, used cloud flare for dns, setup a Ubuntu VM on my proxmox with cloudron image, and use Apache guacamole. Keep in mind I had to use my public IP for DNS, then I forward port 80,443 from my router to my Ubuntu VM.\n Problem, I don’t like the exposure and with cloudron they recommend not updating the image as they push their own security updates to the machine every night. Is this good or bad to rely on someone else to patch any new vulns or is it better that way since I’ll more than likely be late applying any patches.\n I really don’t like having any open ports on my ingress but seems like to remote access any network this needs to happen.\n Questions, comments, SECURITY CONCERNS?\n P.S. thanks in advance, looking forward to all the wisdom\n    submitted by    /u/According_Speed_2081  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is depending on what SSD's i can find and to what price.\n The SSDs need Power Loss Protection (else S2D complains and it's a bad time). Other than that, they need pretty high write endurance, especially if I'm using them as cache (at least 3 DWPD or 4 TBW per day according to Microsoft, though I doubt I'll actually manage to come close to this).\n If I can get the 8 bay version of the R620 them 2 bays will be for boot (raid 1). Then depending on the setup either for hybrid: 2 bays for SSD cache and 4 for HDD capacity, or for all flash: 4 for SSD capacity, 2 for scale-up. (This drivecount is the minimum required by Microsoft).\n I've been looking at intel Ark, and the p3700/p3600/p3500 series seem ok, but they are NVMe and I feel that is a waste. Considering the backplanes can have up to SAS 2 speeds (6 gb/s), thousands of mb/s is just unusable potential.\n I also don't have too much money, so those nvme drives are a good bit pricy.\n If anyone has any recs I'll gladly take them!\n    submitted by    /u/MrMrRubic  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm relatively new to IT as I started working helpdesk two years ago, so I'm fairly certain I don't have the know-how to build something entirely from scratch which leaves me feeling stuck and not knowing how to move forward. I've done my research and looked at tutorials and it all really goes over my head. As far as I can tell, there isn't any instant gratification type of solution where you can get a VM with AD and Exchange already built in ready for you to use. There's trial versions you can download, but they eventually expire and I'm not sure how affordable it is to keep paying for it once the trial runs out. For someone in my position, what are the things I should start learning so I can get to the point where I can eventually build a lab on my own, and be able to construct my own environment that mimics a production server?

I only have two problems and they are with his IPMI.\n  \nThe KVM is only with Java. Is there any update or something that can be done to add an HTML-based KVM to it? Because java doesn't work correctly, when I try to connect to it through the file it downloads to my Mac, it opens and then either crashes straight away or hangs and then crashes. And now I updated the java on my Mac and now it just gives me an error that it can't run this.\n The SSL there only supports TLS 1.0. Is it possible to update it to support at least TLS 1.2? It just seems that OpenSSL needs to be updated there, is there a way to do that?\n  \nThe IPMI version seems to be the most up-to-date - 03.19 \n And the BIOS version is - 3.3\n I would appreciate it if someone has a solution and can help me with this.\n    submitted by    /u/Itay1787  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read the Intel 11th gen doesn't have a good power consumption.\n 1st option:\n  \nCPU: keep the current Ryzen 3700x\n Motherboard: replace the Asus PRIME x470 PRO with the Asrock B550M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \n2st option:\n  \nCPU: Intel i5-12400F\n Motherboard: Asrock H610M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \nOption 2 will cost me 200 euro more than option 1.\n I read the Intel 12th allows the IGPU passtrough, which might be interesting for plex/jellyfin.\n ​\n Questions:\n  \nDoes the mini-itx board consume less then mATX/ATX?\n Does the B550 chipset more efficent (less consumption) than x470? I read the x570 consumes 10-15w compared with B550, but I didn't find anyting related to x470 vs B550.\n Does it make sense go for option 2 (intel build) considering the difference price of 200 euro?\n  \nPower Supply\n Currently I have a Seasonic Focus GX650 (Gold); the node 202 requires to change the PSU with a SFX PSU. Which is best choice between 300W/450W/650W?

I surely want to run: vault warden, calibre web, pihole, filerun, jellyfin, syncthing (with a backup drive) and potentially many more services in docker containers. Besides that I was thinking about setting up proxmox to be able to experiment with different linux distros and setups.\n After watching most of the videos from ServeTheHome and doing a little research I found two models that are available from a trustworthy vendor:\n - Dell Optiplex 7060 Micro i7-8700T 6x2.4GHz 8GB\n - Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro i5-9500T 6x2.2GHz 16GB\n They both have the same price (500 in USD). I want to upgrade the RAM to 64gb anyway and get an NVMe SSD. Which one should I pick? I'm more convinced about the 7060 but I still want to hear an opinion of someone more experienced. Which processor will be better for virtualization with proxmox?\n I'm not completely decided on Optiplex either but it just seems like those machines are more solid and tested than lenovo or hp while being slightly cheaper - might be just my incorrect perception though.\n Any advice or comment is appreciated, I'm still learning how to homelab but it's so fun.

I've done most of the mainstream ones (Grafana, Plex (and the arr services), Wordpress, etc...) but I'm trying to find new ones to play with that I can actually have a use for. \n The first thing that came to mind when I thought about it was Home Assistant cause I haven't really done anything with that yet, but I don't exactly have any devices that would connect up to HA (or if I do, I don't really use them or don't know about them). \n Another thing I wanted to try doing was get a Grafana set up with Power Draw, but realized quick I would need special hardware that I don't really have the time nor money to get. \n Please help me get out of this rut if you have any ideas. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/TaloniumSW  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've come to the realization that I have way too much stuff to keep track of in my head. I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.\n I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.\n If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:\n *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.\n I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.\n Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.\n    submitted by    /u/grumpy-systems  \n [link]   [comments]",

There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.\n I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. \n It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.\n Questions:\n  \nWhat are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?\n How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. \n Is there any fan out there that will not show the \"Fan Failed\" message in the console?

However, I can't really afford to do both of those, the computer I have priced out is around 2k and about 500-1k for the server. How possible would it be to combine the two and run a VM as my workstation? I plan to do a bit of gaming and remote work as a IT tech when I work from home. Gameplanning this, I want two GPU's one for passthrough for gaming and one for anything else I need on my server, like hardware decoding.

That's why I was start to testing all the \"not to do\" stuff. At home I've found an old Dell latitude laptop with i5 and 12 GB ram (extra I add an PWM fan with Ntc sensor for better cooling) , some caddy adapters and now I buy 2 powered USB hub. The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... \n Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. \n Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) \n Just home lab for fun\n    submitted by    /u/VictorSp1987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The new solution.\n Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5\" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.\n So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.\n Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.\n Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.\n    submitted by    /u/knightcrusader  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi there,\n I'm Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)\n I'm based in Europe and I've just setup a small cloud storage service.\n A short story about my initial thoughts on this project:\n I've been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I've noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).\n All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren't many affordable (mind you, $5-$7/TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.\n So I've decided to make a little project to \"fix\" this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?). I've had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.\n I'm basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.\n Requesting Feedback:\n I'm offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(\n You can check it out here.\n I'm already working on the next phase (the first one wasn't anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think it can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)\n Thank you for your time! \n Tom\n PS: I've got approval from the moderators to post this thread.\n PS2: I've made a similar post on Hacker News earlier today, just a small FYI.\n    submitted by    /u/ExtraLayer_eu  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Back in February I picked up an OWC Mercury Elite Pro external enclosure for pretty cheap, as it was open-box. It's a dual drive enclosure with USB 3 and eSATA connections, fairly well built with an aluminum body and fan in the back, and - importantly - has a hardware RAID controller so it can run your 2 disks individually, in Span mode, or in RAID 0 or 1.\n Thanks to Black Friday, I nabbed 2 10TB WD Red Plus drives for a good price, and my intent is to stick them in the OWC, run them in RAID 1 for mirroring, and then connecting the enclosure to a Thin Client PC over USB 3, and then installing Debian to the Thin Client to run everything I need - Plex, backups, maybe some minor game server hosting and file serving.\n The OWC's RAID seems fully featured, if one of the mirrored drives dies, all you need to do is insert a new identical drive and it will automatically rebuild (I would obviously still back up the remaining good drive before initiating the rebuild), I'm just wondering if it sounds like a good idea. On one hand, USB 3 is a very fast standard, but on the other, it feels weird to be running a 10TB mirrored NAS over a single USB cable. Maybe it's a common setup, and I'm just new to this, but I was looking for some reassurance.\n    submitted by    /u/Shadow-Prophet  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just thought I would share my experience if it helps others in Australia with a similar experience.\n I shucked a Seagate 5TB Hard Drive I purchased from Amazon Australia on July 2022. It was in my Unraid server and now refuses to power up at all, completely dead. \n I tried to use the return process on the Amazon site, but it doesn't work since its outside of the 30 day return window. Since the drive itself has a 2 year warranty, I contacted chat. They gave me a standard auto reply of \"You need to go back to the manufacturer for the warranty\" which is not how it works in Australia (in Australian consumer law, the retailer cannot refer you to the manufacturer or importer for warranty repairs). I replied with this information, and the chat officer offered to have someone higher up call me on my phone.\n I received the phone call, and the phone support was perfectly fine. I told them I needed to return a drive for warranty, but it was outside of the 30 days, but still has a 2 year warranty, and that I am in Australia, and purchased from Amazon Australia and needed to use them for the warranty. He accepted it straight away, and sent me a brand new 5TB Seagate Drive (he asked if I wanted a refund or replacement, but since I use it I went with replacement).\n All done and dusted, completely swapped under warranty! Not sure how it works in other countries, but in Australia the manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that shucking the drive caused the failure before they can reject a warranty, and retailer are required to work with the consumer to facilitate the warranty process (they cannot refer to manufacturer).\n If you are in Australia and need to refer to the specific detail around manufacturers warranties, just send them this: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-bought/repair-replace-refund-cancel\n    submitted by    /u/holastickboy  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is really my only server head option atm as don't have the Budget for a new system\n My main issue is: how tf do I hook up all my drives? I have: 4x 4TB 3x 3TB 2x 2TB ~14x (lol) 1TB\n All 3.5in SATA HDDs\n The z2 has a bunch of 10gbit usb ports but not much else. So far I've looked at using an external USB jbod enclosure such as the sabrent 10 bay one, but am totally open to ideas for how to connect server grade hardware to this thing.\n How would you do it? \n Happy to experiment and put up with a reasonable amount of jank, or to try more complex solutions too!\n Cheers!\n    submitted by    /u/jackygrush  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello fellow Denizens of r/DataHoarder\n I just bought 2x14tb WD drives, that I'm adding to my NAS, which is running OMV. It currently only has an 8tb drive in it, on EXT4, which is almost out of space.\n I've been looking into snapraid-btrfs and snapraid-btrfs-runner.\n This and Mergerfs seems to be the perfect combination for my use case of mainly media storage(and maybe a steam cache later) on mixed drive sizes.\n But this is my first time even having enough data/drives to even have to worry about parity/bitrot, so i want to make sure I do it right the first time.\n I have a few things I want to make sure I'm understanding properly.\n 1) So in Snapraid, a 'Sync' is basically creating/updating the parity data on the parity drive. Does updating a parity file go faster if little to nothing has changed on the data drives?\n 2) Snapraid 'Scrubs' periodically check the integrity of a file based off of the Parity data, and timestamp. Still don't exactly get how this one works\n 3) Snapraid Sync will fail if anything is writing to the drives. Snapraid-btrfs gets around this by having Snapraid take a snapshot of btrfs's Read Only snapshots. No idea if that's correct.\n 4) Using Mergerfs and btrfs on my 8tb + 14tb drives, I can fill each drive rather evenly, without striping files. I can use my second 14tb to store the parity file created by Snapraid-btrfs. This should be pretty protected against bitrot, and the rare drive failure, right?(other than files lost between a sync and a failure)\n Sorry this is so long winded. I appreciate any insight :)\n    submitted by    /u/SmolMaeveWolff  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am sorry, I am new in all of this and I am not from english speaking country, so I apologize if I say something incorrect.\n I would like to ask you for a advice, because I am bit lost in this scenario:\n In my computer, I have this three drivers, encrypted by BitLocker: \n  \nA: 500GB SSD - Samsung 860 EVO\n B: 1TB HDD - WD 1003FZEX\n C: 10TB HDD - WD 102KRYZ\n  \nOS: Windows 11 Pro\n Motherboard: MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4\n Would it be possible, to mirror the drive A to the drive C through some kind of a software, where if needed, I would create a basic partition on the drive C so it would be the same size with the drive A. The same scenario I would like to use for the drive B to C, same as A to C. But the data on drive A are the most critical for me and I would like them to survive the trial of time with naively ideally no corruption and so on.\n I understand backups are vital in this, but one of the problems at this time is money, so unfortunately right now, something like NAS is out of question for me. (Note: The 102KRYZ. It was a gift from colleague of mine.) Second problem is, if bit rot happens, even with backups, I will have no idea about it and the backups would get overwritten through time, so ideally, the software for the mirroring should check for checksum, if I understand it correctly.\n Space in the PC is basically taken, so adding later another 500GB SSD would be a bit difficult. Thats why I would like to ask about this scenario and how I could utilize the setup I have to the best of capabilities in protecting my data. \n If this scenario is impossible, then maybe, is there a software for just plainly generating checksum and warning the user, if the files gets corrupted, so you could overwrite it from the backup from other drivers? Just a thought.\n I will be very thankful for any idea, answer or anything to my problem. Thank you if you read my post and If I may, I wish you a very nice day.\n    submitted by    /u/_GreyHeart_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm not new to building PCs but don't consider it a hobby, just something I do in order to have a PC.\n I'm building for a new work rig (high end editing/creation), and putting 3x 6TB Ironwolf drives in there for storage of mostly photo and video files along with SSDs for files currently being worked on.\n I don't want to be playing around all day with the RAID setup, I just want something that works and will allow me to recover if one of the drives die. And yes I know that RAID is not backup! The important files are going in the cloud, also it's not critical data to start with (once the jobs are delivered).\n I'm really attracted to the idea of just using windows storage spaces in parity mode, especially now that I found this article and this one shamelessly ripped off the prior article with no credit but does conveniently have the numbers I'd need for my 3 disk setup to run with better speeds, because let's be honest it was NOT easy wrapping my head around the original article.\n Am I right that this is the right solution for a data noob like myself with my 3 disks? What else should I consider that doesn't involve becoming an expert? Things like TrueNas etc just seem like they're way above my paygrade, and I get conflicting information on hardware raid controller PCI cards (e.g. that it would be difficult to recover in case the card itself dies).

          "description": "Hi! Newbie from Mexico here. I own a Synology DS413j with 3 Western Digital 6TB drives and one Seagate 3 TB using Synology Hybrid Raid. The problem is that this NAS has a very small CPU, very little RAM, so it is really S-L-O-W. Even when doing a small backup from my PC to the NAS, on a 100Mbps network (not even 1Gbps), the CPU jumps to almost 100%. Also, since it's a \"j\" (junior) version I can't run docker or anything else in it.\n So, I'm planning to replace it, and I have 2 options (of course, if you have a better one, I'm all ears).\n Option A: A new Synology Model (\"+\" plus version), with 4 or 5 bays. This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.\n Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. \n My main usage is:\n a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)\n b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)\n c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)\n d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.\n e) As my own personal \"Evernote\", with DS Note on android and windows.\n What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/BarajasFernando  \n [link]   [comments]",

Thanks Autocorrect. \n So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.\n The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.\n Everything running on Plex.\n So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.\n Obviously I can (and have) \"optimized\"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?\n Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?\n Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.\n Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.\n Any pointers would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/slvneutrino  \n [link]   [comments]",

Die technischen Änderungen führten zu einem anderen Aussehen und der Fähigkeit für höhere Brenngeschwindigkeiten, die veränderte Medien-ID sei auf eine Anpassung an andere Verbatim-Produkte zurückzuführen.

Currently I've got a bunch of .mp4 files with data written to the Title and/or Comment fields that I want to replace. I mostly just want to put my movie title in and nothing in the comments field. The name of the file is in Plex format \"%Title% (%Year%)\". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.\n My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas?

          "description": "I found myself scrolling through Github’s “trending” repos. Within the next hour, I stumbled across something called The Sherlock Project. Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.\n I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.\n I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.\n The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.\n Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!\n Whats next? Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think :)\n www.handlefinder.com\n Here is a link to the repo: https://github.com/bnkc/handlefinder\n    submitted by    /u/bnkc  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:\n yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file \"%(comments)#j\" \"%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json\" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s\n ​\n ​\n ​\n    submitted by    /u/sunshinesontv  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.\n Here are my questions:\n  \nI'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?\n \nAlso, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.\n \nlastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?\n \n Thanks,\n    submitted by    /u/machineglow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I’m totally stumped by this one. I figure if anywhere has experience with this kind of thing, it’s probably this sub. The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. \n So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). \n Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. \n So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. \n What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time \n Any help would be appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/HotEukaryoticMitosis  \n [link]   [comments]",

The prices for both are almost the same, with Crucial costing just 15€ more currently. I know that MX500 uses TLC and thus has better write speeds.

          "description": "I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but here goes.\n A bit context: I have (had) an Acer Nitro Laptop, which has a 1 TB HDD, to which I added a 256 GB SSD for OS. I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.\n A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.\n The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.\n Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.\n Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. \n And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.\n PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.\n    submitted by    /u/rbn_juicepop  \n [link]   [comments]",

The Unraid seems to be about 5-10% faster. I'm more confident using the DS918+ and day-to-day that tends to be the device I use more frequently, but I figure the DS918+ is now end-of-life and the stats suggest I'm getting marginally better performance from the Unraid, not to mention future value.\n Is this a no-brainer? Or should I consider keeping the DS918+?\n My total data is only about 25tb, so the 3 x 18tb drives will be sufficient; leaving a spare bay even in the synology.\n Grateful for thoughts.

Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. \n Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. \n Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. \n Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. \n Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table. \n ​\n    submitted by    /u/rlsoundca  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all! I'm using a Pi 4 as a media server and currently using mergerFS to pool multiple drives which works great. I also have a 10TB parity drive and a cron job to do nightly syncs to the parity drive. The issue is the parity drive is nearly full. I just added a 5TB drive as a second parity drive but was looking for a way to pool it in the same way I'm pooling the main drives with mergerFS.\n I'm not currently using SnapRaid but was considering installing/configuring it, but can't quite tell if that will accomplish what I need. Or, is it possible to just use mergerFS and add a second line in /etc/fstab to pool the two parity drives? Then, I would change the cron job to sync to the mergerFS virtual parity drive. \n Any advice is greatly appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/cgjamjcfj  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?\n My second question is, what drives are normally in?\n I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. \n In your opinion, is this achieveable?\n Are there any deals I should look into? \n What would you buy nowadays?\n    submitted by    /u/Oinq  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "At first I was going to get two large 12-16 TB drives and put them into RAID 1, but after thinking about it is putting five or six 4 TB drives in RAID 5/6 a dumb idea for a beginner? The dollar/GB ratio is better and in case of a drive failure it's much cheaper to fix at $80-ish bucks a drive vs $220, but that is a lot more moving parts and probably over double the power in drives. I'm gonna be using it for ripping and hosting the family's DVD collection, my Blurays, PS2 games, and some important file backups. I'll be using a retired 4670k and 16gb of ram as the base for the system.\n Actually, thinking about it now would it just be easier to see how far 4TB RAID 1 takes me and just upgrade to RAID 5/6 (if you can do that) from there if it looks like I can use all of those drives? Honestly I didn't really think about that until now.\n Also, hardware or software RAID? Every time I look it up I see hardware RAID is a headache or software RAID is a headache, so I have no idea what the current consensus is.\n Thanks for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/TwistedD85  \n [link]   [comments]",

Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.\n I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available.

I've already got the drives on the way but I have not ordered the rest of the hardware. Right now I am bidding on an auction for an Optiplex 7040 MT, i7-6700 with 8GB RAM.

Also, what would be the best way to install 11 drives? I'm not afraid of jank, so \"creative\" solutions are welcome. My array plans are for 11 2TB drives with 10 TB logical storage for full parity with 1 hot spare. I will also have 4 cold spares. Here are the solutions I'm looking for ideas on: 1. software.

          "description": "Hi,\n I work in a media production business and am looking for some advice on our current archival process. \n Our projects are typically each 0.5 - 2TB in size, totalling up to 20TB per year, contain mostly media files like video, images, audio and project save files, anywhere between a few hundred to a few thousand files per project. \n Currently, we keep a copy of the project backed up on an office raid server as hot storage.\n As warm storage we .RAR the project into multiple 300GB .rars and store on external drives.\n As cool storage we copy those .RARs to LTO tape. \n If projects get old, we eventually delete the Hot storage off the server, leaving only the .rar on external drive and lto.\n My worry is the reliance on the .RARs. Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.\n I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.\n The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. \n What do you guys think about this current workflow?\n    submitted by    /u/FatherOfTheSevenSeas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all! Hard for me to summarize this, so apologies for block of text. I'll try to bold the more important bits. Thanks in advance.\n I have a 12U Gator rack I won't be using now that I'm selling my DJ equipment, and I want to build a reasonably quiet gaming desktop that's rackmounted. It'll fit nicely with the Furman power conditioner and shelf.\n In case it helps, here's my current PC Part Picker list.\n My problems begin with the rack's depth only being 16.5\".\n That makes finding a rackmount chassis that fits difficult enough. So far the best one I've found (15\" deep, reasonable price) looks to be here:\n Sliger CX4150a\n I'd love to find some 6U or 8U unit so I could get loads of fans running at low speed to keep it quiet and a bunch of 5.25\" bays, but north of 4U appears to be either unicorns, or priced as unicorns. The two other variants of that linked one above (\"i\" and \"e\" suffixes) have one or two 5.25\" bays, but can't fit a deep power supply like that \"a\" variant.\n I don't intend to have dozens of drives hooked up daily or anything. I just want three to four 5.25\" bays available for 1) a Blu-Ray drive, 2) at least one 3.5\" hot-swap bay, and 3) at least one 2.5\" hot-swap bay.\n So I'm wondering if it's possible to have a separate case mounted directly above or below the linked one, and run the SATA and power cables to it (plus extra fans, I assume) for these drives?\n This subreddit just introduced me to \"JBOD\" (funniest acronym ever?), but even with that hint, most of what I'm finding is still into four figures. I'm literally just looking for a 1-2U piece with a handful of 5.25\" bays that wouldn't be too difficult to link into from the other piece.\n Anyone have ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/Weirderal1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I need to get a new storage solution for what's now about 25 TB of data (mostly video files) with room to grow at several TB per year. We previously had some DROBO units but due to downsizing we got rid of the server they were attached to and the units basically bricked when we tried to update the firmware with the intent of moving and repopulating them. So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. \n I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? \n To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this, as my research consistently leaves me with as many questions as answers.\n    submitted by    /u/Hydroc777  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've read multiple articles on the issue but most deal with cost, which in my scenario is a non-issue because I'm already paying for OneDrive (professional reasons) and the family is on the icloud 2TB plan. I'm looking at about 100-300 GB of data. I have apple, windows and linux laptops, also proxmox servers. What I don't have, is a clear-cut solution to syncing OneDrive to iCloud Drive. Two-way sync would be nice, but it's not a must.\n My preferred Apple laptop for this application is an old retina MacBook Pro 2013 that doesn't run Monterey, but I'm willing to buy some SH Mac Mini for this situation. Currently the solution is more important than the cost TBH bceasue I'm looking for a set and forget scenario.\n I'm hoping others can describe solutions if in a similar situation. I was thinking of the following:\n Option 1: Setup a macOS system to do the syncing. Setup OneDrive and iCloud Drive to \"keep all files locally\" and then rsync between the two folders. \n Pros:\n  \nnative syncing of iDrive\n  \nCons:\n  \nmy macOS laptop for this \"application\" is a bit old (2013 rMBP) which is currently unsupported. I don't want to run unsupported OSes for security reasons and I don't want workarounds, especially when settings this up for the next few years;\n dedicated Apple Hardware to do the task, whereas Windows VMs might do the trick;\n Unable to check if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and healthy. When OneDrive might fail, it could desync, but worst case scenario I think it could completely wipeout \n  \nOption 2 Run a Windows VM, signed in to iCloud Drive and OneDrive, both setup to keep all files on device.\n Pros:\n  \ncheapest and most portable\n  \nIssues:\n  \nas above, unable to automcatically check and resolve if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and sync is healthy.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/blucafee80  \n [link]   [comments]",

She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.\n Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive.

It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.\n Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.\n So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).\n So, I could use some guidance on:\n 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?\n 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?\n 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?\n 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this?

I would also like to thank every one who uploaded different sets of these magazines on archive already. Without them putting everything together simply wouldn't be possible. I can not and will not take credit for there hard work and dedication to preservation. I just wanted to get everything together in one package for everyone to be able to have easy access to all of them. Thank you so much for all the awards and appreciation but please thank them as well. They deserve it more than I do. \n I have every single issue of nintendo power magazine all 285 issues of it uploaded to archive.org\n https://archive.org/details/nintendo-power-issue-128\n magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8a1a883270f3f094150ce258a26b4ca581839153\n https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d69aOgbHU_hrI--Ie5Xhf84fHOkk6lMd/view?usp=share_link\n magnent and back up of the original archive.org torrent.\n Last time a big set of these were on there nintendo took it down so I'm sure it will happen again sometime. Either way I have them all backed up on my hard drive as well and was wondering how a good way to preserve all of these would be. Reason being is because as far as I know from days of looking and researching. There is no complete set of these magazines outside of the one I just uploaded last night. I used many existing sources to get them all with the help of some awesome dudes I met in another subreddit who had 2 i was missing to complete the set. If anyone wants to help preserve these before nintendo comes a swinging it would be very much appreciated. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/Gumball1989  \n [link]   [comments]",

I really like that they (supposedly) don't open the factory seal and re-test the drives like ServerPartDeals does. If the manufacturer just recertified a drive, I don't want a seller opening it and re-testing ya know?\n Edit: I'm starting to think it's probably better to get a \"Manufacturer Recertified\" drive than a \"Factory Refurbished\". Refurbished likely means it was a repaired drive that was bad, when a Recertified should indicate a returned/open box drive. Does this logic sound right?\n Any opinions are appreciated cause I trust y'all.\n ------------------------------------------------------------\n Factory Refurbished from DiscTech:\n https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-Exos-X16-ST16000NM001G-16GB-512e-SATA-Hard-Disk-Drive\n This is what they said when I asked about them testing it:\n https://preview.redd.it/xrzy2draqzz91.png?width=610&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a480b31369765e87bb828bbae3de62a8db9c00\n Manufacturer Recertified from ServerPartDeals:\n https://serverpartdeals.com/products/seagate-exos-x16-st16000nm001g-16tb-7-2k-rpm-sata-6gb-s-512e-4kn-256mb-3-5-fastformat-manufacturer-recertified-hdd\n Update: DO NOT buy from DiscTech's eBay store if you want their 1 year seller warranty.

I was able to get a cheap Optiplex which seems to fit quite well for my use case. Problem I have now is, that I read, that the HBA cards are getting quite hot and in that Optiplex SFF won’t be to much space to provide proper cooling. At the beginning I was thinking of a new case (Nanoxia deep silence rev 6b to fit everything in one case), but with that Optiplex a case swap seems to be quite hard. Building the whole thing new from scratch would cost way more then use that Optiplex. Now I thought of getting a random tower put that HDDs in there connect them to a power supply and then link them to an LSI HBA 9200-16e which I would then plug into the Optiplex. Is the card going to be to hit then? Should I just leave the case of the Optiplex open and this will do the job? Or will it be better to just plug in USB Drives into the Optiplex?\n If building an external enclosure all I really need is that HBA card (it mode), a case, a usual power supply and the SAS to SATA cables, right? \n Any other solution or ideas?\n    submitted by    /u/locopivo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing is that the company charges for storage used even if the server is turned off.\n So I was wondering what could I use to make an entire backup of the whole server and copy it to my computer? \n Ideally it would be great if I could make some kind of whole-computer-backup or something that allows me to kind of create an \"image\" or something and in the future re-install the image in another computer and have exactly the server as it was (but on my local network for example). \n The thing is, since it's a cloud server, I don't know if that's even possible?\n Thanks in advance for your help\n    submitted by    /u/OrangeRabid  \n [link]   [comments]",

My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. \n As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini. I know that mac has limited ext4 support, but I'd prefer to run the drives in a mac-native (still cross-platform) file system. \n So my questions are:\n  \nWhat filesystem would work best in this case? I have heard good things about exfat, and it seems like a good cross-platform option. I am also open to APFS.\n How best can I go about migrating my data onto the new filesystem? Is there a tool that can do this?\n As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_CINN4M0N_  \n [link]   [comments]",

All these 'lifetime' packages kinda freak me out since lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of the product and nothing else.\n To explain further my 'sidehustle' is photography and well, it takes up a lot of space. Currently I'm using backblaze to backup my stuff, but I hate the retrival they offer and the fact that the service works kinda slow (my line is 3/3gbit and the upload never goes over 150mbit).\n So I'm currently trying out iDrive (since it was dirt cheap like 4eur / year for 10TB). Works fine for the price, the file retrival is better, but they don't offer sufficient storage capacity for me.\n Any other services out there that will not break the bank and will work?\n Thanks!\n Edit: Currently I need 60TB of storage\n    submitted by    /u/shorto  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know it's a problem with the enclosure because the drive works fine as an internal drive running off a normal computer SATA power cable. Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.\n Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures?

          "description": "The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. \n Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).\n So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBirdOfFire  \n [link]   [comments]",

Based on the fact that it's only like 1 inch thin I'm certain it's an SSD external drive.\n How reliable are SSD external hard drives? Should I expect it to fail soon? Like an old conventional magnetic disk drive could? It's kept on a desk at room temperature, never moves and just collects a bit of dust that I periodically clean off. Is this a safe device to keep pictures, music, files, etc. on? Or should I begin making plans to replace it?\n    submitted by    /u/Daily__Reminder  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyLegend1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).\n Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.\n Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5\" bays and is less than 19\" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.\n ​\n Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?\n This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082\n This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/\n This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179\n    submitted by    /u/icelandismine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.\n This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.\n I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow.

I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.\n The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.\n TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.\n Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...\n    submitted by    /u/KRS_88  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there an elegant way to start copying files to the 4tb drive to the first 1tb drive until it runs out of space, then wait till I swap it with an empty drive, and then keep copying, keeping track of all the drives needed to do this in order? I don't want the drives in RAID, because that would require plugging all of them in at once, and I also don't want one drive failing taking the data stored on all the other drives with it.\n Isn't this how tape drives work for storing huge drive arrays? It should be pretty standard archival practice right?\n Ideally, I don't want to have to fully reassemble the data to find something. I want to be able to plug in a drive, search around for what it contains out of the larger drive, and copy individual files back without doing a full restore. Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. \n Is there a solution that can do all this?

          "description": "This is a \"problem\" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.\n The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.\n One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on \"disk1\" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.\n To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.\n Some info about my system:\n  \nOS: Arch Linux\n Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1\n Asus Prime H510M-K\n Intel i3-10100\n 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)\n Disks directly connected to the motherboard\n  \nI experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.\n I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.\n I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.\n    submitted by    /u/bepsifif  \n [link]   [comments]",

There's some concern for his wellbeing in the 3d community here on Reddit as his last couple of videos have had some statements in them that have a few people speculating.\n For those who aren't in the 3D world, his tutorials were some of the best, most specific and most useful tutorials out there for beginners and professionals alike converting everything from basics to very in depth modelling across various pieces if software .\n Has anyone got an archive? Was anyone backing up? If would be a huge blow to the 3D community to lose this knowledge.

I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.\n The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...\n Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression? Seems pretty ridiculous, but I'm kind of curious about it.\n Clearly thought, an image cannot just stay inside an MKV container, it's too much of a pain.\n Sorry for the weird question and thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/LynxesExe  \n [link]   [comments]",

I used all the feedback from here to make it, so thanks again <3\n Yeah... I didn't have anything else to do, and went for a basic setup, it's ugly\n In the end, only Syncthing isn't Cloud based. But no matter what, it's an useful tool that i'll keep as a bonus tool anyway haha.\n As you can see, Filen is really getting the lead for me. But as in the bad points, my biggest fear is the Life Time Scam.\n So I wanted to know if anybody used Filen and have a good experience with the Life Time thing ?

I use it to repack high quality manga on my Kobo, it more than doubled the amount I can store at once.\n I know such repacking software already exists because people post on manga sites all the time, but I couldn't find any scripts online, much less ones that were easy to use. This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.\n Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.\n The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.\n This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.\n https://github.com/avalonv/reCBZ\n    submitted by    /u/reallyfuckingay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. \n I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault\n It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.\n So my best thought is that ideally \"everyone\" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.\n Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the \"library of alexandria\" idea.\n Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.\n Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group!

I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. \n I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. \n I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB. That being said, I can deal with smaller capacity for now and get one of those 60 drive behemoths a couple years later.

Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.\n  \nBut what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?\n From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? \n If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? \n And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk? (and prevent bitrot)\n Also, how frequently should we be doing this? ..every 3 months? ..every 6 months? ..every year? \n How many of you guys are storing drives offline like this? And have you ever lost any data this way due to bad storage or data getting corrupted somehow.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/masterofmisc  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My friend and I are looking to ramp up deals and restock articles on our tech/lifestyle blog, but we're lacking the tools to monitor real-time pricing and availability of a large assortment of products we've selected from multiple online retailers.\n Ideally, we'd like to see:\n  \nItem/SKU\n Price\n Retailer\n Commission rate (optional)\n  \n...Preferably with the ability to export that data to Excel.\n I've tried Restockify but it's extremely limited in functionality and the types of products you can track. We want to monitor everything from smartphones on Samsung.com to sneakers on StockX.\n He also mentioned a few bots that scalpers use, like StreetMerchant and NerdSpeak/NerdSeek; however, those tend to either break or also face the same retailer limitations as Restockify.\n To be clear, we're also not looking to scalp. We just want more comprehensive updates on product inventory at places like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, GameStop, etc. to tweet and write articles about them for everyday consumers as an extension of our product reviews arm. Pretty standard affiliate marketing content.\n As an example, Future plc (publisher behind TechRadar, Tom's Guide, PC Gamer, etc.) has a working proprietary version of exactly what we're looking for. I'm just wondering if there's an open-source application or paid service we could use that meets the same needs.\n    submitted by    /u/FrackingEnthusiast  \n [link]   [comments]",

Apparently my search skills are lacking, because I can't find anything I want when I type in \"Backup my Android phone to my PC automatically from anywhere\". And I've tried every configuration of said search.\n Background - IT management (for a school district, so not rich) who is getting near retirement and now has grandkids.\n So - what I'm looking for is two-fold.\n  \nI want something similar to my Drobo I used to have, without giving up too much of my hard earned money - close to retirement as I mentioned above. Something that can backup all of my PCs, servers, documents from the last 25 years, and maybe stream some movies and music. DAS or NAS, I'll figure it out either way depending on the price point.\n I want some software that will allow me to backup my children's pictures, as well as my pictures from anywhere. It would be great if it could also backup my OneDrive, Google Drive etc. My son is up at Ole Miss, my daughter and son-in-law are in Jacksonville, FL. He is a Marine. One is 5 hours away from me, the other is 10. I want all those pictures and videos of my grandchildren backed up for eternity. We'll print out the most important and store them somewhere safe. I want to be able to access it from my phone from anywhere to see the pictures stored locally on my home computer/Drobo or similar storage device.\n  \n​\n So - there must be someone on here who is like me and researches this crap until their eyes bleed trying to find the best solution for the very best price. I'm am open to any and all suggestions, even the convoluted ones that are free but require and insane amount of work. Thoughts?\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/jtbryant  \n [link]   [comments]",

Service would be available EU wide.) \n But first disclaimer: I will obviously not take any answer as legally credible ones. I am just looking for some guidance and knowledge.\n I plan on renting out some storage to some friends and friends of friends (at first). What are the potential pitfalls doing so? I am thinking for example, what if someone uploads a copyrighted movie and uses my platform to share it. (I think this is the most likely scenario to happen, but you guys can maybe think of more) \n What am I to do, to prevent malicious use and what am I responsible for? What kind of legal charges could be made against me if a user uses my service like this.\n I own a registered business and would make individual contracts with each user including sending out invoices etc. So I know every user by name, adress and bank details at least. I think that should prevent the most evil kind of malicious use but I am still worried about some of the lesser ones. \n Every thought about this topic is appreciated. \n Cheers and happy hoarding\n    submitted by    /u/Sinath_973  \n [link]   [comments]",

And if so, is there a way to compare the disk with the created backup to check if there has been an bugs which created a quality loss (for example by not copying some files)\n A little exkurs - do DVDFab, AnyDVD and MakeMKV differ in the creation of the output (video files like mkv) talking about quality or are they same?\n    submitted by    /u/d3crypti0n  \n [link]   [comments]",

Occasionally I use the NAS to stream some videos to my TV. I don’t use the NAS for anything other than that. Since buying a new camera, my storage capacity is filling up very quickly. \n It’s very important to me that I don’t lose these files so I have the drives set in RAID1. (I’ve been reading up on this subreddit and I am also going to make an extra copy on an external hard drive to store at another location.)\n Using a NAS for this has really been working great for me since I don’t need to worry about backing up or anything, I am always sure that my files are stored on 2 drives. \n What should I do? These are the options as I see them:\n Option 1 is to buy new drives with bigger capacity and use these to replace the drives I already have. \n Option 2 is to buy a NAS with 4 bays. Keep my 2 existing drives and buy 2 new drives to expand the volume. \n Are these options any good? Maybe you guys have different suggestions?

          "description": "Hi all,\n I normally buy Seagate hard drives and have had good experience with their RMAs, especially since they still include return shipping as part of their Advanced RMA program (at least they did last year) and their staff is on-shore in North America.\n One of myWD Red 10TB died over the weekend in my unRAID setup after <2 years of service so I setup an Advanced RMA for $25 USD, so far so good, but the drive that they sent me was DOA, it won't even boot - can't be recognized in my USB dock nor in my server's SATA slots. So much for being \"certified\".\n DOA should not be a problem right?\n Most companies will take care of customers when it's their issue, so I call up WD, and they say:\n  \nThere can only be one Advanced RMA outstanding\n They will setup a standard RMA for the DOA replacement\n They want me to ship the DOA replacement and then WD will send the replacement - so much for \"Advanced RMA\".\n  \nI paid $25 for Advanced RMA, and I got nothing out of it except a DOA drive - now I have to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement drive. Amazing they're so inflexible with their RMA system, I guess that's what happens when all the staff is outsourced overases.\n I'm surprised at the bias towards WD, especially with how poor their RMA process is. This alone is going to put me off buying WD drives for my NAS even if Seagate supposedly has a higher failure rate (which they may, but replacements are easy to come by!).\n Anyone else facing troubles with WD RMAs?\n I have about 50 - 60 drives in my various NAS devices, and this is the second time in a row that I've had issues with WD RMAs, during 2020, it took several months to get my RMA back, and the lack of communication and inflexiblity of their RMA department doesn't seem to be addressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Onion  \n [link]   [comments]",

But can't seem to find much that differentiates one from the other beyond 'I use it and it works.'\n I currently have EaseUS. And... well... It's time I move on. \n I'm looking for something I can use to restore from bare metal in the event of a drive failure, with a secondary use for getting older versions of files or something I've deleted and decide I want again.\n Primarily, I'm looking for something that has great compression / de duplication. Keep the archive as small as possible. I'm willing to trade higher compression / smaller size for a longer restore time.\n  \nIncremental / daily backups too. \n \nI'm fine with paid, though I would prefer something I own outright and isn't contingent on a subscription.\n \nBig bonus would be if I can back up directly to a network share, though that's not a deal-breaker for me.\n \nI see veeam and macrium thrown around a lot. But I'm unclear on the usability differences between them. Or if there's newer/better stuff.\n \nIt must have encryption on it of some sort. I don't put anything off-site that isn't encrypted, so this one is a need-to-have.\n \n Anyways I've looked at enough suggestions that now I'm a bit overwhelmed and could really use some guidance.

Veracrypt, Boxcrypt solves this problem by adopting a volume based approach but it's not suitable for cloud storage.\n Some tools I've used:\n  \nRclone - By far the most stable but sadly it neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening. By using the crypt remote, the files sizes do change, but it's a static transformer which can be easily deciphered to get plaintext size. By using chunker along with crypt, file sizes could be hidden to some extent, but not completely.\n Cryptomator - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Securefs - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Gocryptfs - Neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening.\n CryFS - Supports both file size obfuscation and directory flattening !! In theory this should be a good fit, but sadly it suffers from terrible performance issues due to the fact that it chunks files into fixed size small blocks (4kb - 32kb). The block size can be configured but it poses some other issues.\n  \nI've tried all sorts of combinations but it's either unstable or hacky. Looking for any leads here.

They always manage to do something incredibly... wrong for a lack of a better word and lose pictures. Usually saved because it is in the deleted folder but there have been pictures that have been completely wiped. \n So to tackles this, I was thinking of setting up a NAS Drive but I don't know how much space would be apt. I myself have 110GB worth of pictures. My family members to have more. It's likely to be a home server? I am not sure. \n I wondered if I could give each family member 1TB of space. But only they can access it with their own password. Nobody can access any drive except their own. Which means if they forget their password to access the drive then... oops, oh well (I am done helping them when they forget their password).\n What would be the best way to get something like this set up?\n EDIT: I suppose I could back up everything to the cloud but many family members don't want me to see their pictures. I am not sure if a cloud service with specific folders for each person where only said person can see files exist. However, I am open to this idea too.\n    submitted by    /u/BrexitBlaze  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm currently using a Ubuntu 22.04.x VM with ZoL with the PERC H730 passed through.\n To get a single share I'm currently using mergerFS to combine my pools + gdrive. Biggest issue is that mergerFS as far as I've seen just prioritizes the first \"drive\", fills that up and them moves to the next drive without any kind of distribution. That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.\n The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now. Is glusterfs a good option to get that single point of storage and share or are there better options now?\n Current setup\n    submitted by    /u/_-Smoke-_  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I like to name my photos and videos in the yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss format so that when I sort them by name, all the photos and videos of a particular event show in the order they were shot in, not to mention that memories shot by different people of the same event shows in an integrated manner.\n I have used XNView for years on Windows. I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.\n Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.\n Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).\n Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.\n I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.\n Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?\n    submitted by    /u/GuruDev1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).\n Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/J0mSp00ns  \n [link]   [comments]",

( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. \n My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array.

The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.\n First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.\n  \nMacroit says they're each just one large logical partition\n AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions\n Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.\n  \nWhen I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.\n I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.\n I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.\n    submitted by    /u/ArcTechNerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

One of them is 7200rpm, other is 5400rpm (wd30ezrx) but its quiet fast, maybe its one of those 7200rpm but with a wrong marketing name like its said in here\n https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/ikk0rv/psa_multiple_wd_5400rpm_drives_are_actually/\n Anyway, when I plug the 7200rpm one, my PC is fast. But when I plug the 5400rpm one, it gets slower a bit, and my pc freezes for a second every 3-4 minutes.\n I formatted it a few days ago, but when I try to format it now, it has this problem https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owtZoGb4n3E , which is \"Windows Cannot Format This Drive\".\n This might also help https://i.imgur.com/oooJs4T.png Is there anything wrong here?\n There are some answers here\n https://www.quora.com/Why-does-my-computer-slow-down-so-much-when-I-plug-in-a-second-hard-drive\n but they say, change some settings.

Then I discovered Mylio, which has some pretty awesome facial recognition.\n It will recognize a face from a photo, you tell it who that face belongs to, then for all of the examples it has of that person, it'll try to recommend more photos who it thinks are the same person. It gets more and more confident the more examples it has, and you can customize the level of confidence required for it to \"guess\" about a person's identity if the matches you're getting aren't good enough or something.\n It works great, for photos at least, and it runs locally on my PC and is accessible via the mobile app if I'm on the same network. However, it's not free past a certain point, and the tagging tools and certain other parts of the desktop and mobile apps leave a lot to be desired.\n Does anyone know of a similar application/system/script I can run in order to do the same thing?\n    submitted by    /u/_Ev  \n [link]   [comments]",
