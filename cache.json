          "description": "Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.\n The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.\n So the procedure:\n  \nCreate a new folder in your APP / Server, for example \"Mobile Photos\".\n Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload\n Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and \"Configure\".\n Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option \"The original file will....\".\n Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)\n Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.\n Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.\n  \nProblems:\n  \nFor some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.\n I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a \"Photo Folder\", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.\n  \nSo hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a system that can contain off of this.\n I am hoping to find a Self Hosted (hopefully FOSS) application that we can use as a CRM for our family. We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).\n My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.\n What I have looked at and dismissed:\n  \nHomechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.\n Monica - This is for tracking personal connections. While cool, not exactly what I am looking for.\n 'Real' CRMs - hubu, itflowly, salesforce, etc. These are just way to over the top and expensive\n  \n​\n Edit: A workable solution was determined so far, but still open to ideas: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ypt9hh/comment/ivm4mm6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n    submitted by    /u/webtron18  \n [link]   [comments]",

So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. \n So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). \n So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries. I ultimately end up with it all.\n    submitted by    /u/Unifi-Equipment-Noti  \n [link]   [comments]",

Metlo is a self hosted, open source API security platform that inventories, tests and protects your API endpoints.\n - We inventory your endpoints by scanning API traffic and detecting all your endpoints along with the sensitive data they contain\n - We generate information your security team may find useful like Open API Specs and risk scores for each endpoint\n - After this we discover vulnerabilities like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data or missing HSTS headers\n - Finally Metlo detects any anomalous behavior on sensitive endpoints in real time so you can detect 0-day attacks as they're happening\n We have a sandbox for you to play around with here http://demo.metlo.com/. Also, Here's a demo video if you would like a quick walk through of the product :)\n https://www.loom.com/share/349c9e5f267741e9a0fcd2dfd1f9956f\n We’d really appreciate your feedback and ideas, and are happy to answer any questions!\n EDIT: We - me and my cofounder. We'll be monitoring this post for a while! :)\n    submitted by    /u/shrisukhani  \n [link]   [comments]",

I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.\n I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...\n Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...\n I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:\n - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?\n - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.\n I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.\n Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ?

Nothing is exposed to the Internet, everything runs behind a VPN.\n Now I would like to tinker with some services that need to be joined over the Internet (ie: some test websites, Wallabag, reverse proxy with Authelia...), probably in Docker as well.\n I wouldn't like to run them directly on my NAS because:\n  \nI care about my personal data,\n From my experience, there are too many security flaws in Docker images we didn't think about before exposing them to the world,\n Docker on Synology is so outdated anyway that I don't trust it.\n  \n​\n From my readings, the next step for me was buying a NUC/Tinyminimicro/whatever and setting some containers reading data from a dedicated NFS folder on my NAS.\n But I'll just run a few services, the machine would idle most of the time and add 10-15W to my electricity bill.\n ​\n So now I'm thinking about running publicly exposed services in a VM running on my NAS:\n  \nThis one has enough RAM & CPU to handle a few services in a VM so it's more power-efficient,\n Public services would run with or without Docker, but on the VM,\n Important data would be accessed via NFS (even if it's the same physical machine) on a specific folder, so it would be easier to backup,\n If a service is attacked, the data would be backed up (replication, distant backup, and so on). At worst, my VM is killed but it's no big deal.\n  \n​\n If I resume my idea, I want to add a layer (the VM) for better isolation between my public services and my NAS.\n Do you think it's secure enough for most attacks, or I shouldn't trust the VM isolation and buy a different physical machine?\n ​\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/grospoulet  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have searched all over and have not come up with even a partial solution that would be self-hosted.\n I live in a WISP environment (Wireless Internet Service Provider), which I have no control over the WiFi APs. My access to the outside world is through WiFi using a router in a wifi bridge mode; no Ethernet connections are available. The architecture of the WISP system, WPA2-Enterprise, allows other apartments to connect to the AP in my apartment which has several SSIDs. Every apartment has an AP in it and act similarly.\n What I am looking for is a Monitoring/Analytics solution which gathers continuous passive WiFi environment information over time such as WiFi slowdowns, WiFi outages, number of WiFi clients attached to an AP MAC address, signal levels, number of WiFi disconnects/reconnects, etc. This is similar to what could be obtained by using Kismet with a filter to gather real time statistics. I would also like to not run out of disk space over a week if at all possible.\n Does any solution for this problem exist? Or, alternatively, could something like this be cobbled together from existing self-hosted parts? Thanks for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/linuxweenie  \n [link]   [comments]",

They had both been working fine, but I borked my Nextcloud install so have started from scratch using NGINX as the webserver rather than Apache2. \n I used certbot to install a certificate for the internal domain (lets call it nc.internal.com for now), and it's working great on the local network. I want to use Cloudflare to make it available on the external domain (nc.external.com), so I've set up the DNS record for nc.external.com to point via my tunnel.\n However, whenever I enter nc.external.com into my browser I get the \"too many redirects\" error, and sure enough I can see lots of 301 Permanently Moved errors.\n My other apps are still working on thei external domains.\n I've tried changing the SSL/TLS settings in Cloudflare to every setting possible (Full (strict), Full, Flexible and Off), but these haven't helped.\n Wondering if anyone has any pointers or ideas?\n Kevin\n    submitted by    /u/captainkev76  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am also, unfortunately, at the intersection of \"worried about security\" and \"don't know enough to know what enough security is\". I really didn't like the fact that docker ignored my firewall rules and opened ports on the iptables, so I made a custom bridge network and didn't publish any ports. In this way, I had hoped to be able to solely publish ports 80 and 443, routing everything else through the custom docker network. This felt safer. The massive problem with this is that it works - kind of. I can generally get to a service, but not always. However, if I get to them, they will be intermittent at best. They drop a LOT of communications via time out. I tried netdata to see if the system was struggling - seems not at all. I took the services out of the bridge network and published the ports normally - everything works great. This makes me assume I did something wrong on the network.

But then, the *arr app may not find what I want, even tho I can go into prowlarr, manually search for it, and find it immediately. Why is that?\n Also, I have configured qbittorrent to do sequential downloads. That way I can see the Linux ISO form right in front of my eyes, byte by byte, which lets me enjoy it as soon as it begins downloading.\n The problem with that, is that the *arr apps won't move the file until it's completely finished downloading, so Jellyfin doesn't see it. I set up a workaround by adding qbit download folder to Jellyfin, and that works, and I can start watching immediatly, but it's wonky, and things aren't properly separated.\n Has someone done something similar?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

The concept is, it only takes a millisecond or two to generate config files on the fly, so why not do that. Any important information, such as domain names and user names are stored in a single json file. I wrote a tool in rust which takes this information and inserts it into config templates. A single command installs the software, then the whole thing is already working.\n The web control panel is an optional package, and each service is also a separate package, you only install what you need. I wrote an install script with a menu to make it easy. The install script will also have an autonomous mode which can install the required packages without any interaction, which makes it easy to use with docker.\n I'm still working on the web control panel and a bunch more services. Currently I have dns hosting with named/bind, web hosting with nginx, haproxy, php-fpm, and lets encrypt, and email hosting using postfix. Websites are hosted each with an independent user and nginx instance. All this is configured automatically as each service starts. I'm working on adding support for hosting minecraft servers, managing backups and zfs pools, and other services as needed.\n Aside from a few bugs I'm still working on, my own use of the software has been smooth sailing. Hoping to continue work on it and make something great. The source code is currently private, while I still have some security concerns, but can grant access on request. I have faith in open source.

Using Radicale as a backend and Tasks.org as mobile app, everything works easily. I evaluate several solutions and this is the better one: Radicale is mature and updated, tasks.org connect to it without the need of DavX5 or other things. Very very good.\n Now, the problem is that the basic docker default config of Radicale does not have any kind of users management, in the login page you just insert a name (and no pwd, even if the field exists...) and if the username exists, you are enabled to see and manage (delete too) all its items; if it does not, a new user is created!\n As said I read some docs but I do not understand too much: I just need that users should have a password and that only users I authorize can login, so no automatic user creation. It seems I have to specify \"users list\" and \"users config file\" in the \"radicale config file\"; \"users config file\" details resources access for users.\n So, the question is: how have you solved this situation? Might you publish the config files you have? I just need 3-4 private calendars for family members and one shared.\n    submitted by    /u/wireless82  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the VPS are probably around 15 Things running.\n Anything that has a high reliability requirement and especially when it requires fast internet runs on my VPS. Currently it's a mess, things running with docker compose, things running with docker run (so the configuration is floating in space) and some things just barebone installed and running in some process managers or systemctl, messing with each other and breaking apt-get requirements.\n I'm planning to restructure everything into containerization, just unsure how. \n I have seen people use portainer (tried it, wasn't flashed), kubernetes (does that even make sense here? Sadly don't know a lot about it) or just plain docker-compose files and running commands.\n Is there some sort of guide/comparison that compares different approaches and their use cases. Would also be interested on the opinions of others, I'm really unsure about this.\n My time is fairly limited so I don't want to spend weeks trying different approaches or having to switch between them because something didn't work out.\n Thanks for any replies\n    submitted by    /u/stehen-geblieben  \n [link]   [comments]",

While also not leaving myself open to any attacks.\n I have an AWS EC2 instance up and running and have Wireguard running between it and my local network. To be more specific I have my local machine connected to the VPS. The VPS has iptables to move UDP traffic on both 16261 and 16262.\n I have also configured Traefik to forward the data to the correct server. I cannot seem to establish a connection to the game server. I have tested with both a VPN on my client to make sure I am connecting from the outside internet and without the VPN. In the diagram I want data to flow in via the blue line through all the respective connections. Then the red line out and back to the client so they can play on the server.\n I also realize that this can pose some latency issues and an inability to ban by IP. I really could care less about that. I want to mitigate DDoS or any form of attack that isn't based on an exploit in the game. If the game has an exploit then that is a whole other issue I will worry about. This is about minimizing the attack surface not the optimal way.\n https://preview.redd.it/vzjww5julex91.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6467aca37b9b897ff7388df2189779cf3f0b69c\n    submitted by    /u/IcyBlackAgeis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked at a lot of the commonly recommended backup solutions (kopia, duplicity, duplicati, etc) and they all seem to require installation and configuration per server, so I'd have to set up and install on each server individually.\n Is there anything selfhosted (short of a cronjob + rsync script) that would allow me to backup multiple servers (all linux - mostly debian with a few raspberry pis) that is centrally managed?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/themostevilchicken  \n [link]   [comments]",

External users should have read-only access to specific areas.\n a user database with own attributes per user and a simple user administration for technology beginners (e.g. Keycloak with a simpler user admin UI).\n email boxes that are easy to set up. An admin should simply say what name the mailbox should have and every allowed user (from the identity provider) should then have access via an email client. A ticket system is also welcome.\n a file storage (e.g. Nextcloud).\n a wiki.\n a registration form for events. The price may vary per pre-selection.\n  \n​\n The requirements are as follows:\n  \nwe have a little more than 1000 members. Each member should have their own account, which in the best case should already exist and must be provided with a password when logging in for the first time. We already have the e-mail addresses and other information in an Excel spreadsheet.\n security: if possible at least password policies and/or two-factor authentication. If the new passkeys feature is already supported, that would be even better. Also, users should be able to be logged out of all services immediately. It should also be possible for our chairperson (over 60) to assign roles to services.\n if an e-mail, name or any other attribute changes in the identity provider, this should also be changed on all other systems as soon as possible.\n  \n​\n I know C# and web development with PHP well, so I could also write smaller plugins myself.

My question:\n  \nCan an Amazon FireStick access USB storage attached to the TV? I tried installing ES File Explorer (which supports FTP) but it only sees the FireStick's internal storage.\n \nMy Samsung TV is UE40H6400 and it seems I can not connect to the Samsung servers, I'm assuming because the TV is out of support. Does anyone know where I can find a list of .apk packages that are supported on this TV? If I can install (for example) ES File Explorer on the TV instead of on the FireStick, I'm assuming that the external storage attached to the TV will appear as accessible.\n \nIs there a better way to do this? I just want to avoid having to go through the whole process of connecting my external storage to my PC, moving media to it, disconnecting and reconnecting to TV, playing the media, disconnecting and reconnecting to PC... and so on each time I want to watch something not from a streaming service.

It could be done each 1 hour or something like that.\n I would like to have this kind of monitor because I have had 2 issues in the server (one related to a Postfix update, and other one related to certificates) and I didn't get any alarm... so the issues produced mail delivery failures during some days until I noticed the mail were not working :-(\n Is there any service which could help me? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/yvoictra  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the end goal is for me to self-host 'something', I'm just not sure what it would be. \n I work from home, and my wife is a stay at home mother. We have a family calendar via iCloud, and I obviously have a work calendar (I am in lots of meetings) that I can't share with her. \n I'm trying to find a way for her to schedule personal appointments (where I'd need to watch the baby while she's gone) but make sure it's not done during existing meeting I have at work. \n Right now I've tried blocking off 2 x 3 hour windows each week, but that's not really feasible as they mostly go unused by her, and I need to be able to schedule calls during them. \n So I need to find some way to either anonymize my work meetings and upload them to a shared calendar so she can figure out when 'not' to schedule her appointments, or find a way so the appointments she schedules for herself end up on my work calendar. \n I've got the ability to self host anything I need to to help make this happen, I'm just not sure if such a thing is even possible, let alone what products/technologies I might need to pull it off.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a single host (10.1.10.10) running 20+ docker containers. One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). \n Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The \"internal\" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). \n Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. \n My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. \n Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes. Any ideas? \n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/Jyncus  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has an USB-HID connector on the back which is currently connected to my Synology DS216. I set up the UPS via DSM and it seems to be working fine. But now i'd like to connect also my Proxox server. As it seems i have the following options\n Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud\n I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.\n I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my \"server\".\n What do you think?

I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.\n I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.\n I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:\n  \nMedia Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.\n An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.\n If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.\n Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)\n  \nIt does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Kayfabe10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not sure what to call it, but something to keep track of who gave us what so that we can send out thank-yous\n Simple website to display travel instructions, FAQs, etc\n Photo Uploader - An app or website where guests can upload photos to a shared folder that we can access. I might set up another instance of nextcloud with anonymous uploads just for this, unless there is something better?\n Photo Gallery - For after the wedding if we want to share photos.\n \nContacts updater - For people who we don't have contact info for, we'd send them a link to some sort of form for them to provide their mailing address. Worst case we can probably use google forms for this.\n  \nI have a few ideas for some of these things, but would appreciate any ideas everyone has!

          "description": "I have a jam-band lover on my holiday gift-giving list, and I'm thinking of doing a substantial download (~4TB) from bt.etree.org over the next couple months, and giving it to him on some easy-to-use device. The simplest would just be HDD, but I don't think he actually has any type of local media server (like not even iTunes on a PC). So, my question is:\n Is there something like a vendor NAS OS that would:\n  \nProvide an SMB service so he can connect the music to Sonos\n Possibly host Jellyfin/Plex/ other audio-specific media server\n Give him access to a BT client so he can continue to grow his library\n Keep itself reasonable up-to-date and secure\n  \nI'm familiar with a DIY solution, but this needs to be more of an appliance than a hobby unto itself. Part of the gift would be opening the door to the contemporary bittorrent version of the 'taper/trader' jam band scene.\n Any tips would be awesome, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ashooner  \n [link]   [comments]",

At work we have a lab that was setup before I started and they manually install vsphere/k8s(rancher) with out of tree management. This allows for spinning up VMs to be used as part of the cluster from rancher.\n However I noticed that rancher is spun up in a k8s cluster that is formed insider a docker container.\n IE docker-run->k8s cluster generated->rancher installed. This is a one liner from rancher for development testing. Then we have downstream clusters spun up inside vsphere via ranchers GUI.\n The reason for all this is \"Cloud Agnostic\", so we're not using a managed k8s service AKS/EKS etc.\n Anyway I was setting up a new home lab before I had an old r710 server with proxmox and did a lot of manual configuration, vm creation not fun.\n My new setup is 3 dell thin clients with proxmox all joined to a DC. Now aside from manually installing proxmox which I could've automated with PXE boot *I plan on testing PXE boot deploys now that I have proxmox setup*. I'd prefer not to be manually spinning up containers I know portainer is a popular tool for this but I'm considering a k8s enviroment. \n What's your go to method for bootstrapping k8s? I know k8s is overkill for self-hosted but it's what's used at work so I'd like to make it more part of my daily.\n    submitted by    /u/sorieus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I stopped hosting in 2015 because I moved to a location with no broadband internet and the best solution I had was a tethered cell phone with terrible speed and CGNAT. Now I have T-mobile unlimited home internet with 130-230 down and 20-35 up. So I have the speed for it, but still no port forwarding.\n Now here are the solutions and resources research has pointed out to me. Just curious which of them are better choices in current times. I will be hosting multiple VM's/containers including plex to a few users for music and occasional video. Also hosting cloud storage for a few cell phones to store photos and videos for freeing up local storage on devices. And home assistant which I currently pay the cloud fee for and that cost can go towards a more global solution\n ngrok - already using the free one of this for plex which is great. Wish the paid version was priced down a little more, but still open to it.\n cloudflare - looks very popular and similar to ngrok and priced similar.\n localXpose - have not tried but looks similar to ngrok, but more affordable.\n portmap io - looks to be like the above but uses openvpn to which I could setup on my router directly.\n openvpn to a friend/family router to use there ipv4 port forwarding and free DDNS - This is probably what I would have done years ago before the tunneling solutions above became mainstream. Honestly still open to this too though.\n VPS with VPN - have only lightly researched this one. Was going to test on my free AWS account, but read that it gets expensive if much data is uses across AWS, so would need a cheaper host.\n unknown - A wiser choice I am overlooking?\n    submitted by    /u/dominatorstang  \n [link]   [comments]",

The plugin was recently archived on Github, but I tried the same version from the most recent release along with the version of Mattermost that would have been the most recent at the time, and I am having the same problem as the person does in this Issue thread (The heading of the voice channel area appears, but the actual channels do not populate).\n I am running Debian 10 on Digital Ocean, and PostgreSQL (I didn't think the db mattered, but I had never heard of that, and I only used it because I was following along someone else's instructions and they used it, so I thought I'd mention that).\n https://i.imgur.com/3XleCd1.png\n The solution that worked for the issue I posted above was that they had to add the listen port into the setting for the site URL. I opened this port, and I tried all combinations of versions of the Mattermost client + plugin, with and without this port in the URL, HTTP and HTTPS, and I am losing my mind not knowing what else to try. I am very new to Linux and very new to server configurations, so I just don't even know where to begin troubleshooting. Only now as I type this I realize that I never tried to downgrade the server, which could work.... If anyone has any tips on doing this with as little damage as possible, I would love the words of advice. \n Also, the log file does not appear to have anything terribly helpful or out of place. It all looks to be loading the modules as normal with no issues. There are a ton of log files in my Mattermost folder, if there is a specific one I should focus on for this and look more closely at, please share.\n Or if anything jumps out at you that I could try before I downgrade the server, that would be great as well.\n    submitted by    /u/pensivetomatillo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been thinking of migrating Plex to this RHEL9 rig. What are the pros and cons of running Plex on Linux as a native RPM package vs a podman container? Some people report trouble getting NVIDIA hardware acceleration to work with Podman, but looking at various instructions it doesn't seem THAT hard (although obviously a fair bit more involved than just having NVIDIA drivers installed).\n What about the required NVIDIA container runtime, does it essentially replace the runtime provided by Podman or does it only affect containers specifically utilizing NVIDIA hardware? How well supported things are, is it safe to just have the system automatically update all OS updates + NVIDIA drivers (DKMS) + NVIDIA container-related packages?\n    submitted by    /u/-quakeguy-  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I decided to fork Guide2go and add the features that, I believe, were missing.\n So far, I added:\n — The EPG guide includes a Live/New icon for premiere shows and movies. Guide2Go does this natively, however, players like Titivate won't read XML tags. This solves that problem.\n — Added an EPG server. Now, Guide2Go will grab images from SD and act as a server for those images; it will download the images and cache them locally to avoid kill calling SD API. This is very useful for clients like Plex or Emby. Very similar to what 123EPG does (Actually, not similar, but the same feature).\n — Added the option to not download the images locally, but to call SD API every time a client needs an image. This is useful if you only have one or two clients with few EPG days downloaded. If you have many channels, this will not work for you. SD has a limit in the number of images that can be downloaded directly.\n ​\n I accept constructive criticism in the Code, I am not a developer by any means.

If I create a 'Trash' folder by mounting a new share from my NAS GUI, then it resolves the 500 internal area.

We do many things including computer repair(even board level repair), software troubleshooting, etc. While we have a fair number of residential customers, we've also got a number of commercial clients for whom we do not only the aforementioned, but also managed backups. A typical client setup would be a Synology Diskstation to match their needs along with a Synology C2 cloud account. We have their workstations use Synology's 'Active Backup for Business' which will backup workstations on our schedule with whichever backup scheme we set up. The NAS itself will use Synology's 'Hyper Backup' to then back itself up to the Synology C2 cloud storage - whew... that's a lot of Synology stuff, and I rather dislike that.\n I'd rather have something less monolithic in the event Synology changes something down the road(for example pricing), forcing me to change gears. Given the above use case, what would be your go-to setup?\n Follow-up question: In my office, I too use a Synology DS, and with that I also use the Synology Office productivity suite which I would describe as 'decent, but no Google Docs'.

I also searched using HaProxy on pfsense to balance between the servers and then traefik to handle the subdomains after that but only found one thing and it was to not do it. I also looked into cloudflare tunnels but seems like it’s not really ideal. I’m not doing anything media streaming with the domain so would that still be an option?\n Is this even possible? Where can I find a guide in order to set it up if it is? I just want to be able to have more specific domains than anything. Don’t want to mix a family domain with something a client may type in.

I love the dummies guides (check them out here) I have multiple of them myself and I love the style of them. Plain in language and simple to follow.\n Now the first one i've written assumes you have basic linux skills (creating files etc) but I am working on a docker & portainer guide soon along with a few others in the basics range.\n Today I'd like to launch with Matrix and Element.\n https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/002-matrix/\n I welcome any feedback and also looking for contributors too who are interested as I am in writing really simple guides for anyone and everyone.\n My list so far being made (some are already in draft)\n  \nAuthentik\n Nginx Proxy Manager\n *arr groups\n Portainer\n Hugo + Umami\n Actual\n Invidious\n Vaultwarden & Bitwarden\n  \nI am also planning to have some business focused ones so stay tuned for those.\n Thank you all for a great community, truly be enjoyable part of my day hearing new to the hobby making great things.\n    submitted by    /u/QuantumNow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/selfhosted, I just wanted to gather some opinions regarding removing Nextcloud from my home server and replacing it with a few other services. The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.\n I've been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:\n - SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV's transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn't deal very well with large files, but I'm not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.\n - Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.\n - Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64. \n The goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server. Does that make any sense or is that an overly elaborate solution that will not provide any real improvement?\n    submitted by    /u/avnoui  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I was wondering if there was a way where as soon as my phone connects to my home network, it triggers my Mac to backup my iPhone over the network and have it store the backup files on my server. Is then even possible? Is there a docker container that can emulate a networked Mac with iTunes for me? Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I couldn’t find anything on google.\n    submitted by    /u/intel-gma-950  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then after like 5 upgrades in, I kept getting a different error about my db not being connected even though it was running and listening so I just ended up rolling back to before I started doing upgrades. Great waste of time. \n I dont care for all the apps. I dont need a cms. Im the only one who uses the instance so a chat feature doesnt do too much for me.\n The only functionality I care about is cloud storage for my photos and videos and privileged account access. I like how theres an android app. I like how the android app has auto upload. I like having a web UI. I like having a trash can in case I want to restore something I deleted. \n The last ~4 days I've been having issues with the android app crashing and I tried to upgrade my NC since Im on V22 but got all kinds of errors and had to rollback. \n The other day I downloaded a different app called fireshare. I love the UI there and I love how snappy and responsive and quick it is. I uploaded an 80mb video to it while I was testign it out and the video buffered instantly. No stuttering. The same video on NC would play for 10 seconds then pause and buffer and the whole app will freeze up when I try to click play. \n If someone took whatever engine is running that and repurposed it for cloud photo and video storage + android auto syncing then it would be perfect.\n I see a lot of people complain about nextcloud on this subreddit all the time.

          "description": "Some more context: I have an external USB hard drive connected to my home server (an old laptop). On most days, the drive is only active for short bursts (either media consumption or nightly borg backups). I assume this kind of usage pattern is very common in the community.\n I've noticed that the drive never spins down by default and makes quite a bit of noise, which prompted me to look into hard drive spin down with utilities such as hdparm (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/hdparm). In my case, I changed the APM (Advanced Power Management) setting from its default value of 128 to 64 which reliably spins the drive down shortly after the burst of activity (as verified by ear and smartctl -i -n standby /dev/sdX). Great – less noise, heat, and (hopefully) power consumption! Now my question is the following:\n Do you let your idle hard drives spin down? Does spin down actually increase the longevity of the drive (with a similar usage pattern)?\n I'd be super happy to hear what other self-hosters do and if you could point me to a reliable resource for further reading.

Could swear I remember seeing a post within the last 6 months with recommendations other than Moodle but maybe I was dreaming as I can't find it anymore.\n So, Moodle doesn't seem to list some actual features that I am interested in (okay well it does but not all of them, or maybe it's assumed I already know). I already have Plex btw, and I really don't want to use that for online learning course material.\n The features I am looking for, in something kind of light weight are:\n - Multi user support\n - Video support (I have videos on a NAS, if I serve up an NFS directory, can I sort those videos on the LMS into the correct courses - like Plex, let me make a library)\n - File upload for course materials and PDFs etc - if PDF could be rendered in browser that'd be pretty sweet\n - But not only video streaming in a browser, but also audio stream too\n - Course completion meter and tracking (like, I've done 50% of the course etc)\n - Course tagging\n Thanks everyone! :)\n    submitted by    /u/zirophyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem is, the specs aren't the best and if I don't get a RAM upgrade a VM for every service isn't gonna be an option. I want to isolate them as much as possible for security purposes though. I also want the experience of setting everything up by myself, not just download a Docker image and install it, as I think that's the most fun part. What should I do? I'm currently running a proxmox and my vyos router VM on it and I thought about adding qbittorrent and nextcloud, although I will probably hit my 8GB RAM limit soon. So, what should I do?\n    submitted by    /u/alinastraz  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I port forward the port, I do get connectable (as per the connection status symbol).\n But now my other port forwarding rules, 80 and 443 which my reverse proxy uses are having connection issues. Often when trying to remotely access my services using port 443, I get time out issues and connection is not possible. This will always start working again just as I remove the qbittorent port forward rule in my router settings.\n Seems I can only have one of these services' ports open at the time, and never at the same time. Both services are on same device, and on the same docker network. My router port forwarding rules point to my server and the correct IP. No other service is using the torrent listening port. Any tips?\n If anyone stumbles upon this later. The fix was to disable the \"dos protection\" feature on my Asus router. I think the amount of udp requests created from making my torrents connectable triggered the alert on a possible dos attack. Lol.\n    submitted by    /u/Filigott  \n [link]   [comments]",

My job is called \"Site Reliability Engineering\", some folks call it \"DevOps\". \n Two years ago, during lockdown, I started making \"DevOps From Scratch\" videos to help beginners get into the field of DevOps. At that time, I was interviewing lots of candidates and many of them lacked fundamentals due to most of them focusing on these new technologies like \"Cloud\", \"kubernetes\" etc., so I was mostly focusing on those fundamentals with these videos, and how everything fits together. \n I realize that this will be helpful to at least some new folks around here. If you are an absolute beginner, of course I would recommend you watch from the beginning, but feel free to look around and find something you are interested in. I have many videos dealing with basics of Linux, managing domains, SSL, Nginx reverse proxy, WordPress etc to name a few.\n Here is the landing page : https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/\n Direct link to the Youtube Playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxYCgfC5WpnsAg5LddfjlidAHJNqRUN14\n ​\n Please note that I did not make this to make any money and I have no prior experience making youtube videos or talking to a public channel, and English is not my native language. So, please excuse the quality of the initial videos (I believe I improved a bit in the later videos though :) ) \n Note: If you see any ads in the video, I did not enable it, it's probably YouTube forcing it on the videos, I encourage you to use an adblocker to watch these videos.\n    submitted by    /u/m4nz  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you create a booking page on Cal.com, other people can use the page to make an appointment with you, and a new event will be added to a CalDAV calendar you specify. In fact, Cal.com can integrate with multiple calendars to help you let people book appointments while avoiding conflicts. Handy!\n However, there are some calendars I would like Cal.com to use for conflict avoidance that are published as .ics URLs only. And right now Cal.com can't subscribe to .ics feeds.\n My first attempt was to use my Nextcloud instance to subscribe to the .ics feed, then have Cal.com access my Nextcloud calendars via CalDAV. Unfortunately, Cal.com can only see CalDAV calendars that live directly in my Nextcloud instead of the .ics feed it subscribes to.\n Is there another intermediary CalDAV server that can subscribe to .ics feeds and exposes them as a read-only CalDAV calendars so that Cal.com can see them? Of course, the CalDAV server needs to refresh the .ics subscriptions frequently to reflect the latest updates.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/avamk  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan is to pay for a cheap VPS, and have my home server establish a tunnel to this, and let the VPS forward all traffic through the tunnel to my home server.\n At first, it seemed like a reverse SSH tunnel was what I was looking for. But reading up on it, SSH tunnels only seem to support TCP. While I found some workarounds this seems to complicate things unnecessarily.\n After some more research I found rathole which seems to do exactly what I need.\n Does anyone have any experience with this?\n Ideally I would like to use rathole to forward traffic from the VPS to my home server in order to establish a VPN connection through wireguard.\n This seems to be the right tool for the job.

This motivates us to localize and tailor the sign-in process even more.\n Now, we're ecstatic to announce that Logto Sign-in Experience has full support for i18n, which means your products can reach a wider global audience and offer more personalized and contextualized options for all users.\n  \nWe have 6 predefined languages to choose from, all of which were created by our international community and can be modified to your liking.\n \nSupport for up to 113 language tags, allowing you to use your own translation in order to reach the vast majority of countries worldwide.\n \n The admin console already includes this functionality. The \"Language\" section in \"Others\" tab of the Sign-in Experience page is where you'll be able to rapidly set up and manage your keys and custom values.\n CLI: Exclusively for Logto\n Combating with complicated commands? That's not how we roll. So we're bringing some friendly little things to keep the elegance going even in the command line.\n If you're trying to install Logto on your machine, skip the long, scary install command. It now reads:\n bash npm init @logto \n And you are all set. Check out Using CLI for a detailed explanation of how to use Logto CLI.\n    submitted by    /u/Formal_Tree2535  \n [link]   [comments]",

The server could host the keepass db or other files. Downside, after, let's say a flooding, it might takes weeks before I would care about accessing my servers again. There is a chance that I'll even forget the combination.\n Public cloud, gdrive, more or less similar to gist / pastebin.\n Hosting the keepass db files itself, seems to insecure to me, even if my passphrase has 30 characters. Someone could just download it and use high powered brute force to crack it.\n Another idea would be a second keepass db on a public cloud, with a private ssh key and only hints, that would help me remember, but not give anything away.\n    submitted by    /u/Mean_Einstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

The sorting of these is a work-in-progress after a massive scanning session, and now the documents are sitting in a network share. Some are nicely named and live in a sensible folder structure, and a lot aren't - at least for the moment.\n I had considered using Paperless-ngx as a way to use automated tagging and OCR to make searching for things easier in the future. However, I believe that Paperless-ngx works by consuming documents within an 'import' directory, and from that point on the document will live within the docker container. This doesn't seem great to me as I'd rather have full control of the document locations.\n Am I correct in my thinking? I was wondering if there's a document system that works similar to how PhotoPrism works: point it at a directory and let it chew over everything there, writing tags and other information to its own database while leaving the original files untouched.\n ​\n Thanks in advance for any wisdom shared.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatAGoodDoggy  \n [link]   [comments]",

You only have to login to authentik once, and then just grant the applications access when you login to them. \n LDAP should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't have 2fa and is quite an old protocol, so I suggest using it only when an app doesn't support other options. \n Proxy auth also displays the login portal, but it works on the reverse proxy level, so reverse proxy forwards requests to authentik, which makes sure the user is authenticated. Authentik then forwards the requests to the app, with a special header with the username. This option is best for static/single page/single-user apps, but not ideal for most of them as it will break mobile apps and some APIs due to it's low level nature. Some apps have explicit support for proxy auth and work just as well with it as some do with OpenID. \n Authentik docs have per-app instructions which show the recommended way to set it up.\n    submitted by    /u/dada513  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm interested to hear what kind of security and monitoring measures you all use for your servers and the services that you're self-hosting.\n My approach isn't very extensive so I'm looking for areas where I could make some improvements. So far it's:\n  \nTighten SSH \n Use SSH keys for authentication\n Disable root login\n Change the default port for SSH connections\n Tweak some of the miscellaneous settings in sshd_config\n \n Use fail2ban\n Use Cloudflare (DDoS protection features, caching reduces load on origin server, hide origin server for DNS entries)\n Deploy apps dockerised when possible\n Use NGINX as my web server/reverse proxy \n Force HTTPS connections\n Use NGINX authentication for services\n \n Use a password manager to generate strong credentials for every service/account.\n  \nSome things which I'm looking to add in the future are:\n  \nA backup solution for logs and other important files, on a daily basis\n An extra layer of authentication via Authelia or something similar\n Remote access for sensitive apps via a Wireguard tunnel (though this isn't something I need, at least for now)\n Find some kind of monitoring solution for app and server logs\n Find a Intrusion Detection System to use but I don't know if this is overkill?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/omermikhailk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a WireGuard VPN, Nextcloud and a 3D Printer with web frontend set up and I would (ideally) like access to all under one domain, even from outside the local network. I already have a DynDNS provider set up, so the WireGuard traffic is routed consistently even with changing public IPs. However, I can not directly access for example nextcloud under that domain, since only my custom WireGuard port is exposed.\n Currently, I do have access to everything even from the outside, but I have to type the IPs in the VPN of the respective server to access it.

I've decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I'm having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.\n Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver's docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:\n version: \"3\" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 \n I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let's Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:\n Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server's IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes \n When creating a new SSL certificate:\n - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains \n All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed\n The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I've set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I'm unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I'm completely out of ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/Sigma-Alpha_2  \n [link]   [comments]",

As many are complaining about these USB docks buying an old 1U disk rack on eBay. There’s so many options on eBay that I need someone kind enough to point me on the right product. Obviously there’s no 1U disk rack which can be connected via USB so it will be Ethernet and as far as I understood these have a CPU which means a OS so are file servers (correct me if I’m wrong).

The font wasn't working and it came with this ugly serif font instead, however weirdly enough it displayed the font when Portainer wasn't accessed behind my reverse proxy\n With lots of googling I've managed to fix it to allow the font to load behind the reverse proxy!\n In your nginx reverse proxy security config under \"add_header Content-Security-Policy\", add the following \"font-src * data: blob 'unsafe-inline';\"\n For me, because I use OpenMediaVault this config file was located under /etc/nginx/openmediavault-webgui.d/security.conf, however varying on your setup you might find the CSP line in another file!\n Just thought I'd make this post in case anyone else ran into this issue, as I couldn't find anything similar on reddit quickly & easily.

In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.\n I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.\n I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.\n So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?\n I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.\n Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?\n The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don't have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI's or something like that.\n    submitted by    /u/SmoothLiquidation  \n [link]   [comments]",

Concurrent access of all users is very unlikely. at most 5-10 people will use the services regularily at any given time\n Nothing's set in stone so far except for software. Drive space requirement > 500GB\n I'd like to use \n  \nOpenProject (used on a Synology DS via Docker before) for project management and scheduling of tasks\n \nNextcloud for file sharing (integrated in OP)\n \nsynapse / matrix to channel user available chat apps on one single platform.\n \n I have three options for hardware:\n  \nSynology DS with an Atom C3853, 32GB ECC RAM (but slow internet access)\n \nIntel NUC with Celeron J4005, 4GB of DDR4 (can be upgraded to 8GB and relocated for faster internet access)\n \nor investing ~400$ in a new Odroid H3 / H3+ , 16GB RAM and 2 SSDs for RAID 1 (moved somewhere else for fast internet)\n \n All services must run through a VPN tunnel, so a VPN server would have to be hosted on the machine, too.\n  \nThe cheapest and easiest solution is def using the NUC but I am not sure whether the J4005 can manage at least those 3 services within docker / portainer.\n \nThe Synology has a faster CPU and tons of RAM and HDD space but cannot be relocated somewhere else for faster internet.\n \nThe Odroid H3 / H3+ has by far the best CPU and offers M.2 and 2x SATA for internal Raid 1 but means a bigger investment.\n \n What would you recommend and why?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/mironicalValue  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing is, if it could run Plex in good condition as how it’s now, or should I install some older version of Windows, or even should I install another dedicated server OS to run my media stuff (video and music) and maybe as a file backup too, but hopefully with an easy remote access tool. Plex is really flexible and simple because I can play my stuff on my chromcast and managing in the web app too.\n So that’s the question, should I keep the windows 10 version and install Plex server, or should I use other OS and/or Media server APP?.\n Thanks in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/Puchacamilo  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only difference is that what should be public is on public dns (cloudflare) and what should not be accessible from internet, is on my lan dns (Adguard in my case). And traefik having dns challenge wildcard certs for my domain. \n But what happens when someone finds out my public IP, and adds to their host file my ip and my(or try random) \"private\" dns record. Will it request from traefik my supposedly private url/page but from public internet? Since traefik servers those subdomains and it doesn't care where request came from? I have even seen you can request a specific IP while requesting dns name with curl too. \n So from security point of view, is it possible to access your apparently \"private\" dns records using this method ? \n If yes, what is the best practice to separate public/private records under same public domain ? Use two traefik instances, or I have been looking for source IP restrictions for those private/lan requests ?\n  \n​\n Unfortunately haven't got much responses at r/Traefik, let's see what you think :)\n    submitted by    /u/Koto137  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had this working before so I have no idea why its not working now, but here's my situation:\n I just upgraded my server and would like to try Nextcloud again as it was pretty clunky before. I'm running Unraid, and I install Nextcloud (it doesn't matter which container, its all of them this happens with) with its own IP address (also tried on host net).\n I configured a HAProxy backend/frontend entry, same way I always do like the 30 other services I have, and the same way I did before when Nextcloud worked with HAProxy. Then, I have Pi-Hole running as my main DNS, so I enter my domain \"nextcloud.example.com\" in there and point it at HAProxy's virtual IP, same as the other 30 entries.\n When attempting to visit the address \"https://nextcloud.example.com\" I receive the following error: 503 Service Unavailable | The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port\n I have tried directing HAProxy backend entry to both the HTTP and HTTPS ports and tried with SSL on and off, still receive this same message. Happens with every. single. Nextcloud docker container. I have not had this issue before, and the last time I played around with Nextcloud before the upgrade was about 6-9 months ago.\n Can anyone advise what I might be doing wrong? What I might be able to change? Or, if I am asking in the wrong place where I might be able to go to request assistance for this?\n Thank you in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/cr0wstuf  \n [link]   [comments]",

If she does, it changes the market for the account and the account then thinks everyone else is in the wrong location. \n So what I want to do is setup a proxy or VPN on my network and point her firestick to it from her network. \n Obviously my main concern is security.

          "description": "I have a friend whose college network blocks certain connections, such as SSH or anything custom that uses SSL. I know enough to know that if I re-host the same service at the same port with no SSL, it works. This makes no sense to me, but does make me feel pretty uneasy since one of the things we use is a self-hosted voice/text chat server.\n I've been getting into self-hosting a bit and have looked at stuff like Pivpn for myself. But before I go experimenting and taking up this person's college time, I'm wondering if anyone has ideas for things that would be most likely to defeat this. I know that given the original problem, it's possible that some or all VPN protocols might not work. I haven't tried simply hosting the service on port 443, so I don't know if they're doing something special to monitor traffic. We did find that a particular text-based rmote access protocol is functioning fine, but various other secure connections are blocked. All of the above are using TCP and SSL. I have no idea what the firewall is doing here, but I'm unhappy that it's forcing us to send things back and forth in the clear, so if I can fix it, I'd like to do so.\n    submitted by    /u/EinsteinVonBrainless  \n [link]   [comments]",

Which works great but it’s not a one stop shop for removing into our infra.\n I would ideally want to get rid of the vpn and instead have some kind of broker. \n Anyone I’ve missed? I’m sure a lot have happened during the pandemic /work from home revolution.\n Also, I’m pretty sure we have not optimised our infrastructure sufficiently enough for remote sessions to be at its best.

          "description": "I want to create a VPN to connect my two remote devices (say A - Server, B - Client). Explored Tailscale and other services, but I wanted a server with the control over keys and config. This article helped me to setup a hub-spoke VPN with the hub on a VPS. But it had few concerns regarding security. Let's say my VPS provider or an intruder, say X, manages to gain access to the server. Possible impact :\n  \nX can impersonate as a peer. All he has to do is switch Endpoint A's public key with his key and restart wg and he'll start receiving packets from an unsuspected client B.\n X can view the unencrypted packets as the hub has to decrypt and re-encrypt before forwarding packets between the spokes.\n  \nI was searching for some way in which these can be solved and I saw this article from the same person. To sum it up, there are two layers of tunnels, one hub-spoke as explained above, and another inner layer just between the two spokes through the outer layer. This kind of makes it a virtual point-point topology setup for the inner layer which adds its own layer of encryption. So with firewall properly setup in the peers, now if X manages to gain access:\n  \nX can impersonate as a peer in the outer layer, but his packets will not reach my peer's inner layer as the private & public keys of inner layer is never known to the hub(VPS). So effectively the incoming connection is rejected by wireguard (on wg port) and firewall (on other ports).\n X can view unencrypted packets coming from outer layer. But there is one more layer of encryption in the inner layer which makes it effectively E2E.\n  \nI believe setting up a hub-spoke this way will be safe and private on any VPS as long as the wireguard cryptography isn't broken.

It's called Assetgrid and it's a personal finance management tool.\n Github repo: https://github.com/assetgrid/assetgridapp\n Website: https://assetgrid.app\n Screenshots: https://assetgrid.app/screenshots\n What can Assetgrid do at the moment?\n At the moment Assetgrid is a bit basic, but still useful, which is why I'm sharing it. It has a powerful CSV importer, simple transaction categorization and it can display your spending in categories and your cash flow and balance over time.\n It also has a powerful query engine and allows bulk editing, so you can quickly categorize your transactions based on simple criteria. If you want a quick overview of your personal finances, give it a try.\n In the future I have bigger plans.\n The vision / long term aims for the project\n I created Assetgrid because I felt that most self-hosted personal finance tools were very tuned for a single task. Most commonly budgets. That allows for very easy to use and intuitive software, but I just personally needed something more. I'd have one tool to keep track of receipts, another for budgets, a third for loans and investments and I'd be entering the same information into each tool. I think it just makes sense to collect it all in one place.\n In the near future I will add automation, so you can automatically process imported transactions. I will also add a metadata that allows you to attach any kind of information like file attachments, relations and notes to your data. Once I'm satisfied with the import/processing aspect I will begin working on budgets, bills, currencies and non-cash assets. I have spent a lot of time considering how the various features should play together and I have some ideas for how to integrate the features in an efficient workflow that doesn't get in your way and only presents you to the subset of features you use.\n    submitted by    /u/Floedekartofler  \n [link]   [comments]",

The box has 2.5 Gbit ethernet and can even be used with the NVMe to ethernet net card.\n This makes for a really awesome low power server and should even be a really capable OPNsense box with that net card. The case options also look amazing, small and simple yet flexible. Having only two SATA ports might be a bit limiting for data horders but then again it's easy to add more via USB anyway.\n I'm really liking what I see there.

          "description": "I am a complete beginner that is learning how to make a website for fun through a VPS. However, I'm just worried a bit about security and was wondering if someone can ease my anxiety a bit. Here are my questions (with some context included):\n  \nMost of my stuff is written in HTML and CSS, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake by making each page a .php file instead of .html. The only thing I have written in PHP is a form that sends messages to my Discord server via webhooks, but that's it. Can someone possibly take advantage of this?\n The thing is, I did some research today and realized that I should probably avoid PHP/SQL for now in case someone takes advantage of my mistakes. I wanted to make a dynamic website at first, but I realized that I should probably stick with a static website considering how new I am at this.\n I've been connecting to my VPS from my laptop using WinSCP (SFTP). If my server were to get hacked, would it even be remotely possible for them to compromise my laptop? I've been using it to edit my files.\n  \nP.S. I disabled logins via passwords and use a private key. I added Fail2Ban as well. I'm sorry if anyone gets annoyed with my questions, considering I am a complete newbie at this. I'm open to taking safer alternatives in case I'm making really bad mistakes. Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/InternationalBee513  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am using a Pi400 and some Docker containers to run the software I use to fill the server (*arrs, download client, etc.).\n I would like to use Unmanic to do what it does and transcode the media files as they come in. I have it set up in its own container, and it seems to be running fine. However, it is DEAD slow when transcoding, which is—you know—the thing I need it to do.\n My assumption is that using the Pi400 as a transcoding device is unreasonable. Not enough umph. Is this correct? Is there something I can do to make this work? Installing Unmanic on the NAS itself would be ideal, but I cannot do it because, well, the Synology DS418 has some limitations.\n Is there a better way to go about this? Should I just start looking for a cheap GPU to create a dedicated transcoding box?\n Thanks for taking the time to read this.

I'm implementing the backups for my services (on VPS), they are running on Docker, and most of them has a \"direct\" volume to the project folder (not use docker volumes per se).\n Considering that these services are used only by me, there are any problem to execute Rsync without stopping the container before? For now, I'm running the backup script at 3am, so at this hour there is no activity on the services.\n Thanks in advance! Regards!\n    submitted by    /u/netyaco  \n [link]   [comments]",

Does this bring extra security or is it just a duplication of effort?\n Bonus question: I also have a Unifi UDMP which does IDS / IPS at the gateway, should I just continue to use this instead (the functionality is more basic I think and doesn't really do much wrt to reporting), run both, or switch it off?\n    submitted by    /u/markhaines  \n [link]   [comments]",

Phenomenally, at the other end of things, we have the latest cards from AMD and Nvidia that can do fast transcoding but they are all 100W+ behemoths. In fact, a quick survey leads me to believe that all of the <75w GPUs available today are 5+ years old which means they have old encode/decode technology. \n My assumption is that the market for low power transcoding has gone to Intel quicksync. \n I've recently been setting up a Dell PowerEdge to handle a number of different functions including, I had hoped, some occasional on-the-fly transcoding. Then I had to slap my forehead when I realized that the Dell server firmware doesn't support any igpu functionality - so no Intel QS for this machine. I would have to add a separate video card if I want hardware encoding. But there aren't any attractive options that I can find.\n    submitted by    /u/chmedly020  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specs are overkill but I'd rather build a NAS / Home Server than buy a 4bay Synology for £500+ for easier expansion in the future.\n I'm just wondering if anybody has experience running a similar setup, and want kinda power draw you're pulling (idle or under load) and just how expensive is it to run something like that?\n Girlfriend won't be impressed if I hike up the power bill too much no matter how much she likes Plex!\n If it helps,.

          "description": "I Currently repurposed an i7 5820k with 64GB ram and a GTX970(Probably gonna take it out) into a freenas server to fill with 16TB HDDs as storage for Plex and to play with dockers. I already have a VMware esxi server on a Dell r720 and a Plex server with 28TB on a old i5 6600K running all the ARRs as well (thinking of moving these to Docker, right now they're local installs). I had a 240gb and a 1TB SSD laying around. I installed Truenas on the 240gb. I noticed that I can't do anything with the excess space. So I wonder if is there a better way to run it. I hate wasting space I have several 1TB 2.5 SSDs laying around from various projects over the years I thought about buying a SATA card to run them off of too and use the 240 as a cache drive for the mechanicals. \n What would be the best most efficient way to use TrueNAS? Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way? Bonus if you know a good place in the US to buy reliable used big storage HDD for cheap? I'd love to purchase some.\n    submitted by    /u/megatron36  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.\n With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.\n What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).\n Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.\n Thanks All!\n    submitted by    /u/Lxr200  \n [link]   [comments]",

I already have my main client PC connected 10GbE via peer-to-peer ( its been working perfectly fine for over 3 years). I also have a Macbook Pro connected via 10GbE.\n Now I'm in the middle of too many lights at night lighting up since is in my bedroom, honestly I can not handle this anymore. I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.\n My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.\n From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.\n I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:\n MikroTik\n QNAP\n I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).\n    submitted by    /u/giorivpad  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.\n Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.\n The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.\n Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).\n My question:\n  \nJust how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.\n \nAre there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)\n \nAny other potential issues?\n \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

A pack of 200 Klein VDV826-763 pass-trough connectors are $55 on Amazon, which is definitely more expensive than your average RJ45 connector. I have never used pass-through connectors, but they do seem easier to use. Is it worth the extra cost switching to pass-through?\n    submitted by    /u/adzam5  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.\n I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.\n I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?\n In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk). This makes backing up data easier to manage, also some disks/volumes/containers I want to encrypt.\n Can someone point me in the right direction?\n    submitted by    /u/wulf_rtpo6338  \n [link]   [comments]",

After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.\n I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?\n Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)\n    submitted by    /u/BigWillyHaverer  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve gotten the okay to turn the downstairs closet into a server/electronics room. \n I plan on putting a rack in there, along with my TV tuner for the house, and whatever equipment our new ISP provides us with. \n The room is a pretty standard laundry closet - you could fit a stacked washer and dryer in there - has a 240V outlet and a 120V outlet. The water supply has been capped and cut off. And there is a vent that goes outside. \n Does anybody have any sort of guidance for this setup?

Instantly it jumps to 900+. (Close enough to 1000 that given devices using network bandwidth, all other reasons why you might not get the full speed your ISP promises, and whatever else that I'm happy to say 900-950 is close enough to 1000 for me.). I've used the same cable, from the same port on the ISP modem ( an xb7, I think this one is a technicolor, but I've had comscope ones and there was no change.).\n Modem port is good. Cables are good.

          "description": "I'm looking for good hardware that I can have as a 'go to' recommendation if anyone asks me about setting up a 'server' and keep in mind the people that would be asking about setting up a server aren't going to be tech-savvy, they just want to buy something, throw it on a shelf and 'hopefully' have it work.\n I'm thinking either a NUC or mac mini.\n I know there are people that only have mac products which is why I mention the mac mini, they may not want to add a NUC (likely with a windows OS) into their environment.\n Here is my concern. In any scenario where there is a media server, the idea/goal is to get the content to direct play on the client side. Typically the client devices are an nvidia shield or an apple TV and 95% of the time I'd say those devices direct play (they are hard wired). They seem to only switch to transcoding when subtitles are involved or if the audio stream needs to be changed for some reason.\n I'm looking to see which NUC and/or if a mac mini would act as a good server if it ever had to transcode. The last thing I want to do is recommend a 1k server device and have it lock up while transcoding.\n Some additional information\n  \nno remote users, only local play (meaning, the library is not shared and won't have other family/friends streaming/transcoding/etc)\n very rare that more than one stream will be active at a time\n decent amount of UHD content, but being on the LAN (all devices are wired) as long as the client can direct play, I don't see 4k being an issue\n  \nI wasn't sure where else to post this because this is more of a hardware question vs a media server question. For transcoding purposes, am I looking for something with a built in video card or is the CPU more critical? Or both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for something to run a full fledged VM and/or Kubernetes cluster on. I want to be able to run a few 4 core 8GB VMs at a time on a node, so the rPi is out, as are most of the SBC solutions I know of. I'm also not looking to build up a bunch of 3D printed or CNCd cases to put things that were never meant to be in a rack, well, into a rack. So here's some rough critera:\n  \n1U, 2U, or SFF formfactor (Think Project Tiny Mini Micro, small black boxes that can sit two side by side on a 1U rack shelf)\n 16 cores in a node, though preferably more like 32 threads (With or without Hyperthreading)\n Easily upgraded with DDR3 or DDR4 ECC RDIMMs off the shelf. I would like to be able to buy some DIMMs and upgrade the RAM in my existing nodes if I decide I want to expand the lab.\n 10GBE SFP+ built in OR multiple PCIE slots in the chassis to be able to add in my own PCIE cards\n Options to run multiple HDDs (preferably 2.5\" SSDs though even just a pair of m.2 slots would be good enough for a basic node\n Under $1000 for a node, though $200-400 would be even better as I want to buy many of them.\n  \nI'm sure I'm asking too much here, given the promised price, performance, and power consumption that comes with the ARM datacenter revolution, but it would be nice to start deploying ARM at home now that it's a few generations old.\n    submitted by    /u/AsYouAnswered  \n [link]   [comments]",

I suspect the number will be quite low given their numerous downsides such as noise, inefficiency, inflexibility, cost... All for the sake of density which isn't as big of a factor in a homelab. I mean sure, it would be nice if you could double your existing compute power in the same rack, but it's not going to cost you as much as it would cost a datacenter to get another rack.\n I don't hate myself or my neighbors enough to buy or run a normal blade server lol. But if I got to customize one to a ridiculous extent then I'd be interested in a tower style mini rack, sorta like the Dell VRTX. With maybe 4, 8 or even 16 nodes with high core count CPUs running at low clocks to keep the temps and noise reasonable while maintaining high multithreaded throughput, and a GPU to offload some stuff onto...

An i9 9900K, Strix ATX motherboard and 32gb RAM. I've been wanting to create a second server with a higher clock speed for things like dedicating game servers, instead of using Windows VM's within Unraid, due to the Windows processing/RAM overhead.\n Additional things I'll need will be Case, PSU, CPU Cooler. I'll add an existing drive I have.\n My initial thoughts were another 4U case, but I wanted to keep costs down, and I likely will only have 1 drive in it so seems like a big waste of space.\n 3U or 2U cases could work, but I don't know about their height clearance for CPU coolers, and they don't seem that much cheaper. I could even look into cheap cases off aliexpress as I could probably wait (but shipping is crazy $$ to Australia)\n I thought about an old PC tower off marketplace, reuse the PSU, cooler and lie the case on it's side. But not sure about height/width or aesthetics.

Wondering if it would be better to just build a small desktop with a more modern CPU to handle the tasks I have in mind, which are:\n  \nVarious game servers: Minecraft, Terraria, Quake 3, etc.\n Video/Music storage (~20TB)\n Nextcloud\n Jellyfin\n Home security DVR\n Plus a handful of other smaller VMs/containers.\n  \nEnergy costs are pretty cheap where I am so I'm not super concerned about the power draw, and since this will be in my basement noise isn't a factor either.\n What are your thoughts, anybody go with rack mount and hate it? Or go with desktops and find out you didn't have enough space for something?\n    submitted by    /u/Roughneck_76  \n [link]   [comments]",

What is reason for choosing your remote access setup and why is your way more secure than the next guys way.\n My remote access setup! I chose not to use a VPN, I created a domain name, used cloud flare for dns, setup a Ubuntu VM on my proxmox with cloudron image, and use Apache guacamole. Keep in mind I had to use my public IP for DNS, then I forward port 80,443 from my router to my Ubuntu VM.\n Problem, I don’t like the exposure and with cloudron they recommend not updating the image as they push their own security updates to the machine every night. Is this good or bad to rely on someone else to patch any new vulns or is it better that way since I’ll more than likely be late applying any patches.\n I really don’t like having any open ports on my ingress but seems like to remote access any network this needs to happen.\n Questions, comments, SECURITY CONCERNS?\n P.S. thanks in advance, looking forward to all the wisdom\n    submitted by    /u/According_Speed_2081  \n [link]   [comments]",

Redundancy is not needed for my setup. I am hoping someone with the same equipment could help me out with these questions. \n If I put the p420i controller into HBA mode would I then be able to use 4kn drives with ZFS?\n If not, which controller would work best to allow me to maximize my density?

This is depending on what SSD's i can find and to what price.\n The SSDs need Power Loss Protection (else S2D complains and it's a bad time). Other than that, they need pretty high write endurance, especially if I'm using them as cache (at least 3 DWPD or 4 TBW per day according to Microsoft, though I doubt I'll actually manage to come close to this).\n If I can get the 8 bay version of the R620 them 2 bays will be for boot (raid 1). Then depending on the setup either for hybrid: 2 bays for SSD cache and 4 for HDD capacity, or for all flash: 4 for SSD capacity, 2 for scale-up. (This drivecount is the minimum required by Microsoft).\n I've been looking at intel Ark, and the p3700/p3600/p3500 series seem ok, but they are NVMe and I feel that is a waste. Considering the backplanes can have up to SAS 2 speeds (6 gb/s), thousands of mb/s is just unusable potential.\n I also don't have too much money, so those nvme drives are a good bit pricy.\n If anyone has any recs I'll gladly take them!\n    submitted by    /u/MrMrRubic  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm relatively new to IT as I started working helpdesk two years ago, so I'm fairly certain I don't have the know-how to build something entirely from scratch which leaves me feeling stuck and not knowing how to move forward. I've done my research and looked at tutorials and it all really goes over my head. As far as I can tell, there isn't any instant gratification type of solution where you can get a VM with AD and Exchange already built in ready for you to use. There's trial versions you can download, but they eventually expire and I'm not sure how affordable it is to keep paying for it once the trial runs out. For someone in my position, what are the things I should start learning so I can get to the point where I can eventually build a lab on my own, and be able to construct my own environment that mimics a production server?

I read the Intel 11th gen doesn't have a good power consumption.\n 1st option:\n  \nCPU: keep the current Ryzen 3700x\n Motherboard: replace the Asus PRIME x470 PRO with the Asrock B550M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \n2st option:\n  \nCPU: Intel i5-12400F\n Motherboard: Asrock H610M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \nOption 2 will cost me 200 euro more than option 1.\n I read the Intel 12th allows the IGPU passtrough, which might be interesting for plex/jellyfin.\n ​\n Questions:\n  \nDoes the mini-itx board consume less then mATX/ATX?\n Does the B550 chipset more efficent (less consumption) than x470? I read the x570 consumes 10-15w compared with B550, but I didn't find anyting related to x470 vs B550.\n Does it make sense go for option 2 (intel build) considering the difference price of 200 euro?\n  \nPower Supply\n Currently I have a Seasonic Focus GX650 (Gold); the node 202 requires to change the PSU with a SFX PSU. Which is best choice between 300W/450W/650W? Would a \"bronze psu\" a good choice or better stick with a \"gold\" one?\n ​\n Many thanks to everyone!\n    submitted by    /u/layne_jk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I surely want to run: vault warden, calibre web, pihole, filerun, jellyfin, syncthing (with a backup drive) and potentially many more services in docker containers. Besides that I was thinking about setting up proxmox to be able to experiment with different linux distros and setups.\n After watching most of the videos from ServeTheHome and doing a little research I found two models that are available from a trustworthy vendor:\n - Dell Optiplex 7060 Micro i7-8700T 6x2.4GHz 8GB\n - Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro i5-9500T 6x2.2GHz 16GB\n They both have the same price (500 in USD). I want to upgrade the RAM to 64gb anyway and get an NVMe SSD. Which one should I pick? I'm more convinced about the 7060 but I still want to hear an opinion of someone more experienced. Which processor will be better for virtualization with proxmox?\n I'm not completely decided on Optiplex either but it just seems like those machines are more solid and tested than lenovo or hp while being slightly cheaper - might be just my incorrect perception though.\n Any advice or comment is appreciated, I'm still learning how to homelab but it's so fun.

          "description": "I've come to the realization that I have way too much stuff to keep track of in my head. I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.\n I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.\n If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:\n *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.\n I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.\n Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.\n    submitted by    /u/grumpy-systems  \n [link]   [comments]",

There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.\n I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. \n It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.\n Questions:\n  \nWhat are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?\n How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. \n Is there any fan out there that will not show the \"Fan Failed\" message in the console?

My friend will be running either Proxmox or unRAID. \n I have a couple questions before purchasing this card\n  \n What is the max number of drives supported by 1 H200 card? I've read that it's 256 drives but I'd like to double confirm with y'all.\n \n Is there any limitation max drive capacity per HDD? I don't think so but again, looking for this community's help.\n  General question - how is the H200 different from something like an LSI 9211-8i since that card breaks out one SFF-8087 into only 4 SATA drives? here's an example\n  \nPicture of the two SFF-8087 ports on the backplane - https://i.imgur.com/y5Nsbe1.jpg\n Thanks in advance\n    submitted by    /u/nightcrawler2164  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi\n On the beginning I will start with \"Don't try this at home\" :) I've see a lot of questions on redit and truenas forum about using non ecc ram, hdd over USB and stripe pool. That's why I was start to testing all the \"not to do\" stuff. At home I've found an old Dell latitude laptop with i5 and 12 GB ram (extra I add an PWM fan with Ntc sensor for better cooling) , some caddy adapters and now I buy 2 powered USB hub. The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... \n Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. \n Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) \n Just home lab for fun\n    submitted by    /u/VictorSp1987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The new solution.\n Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5\" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.\n So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.\n Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.\n Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.\n    submitted by    /u/knightcrusader  \n [link]   [comments]",

The case was delayed and I just wanted to use the PC, so I went without but now it seems way too cumbersome to strip the motherboard and install it in the case. But I feel that one day, I will sneeze or something and I'll break it. I currently turn it on by using a screwdriver to short the two prongs.\n Anyway, the way things work is that the PC runs a few data-heavy python scripts, then sends the data to another database which then is displayed on my site. \n I want to have the python code and the necessary files on a remote VM that is hosted by another company. I want to be able to access it from anywhere if I have to debug on-the-fly or if my PC eventually breaks. \n I would like to use a vmware horizon solution, but I've been navigating the site for over 30 mins now and can't just find a straight-up price / download. This effort to obscure the price makes me think that whatever the price is, it's too high. \n So, what is a low-cost and easy-to-setup windows VM that I can access remotely? It has to be hosted on a network that isn't my own.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Pale_Awareness_8633  \n [link]   [comments]",

Who here actually uses it as a portfolio for what they know to show to potential employers. I’m still in Highschool (16) and got my first job over the summer working for the IT director of my school. I got to do it with my friend and made really decent money ($15 an hour). And used some of that money to make my Homelab completely overkill for someone my age. I learned some basic web development and created a homepage for my homelab domain (broomfieldhomelab.net) and am thinking of sending it to my IT director to see if it’s applicable to put on a resume for when I get a ‘real’ job after I graduate. Does anyone else here use their lab as a showing point for their skills?\n Edit: grammar\n    submitted by    /u/MaxBroome  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was hoping it was less proprietary inside, but I did not luck out.... ecessa has no hardware info posted, but luckily I figured out its similar to a Lanner Fw 7582, and they have a user manual! It details all the headers on the motherboard thankfully and specifications. \n Box came with pfsense installed, 4gb ddr3 ram, i5 3.0ghz, and a 50gb ssd. Also has an expansion module with 4 additional NIC. Appears to be a pcie x8 interface so maybe in the future I can use a pcie riser and plop a fiber interface in the rear card slot if I ever want to upgrade. \n My plans are to use it for pfblockerng and openvpn for remote access. \n One fun thing I ran into is I want to pull the expansion module, no need for it drawing power, but then it changes the interface numbering (I think) so I can't access the LAN configuration screen of pfsense. I'll have to work on that and make a serial cable for the console port.\n Anyone have much experience with these? Are they decent?\n    submitted by    /u/RSS83  \n [link]   [comments]",

Before the upgrade I've been getting speeds very, very close to 10 Gb/s.\n NAS is Intel S5520HC (dual LGA1366 X5690) with 192 GB of RAM, and the card sits in PCIe 2.0 x8 slot. It's running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n PC is Z170/i7 desktop with 64 GB of RAM, with the card sitting in PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, and Win10 Pro 21H2. I have 25G DAC cable and both ethtool and Windows betwork panel pick up the connection as 25Gb/s. In both cases cards have sufficient airflow, in a form of a 140 mm 2000 rpm fan blowing over all PCIe devices.\n iperf3 -p 1 shows ~8.3 Gb/s, while -p 4, usually slightly lower, 7.9-8.1 Gb/s. File transfer peaks at ~700 MB/s to ramdisk over SMB and ~730 MB/s over NFS (that's from NVMe, of course).\n I don't see particularly high CPU usage on either side.\n I tried enabling RDMA, but it dropped speeds by around 1 Gb/s.\n I must admit this is not an upgrade I have expected. I do understand that my hardware is not exactly compatible (half PCIe connectivity on both platforms), but both 2.0 x8 and 3.0 x4 deliver around 4 GB/s bandwidth to each of the devices, and I do understand that Windows is not exactly the best system for high speed networks, but maybe there is something I can do in this situation that will help with transfer speed?\n    submitted by    /u/Trudar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I picked up a Poweredge R620 and a pair of LSI cards from ebay to upgrade my linux NAS. The first card was running the full Dell RAID firmware so I pulled down the LSI 20.00.07 firmware, flashed it, and after rebooting it sees my individual drives as expected. This card is still dropping alerts on the console that one chip is at 51C and the other chip is at 59C.\n The second card was running LSI IT firmware v13, and even though it already saw my connected drives I flashed it with the same new firmware, rebooted, and confirmed all four chips between both boards are running the new firmware. Oddly, the second board is no longer reporting the temperature, and it was running at 50C/66C so it's definitely above the threshold that should be reported. This board is also in the slot against the side of the case and is surrounded by the framework so I expected it to be running hotter anyway.\n Now this second board was also running the oldest firmware, but considering its position I don't think a firmware change could really drop the temps down below what the first card (which is more in the open and getting better airflow) is reporting.\n So I'm stumped. All four chips were flashed from the same firmware file (I also flashed the onboard PERC H710 from the same file) so I don't understand why one board would stop reporting the high temps while the other board still shows them. The test drives I plug into each controller are detected and reading just fine so I know the hardware is all working. I haven't been able to find a CLI utility that will give me the temps directly from the cards but I feel like something may have gone wrong so I want to at least be able to confirm the readings.\n So does anyone have suggestions for why this card stopped reporting the temps, and/or a utility I can grab to verify the actual temps?

I am switching my Cisco SG300 with an ICX-6610 and want to have my trusted high-speed VLANs routed via L3 on the switch while keeping some on the firewall.\n DHCP/DNS is handled on Windows Server. I know I have to create router interfaces for my 4 trusted VLANs, change DHCP option 3 to the IP of that interface and then as it becomes the gateway for those devices, they will route on the switch. \n If I ping a device on VLAN 200-Storage from VLAN 20-Trusted, it would work. However, what happens when a device on VLAN 20 wants to ping a device on VLAN 30-IoT? The rules on the firewall allow that, but how do I ensure what is NOT going to my L3 VLANs get routed to pfSense? \n In other words, I want 4 of my VLANs to be L3 and everything else to be L2 with policy-based routing. I also want my L3 VLANs to be able to communicate with my L2 VLANs.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/thehedgefrog  \n [link]   [comments]",

Understandably my family looked at it as the obnoxious money-sink in the basement that could only be used for sketchy activities. However, after looping my family into three applications I self-host, the complaints have stopped and I have achieved homelab immunity! Those are:\n  \nPlex. Shouldn't come as a surprise to most, but having an increased catalogue of content really spices up movie nights, and with tv shows for days there's less time to complain to me.\n Zoneminder. The ability to keep track of the house while away, practically unlimited recording, and no monthly fees with an Android app sold my averagely tech savvy parents. They feel peace of mind knowing that data is not going to the cloud and is controlled by another nefarious entity instead, me.\n Bitwarden. When I told my mom she didn't have to store her passwords in an excel sheet anymore I swear I saw a glimmer in her eyes. Not only that, but the ability to safely share passwords between family members while also keeping all data in house was great for my dad who routinely unplugs our google home minis so they don't \"spy on us\".\n  \nWhat self-hosted applications or homelab functionality has persuaded the commoner in your life that your homelab is worth it?\n    submitted by    /u/Theduke322  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, I've been putting an older 2U server together for a friend as their first starter homelab. It's on the old side, based on a Supermicro X8DT3-F with the same SAS onboard and one PCI for the extra ports, based on LSI SAS1068E (pre-2008, 3gbps). \n I gave them 6 of the 10TB drives pulled from my own lab (upgraded from 10s to 14s on one of mine) 3 of which was an existing zfs raidz1, After booting up the system I found nothing wrong with importing the existing pool, until I went to add the 3 wiped disks to it. That was when I discovered the SAS controller had a 2.2TB limit to the drive size, even in IT mode. \n I thought to myself \"Self, you know ZFS does some fun stuff to make it function at a low level on the drives, which is why it won't work on a hardware RAID, maybe you shoud make those drives into a zpool and put them back in the system.\" So that is what I did, and to my surprise, the full 10TB was being addressed! I fully expected something to break fantastically when going over the 2.2TB point of any drives, so I loaded those bad boys up with as much random unedited video I could scrounge up, and filled all of them. Despite being rather slow, they survived a scrub and test play of several of the files.\n ​\n In the name of... Science (?) I figure anyone looking to get mega-old servers, or maybe those with some laying around, might find it interesting to turn practically useless hardware into backup servers of last resort, or like my friend, a somewhat slow starter lab. I would be especially interested to see if anyone successfully pulls this off to know I didn't somehow violate the laws of computing, common sense, and all that is holy. So... good luck!?\n    submitted by    /u/SocietyTomorrow  \n [link]   [comments]",

Obvious solution is to use adapters, this brings me to my main question. My main question being:\n ​\n It doesn't seem that anyone sells just the little metal brackets that you screw the 2.5 inch drives into that you would then screw into a 3.5 inch drive bay without including the actual tray. If you've had to solve a similar issue, how did you solve it? Cheapest I've found the bays with brackets is at 8 dollars a piece\n ​\n It seems that the cheapest way of doing it is actually to buy a used drive tray's that come with the adapter bracket, this seems wasteful because I'll never use the drive bays since I already have some and it seems like it could be done cheaper since the bay itself is certainly the most expensive part of it. \n ​\n I found a couple of adequate STLs but I don't have a printer so I'm not sure whether I could actually get brackets for cheaper than the price of whole bays. \n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/CombJelliesAreCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

But was that the best choice? \n Two related but other issues I'm having trouble with and would appreciate any advice on are:\n I know I have HSTS turned off on my Nextcloud/Nginx proxy manager but half the time when I connect via the fqdn from inside my LAN I'll get the HSTS error. A few minutes before or after and it'll seem to be working fine. If I connect from outside the LAN it's usually no issue.. \n When setting up the new nextcloud server, I made a test certificate.

I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.\n Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.\n I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.\n What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.\n How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? \n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/firestorm_v1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I flipped on the TV and about 5 minutes later the UPS started popping and my shooting flames out the side.\n She went for the Fire Extinguisher and I just unplugged it from the wall and it stopped.\n So just a friendly reminder when your UPS complains, LISTEN. Can't imagine how bad this would have been if it decided to go sparky when we were not home.\n    submitted by    /u/Casper042  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question mostly concerns the Mikrotik. Right now I have a home server that serves a samba share for a few kodi boxes, but it also is setup to do reverse proxy with subdomains so I can access my photoprism and jellyfin programs from the internet. Basically instead of typing <ipaddress>:<port> i can type <sitename>.duckdns.org/photoprism Is this something I can accomplish with a Mikrotik router? Or would a dedicated pfsense pc be better? The only reason I haven't decided to go pfsense is because I really don't want a second pc running all day. I guess I could build a new home server that supports virtualization and just run pfsense and my other network apps that way so it would only be one pc running, but I don't really know what kinda hardware I would need to accomplish all that.\n    submitted by    /u/JackBHandy  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi Reddit,\n I have the following setup of servers: Dell PowerEdge R710 (six 3.5” bays)\n Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays) Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays)\n I have the following hard drives: 12x3TB 3.5” drives 8x300GB 2.5” drives 8x600GB 2.5” drives\n I have the 8x300gb in the R620 servers. Since there are six 3.5” bays in the R710, I can put six of the 3TB 3.5” drives there. One problem is that it has the PERC 6/I, which only supports up to 2TB. It also fails to start up at boot 90% of the time, so I want to replace it.\n That leaves me with 6x3TB and 8x600GB.\n I’ve spent some time on eBay, and I’ve found the following: 2xMX827 - This gives me 16 slots (8 per card) so I can have future expansion. These are 2.5” though, so I need another for the 3.5 drives.\n I also found 1xW814D, which is the same board I have in the R710 right now. I can buy another one and connect 6 more drives.\n That means that I will need more SAS controllers. I do not need RAID or whatever. I need to pass them through to Proxmox VE so I can do ZFS.\n The problem is that there is only one backplane power connector per server. My questions are the following:\n  \nHow would I connect more backplanes to power per server?\n \nWhat SAS controller can I use in PCIe that can handle these backplanes (preferably cheap, I’m a student)?\n \nWhat are the part numbers for the cables that I need to connect the backplane to the SAS controller?\n \n Any help is extremely appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/homelabthrowaway0121  \n [link]   [comments]",

My modem does have 2 Ethernet ports. I’ve got 2 identical HP 1810-24G J9803A 24-port switches that they retired at work. I’ve got a Netgear AC1750 Model R6400 and can get another one for about $70.

I'm thinking that i can either:\n - Overcomplicate this setup even more, putting the rack into an \"arm\" so I can lower the rack when i need to work on it\n - Change from a rack setup to a \"wall control\" (kind of like the one technotim has) on the same location\n I much rather not change the location of the setup, since I don't have much space and all of the connections are already in that spot.\n I hope that what i wrote made sense, thanks for letting me pick your brain\n    submitted by    /u/dermonty  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n ​\n I am running an old Asus AC68U router for a 2300sqft home. I have ethernet runs to most rooms. And I also have a 70' ethernet run from the main house to a detached garage. The asus is old, I'm guessing it was purchased in 2015/2016. \n My wireless speeds are actually not bad. 30-60 on the 2.4ghz and 300+ on the 5ghz. The biggest problem is the detached garage, speeds out there are poor off of the netgear AP. \n I have a WAC104 Netgear AP in the detached building and I seem to have trouble with it. My detached garage is the most annoying problem. I have some smart devices out there and I want to be able to control them over LAN from inside the house. But when that AP acts up, they show offline. \n ​\n I'm debating if its worth the money to convert to an omada setup (Router, AP for detached garage, AP for house, and controller). Sounds like Omada would make managing the inside and outside AP's super simple. And if I ever wanted to add an outdoor AP (we may add a pool down the road) I could easily do so. \n ​\n All thoughts and suggestions are appreciated. ISP recently upgraded us from DSL to Fiber. So I went from 6/.5mbps to 500/500!\n    submitted by    /u/Secret-Midnight2313  \n [link]   [comments]",

In such a case, intra-network speeds play a part in the HomeLab experience. How much speed is too little?\n Background: I live in an apartment with a Wi-Fi only environment. I do not have Ethernet lines existent other than lines I choose to run within the apartment. Part of the environment Wi-Fi is WPA2-enterprise and I have absolutely no control whatsoever over the characteristics. I have a 31 dBm signal drop between the WAP and my back bedroom where my HomeLab resides. Currently, I connect to the WAP (wifi5, max 40MHz bandwidth channels) using a GL-iNet AX1800 FLINT (wifi6, configured as a repeater to Ethernet). I have two AV2000 PowerLine adapters which connect back to my HomeLab through the wiring in the apartment (this is a trunk line between two managed switches; the line is very noisy and I have experienced a max of 350Mbps (over a 7 foot distance); down from ~935Mbps using long Ethernet cables only - iperf, measured using two RPi 4Bs on either end). The current speed of this one line is 80Mbps down/64Mbps up. All other Ethernet cables in my HomeLab connected to active devices are at 1Gbps, except two RPi 2Bs which deliver 100Mbps. I mostly use my HomeLab for RPi experiments in conjunction with a VM/LXC Proxmox server.\n So just for grins and snickers, do you think a single line at 80Mbps/64Mbps is intolerable, or adequate?

          "description": "Hi everyone,\n I'm living at my parents house and started to build a small homelab to test stuff (got a power-efficient mini-pc and currently work my way to a nas).\n I got a small corner in the basement under the stairs next to the \"entry point\" of our internet. This is where I put the mini-pc and want to put the nas. The problem is that my main pc is on the third floor.\n Back in the day when the house got built my dad only installed cat5(e?) utp that uses all 4 pairs (so he says and by my research this exists) to transmit 100Mbit down to the basement. While it works, I don't want to connect my nas to 100Mbit and would like to somehow get this to 1Gbit.\n The cables are built into the concrete and can't be removed and my dad doesn't want to spend any time/money on that because \"we only have 50mbit download, so 100mbit is good enough\".\n I know that there are RJ45 Y Splitter that use two 100Mbit 2pair cables to basically make 1Gbit. Is there any chance to make this work with 2 100Mbit 4 pair? I could probably use the Ethernet port in the room next to me, which would mean that the runs are probably not next to each other.\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Unknowniti  \n [link]   [comments]",

The server will be at the other end of the house in the basement from the router (the house is about 1000sqft), and I'm afraid that connecting the mesh to my router and then placing one of the eero nodes in the basement to directly connect to the NAS will drop my speeds considerably.

I had experience with running a 2U server already but with this new one being 4 nodes I want to look into booting them over PXE. I have looked through many guides and they all seem to say similar things, but I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a concrete answer to if someone with experience can help with PXE.\n So with it being 4 nodes I don't want to use 4 different bays just to boot each of them up, I plan on using them for different use cases (a next cloud, and other hosted web-services) and my biggest question is if PXE is a suitable solution for this.\n It seems like PXE is really meant to only boot up installation media to install onto a local disk, so does that mean it isn't really for my use case, since I'm trying to avoid allocating 4 bays just for each node's boot drive. I have heard of iPXE which then uses ISCSI or NFS for persistant user data, which seems to be what I want, but I'm not looking for each node to boot the same files as they will have completely different use cases.\n Anyway, my main question is this, I want to be able to boot all 4 nodes up and each node just running like a standalone server that each has their own web-services to host, all while booting from a PXE server so that I don't have to have a local disk for each of the 4 nodes. I am not looking for someone to explain how to set it all up, I just want to know if PXE booting can do this for me or if I'm sort of barking up the wrong tree and should be looking at a different method entirely.\n    submitted by    /u/BootyMcJudy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have 2 x R620s that I want to turn into a Proxmox Cluster. \n My current plan is to use the compute module on this to install something like TrueNAs, put a 10 gig NIC inside, and have it act as the shared storage for the proxmox HA cluster. Will this work? \n My second question is how best to set things up as it's another area I'm very noobish with. If I go with TrueNAS, I assume I can setup multiple disk pools/file systems? I've got two primary goals:\n  \nHigh speed disk storage for my VMs (only a dozen or so, but I'm impatient, so fast disk IO would be nice). I'd love to be able to clone an ubuntu template in a matter of minutes. \n Raw storage for my media library and other personal documents (with the appropriate backups in place). Current storage usage is around 18 TB on Unraid. \n  \nWith the above in mind, I was thinking about trying ZFS in a mirrored config (raid 10 equivalent) for the VM disk storage, and maybe another pool that is made up of raidz2 for the media? \n I could also try something like ceph or gluster with the 2 x R620s, and just put 6 x SAS drives in each one...that would eliminate the need for a high performance raid in the disk shelf. My goal is a redundant cluster as I want to start self hosting some important things and would prefer to avoid the risk of downtime etc. \n ​\n At this point I'd appreciate any general suggestions/advice. I'm not even sure if I can do what I'm thinking, and if I can do it, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. I did some reading up yesterday on trying to implement high IO ZFS for VM storage and it got over my head pretty quickly.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey /r/homelab\n My lab consists of a 1U server colocated in a local datacenter. It has a ton of CPU, RAM, and Storage for me and my friends to play around with. I've been running XCP-NG on it for years now. Looking to replace the server soon and may change hypervisors. I've run ESXi before but have not dived too deep into it. Does ESXi have these features or some equivalent?\n  \nCan vCenter manage the host behind a virtual network? Some background, the server only has 1 physical uplink that grabs my one IP. This IP goes straight into pfSense so the host itself has no physical network access. Because of this, I have to configure Xen Orchestra to manage the host via virtual adapters.\n Does vCenter offer \"resource groups\"? Xen Orchestra allows you to create Resource Sets. These are set limits on CPU/RAM/Storage that I can assign to a user or user group. This is great for allowing friends to play on my server without touching my stuff. I create a resource group, give them some resources, and they can then login into Xen Orchestra and create/modify/remove VMs at their will. They can't go over their resource limits, and they can't see or modify my VMs at all.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/LV_GC  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given the overwhelmingly positive response, especially to the results post, I decided to make this a yearly thing. This year I have no academic purpose anymore, I'm just doing it to satisfy my own, and hopefully your curiosity.\n The survey can be found here. I have updated the survey a bit compared to last years; I have accounted better for the possibility of virtualisation and asked more detailed hardware questions. The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.\n Of course, results will be posted back to this subreddit. Given that I no longer have any academic constraints, I should be able to post more detailed results than last year, and hopefully somewhat faster ;)\n I have already communicated with the moderators and gotten permission for this post.\n    submitted by    /u/SelfHostingAutomated  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago I bought a bunch of old used parts on eBay and build a modest server. It's a 4c/8T Xeon, m-ITX SuperMicro board, in a Node 804 case. I currently have 2x SSD cache and 5x HDD. I learned a lot but I've outgrown it and really want an upgrade. A few things I learned:\n  \nRegret the Node 804 case. Was a pain to build in. I wish I went full size ATX with a vertical stack of 8 drive bays. Eyeing the Fractal Design Define 7.\n Liked the piece of mind of ECC RAM and dual Ethernet\n IPMI came in clutch a few times\n I don't have enough cores/threads, I'd want at least 8c/16T next time\n I don't have enough PCI slots, only had enough room for one transcode GPU for Plex and one SAS card to expand the 6 SATA ports\n I wish I got a CPU with Intel QuickSync to use for Plex\n  \nSo to address the PCI issue, I figured a board with 10 SATA slots (2x SSD cache, inevitable 8x HDD) would clear that up, be better for cable management, and be one less point of failure vs my SAS card. Plus if I could find a CPU with ECC and QuickSync I'd save a PCI slot. Now I'd have enough room for 1-2 GPUs to finally have better VM performance. I'd want 1 light gaming VM and 1 productivity/streaming VM which could benefit from a basic GPU. If I ever needed more drives I still have my SAS card. So 3 PCI total.\n Another thought, is 10gbe worth it? None of my devices are ready for it, but how nice is it for future proofing? My main computer is an M1 MacBook Pro so I at least have Thunderbolt 4.\n Lastly, I can see a benefit in having a second cache pool for VMs. Probably just a single M.2 drive for VMs.\n The issue with all of the above, is it seems a board that supports: ECC, IMPI, M.2, 10x SATA 6gb/s, Dual 10gbps Ethernet, is $570 which is a lot to go for. It seems only the SuperMicro X11SPI-TF checks all those boxes. Is it worth it in the long run? Or what compromises should I have? I'd appreciate any advice.\n    submitted by    /u/New_Mud_1723  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the main problem is that VPN server IP is easily recognized as IP that belongs to hosting provider. So what I decided to do is to put Raspberry Pi at my home and set up WireGuard on it. \n But I run into a problem. I need to be able to connect to WireGuard server (peer) from outside. And my internet provider doesn't provide me with a public IP to my router, rather than router is behind internet provider NAT which I can't control.\n There is an option to opt into static IP. But they might have a separate pool of static IP, which may raise some red flags that I might be using a VPN. Also, preferably, I wanted to have different incoming and outgoing IPs of my VPN.\n One of the possible ways is reverse tunnels to Raspberry Pi. But since ping is also an issue, I either have to have a server in the same city or use a direct connection.\n What are my best options? My main priorities are to keep my VPN IP less suspicious and keep ping as low as possible (but the distance between server and client is 7000km+, so extra 10-20 ms won't matter).\n If reverse tunnel to can I do it all purely on WireGuard. Let's say I have peer with public IP to which both VPN server and client are connected, and use VPN server as gateway on my client?\n And are there any options to connect directly?

This leads me to believe the tunnel cannot get to IP_OF_FIREWALL for DNS requests.\n I can ping and access everything (including IP_OF_FIREWALL) by IP on my subnets, but DNS will not resolve.\n I have tested this on Windows and Android, both externally. Everything works except DNS.\n ​\n I feel like I'm missing something here whether that be a firewall rule or something stupid. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/cjchico  \n [link]   [comments]",

Maybe a pi acting as DNS with a content blocker for a specific Mac addr? \n Backstory is my 18 year old nephew is using dodgy movie watching sites and such on the WiFi at his Nans and Moms house which raises concerns with the ISP and possible viruses. I've tried advising him so far from an IT Professional standpoint but he's still playing the \"I know better\" card with his Mom and Nan so they want a solution from me to stop him doing those things on their networks as they don't trust him to listen to what I've told him (and I'll be doing it on mine but I already have better routers)\n Naturally because he's 18 so software on his laptop isn't an option so content filtering at a network level feels the best way to go.\n tl:dr - I need a method to block certain content for a certain device (or devices) at a network level as a software block can't be installed on the devices\n    submitted by    /u/OhmegaWolf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some searching about power on this forum and found a lot of guys quoting large numbers but the info on the setup was lacking.\n I am currently looking at acquiring a HP Proliant DL580 G8 4x Xeon E7-4890 4x 1200w and running a project that hopefully will eventually end up with it being maxed out (Lots of virtual machines).\n Now maybe I'm reading this wrong but according to the specs it says that each processor can pull 1200 watts max? Which checks out with the unit having four power supplies?\n My doubt is that since this is a home setup your average room's plug/circuit maxes out at a 1500w pull. Which means if each processor goes above 25% usage then it will blow the circuit. \n Does this mean that people who run these out of their homes have massively beefed up their office/lab wiring to deliver all that power, or does the server just not actually pull that much at normal/low operation? \n I'm happy to start off slow and just run one VM or two on the server while I figure out the power issue, but I'm trying to get an idea from you guys if I need to upgrade my houses wiring (since I do plan on maxing it out eventually), and if I do need to upgrade the home then how much do I realistically expect to draw with it running at low utilization at the beginning when I am learning?

Basically anytime someone types in \"service.mydomian.com\" the connection will initially be blocked. I would then recieve a notification on my phone or an email saying something to the effect of \"111.111.111.111 is trying to connect to service.mydomain.com\" and then provide the options of \"Trust, Allow, Deny\". \n ​\n I like the idea of having yet another layer of security on my internet facing services. However from what I can tell things like Authellia would work just fine for loggining in from a webbrowser, but most of the things I have hosted are used through a companion mobile app and from what I can tell Authellia or others wouldnt work in that scenerio. \n However if the Authentication was done on a secondary device and was completely invisible to the mobile app then I imagine it would work. Such as if I had a friend that I wanted to let use my server, they would download the app and try to login. On the first attempt they will just get an error that says they cant connect. But then I would get notified of the attempted connection where I can choose to permanently trust their IP, Allow it once, or Deny it. Then they try to login again and are able to connect. \n ​\n Does something like this exist?

Unfortunately all four drives give me the orange 'drive failed' light and don't show up at all in the P410i raid card config menu. I know the slots and raid card are good, since the original 72GB drives still work fine. So it seems that the seller was right that they can only be used in a NetApp server (or they're broken, which I have no way of knowing). The thing is, I'm pretty sure from the datasheet that these are not special drives or anything, they should be regular old sas drives.\n Edit: I forgot to mention, the DL360 G6 datasheet does say that the server can handle a maximum of 4TB (8x500GB) storage, but I don't think that's the problem, since I've connected over 5TB of mixed drives, including one 3TB drive, and it's functioned without issue.\n Which leads me to my question. How could drives be configured in such a way that they work on one system (netapp), but completely fail at the hardware level in another (HP)? Beyond that, how can I reformat them to work in my HP server (assuming they're actually functional)?\n Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm very new to enterprise type stuff and I didn't see anything helpful in my quick googling.\n    submitted by    /u/Darkextratoasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was going to do 1 core for pfSense and 1-2GB RAM. The Minecraft server is mostly idle except for maybe one night a week when my buddies and I get on, which is usually at most five of us. HA doesnt ever seem to use much CPU.\n I'm looking at NICs and am looking at Intel ones since I know theyre a bit better and require lower CPU usage.

My first thought was my crawl space, but there are a few problems which need to be overcome to pull this off like temperature and humidity control, access restrictions and cabeling.\n Cabeling for me is easy since the breaker panel and switching is right above it and just need new cables.\n The crawl space is hard to access but having some redundancy in disks and IPMI control on my servers will help out a lot since I don't need to access it daily anyway.\n But the last big problem is temperature and humidity control. I placed a sensor which measures that and logged it for 5 months. In peak summer it never went above 24 degrees and now in autumn it did not went below 18. This is good since it is never too hot and hopefully not too cold even in freezing weather. There are also ventilation holes in case the lab produces too much heat.\n But the humidity! It never went below 95% relative humidity in the summer and in the last month 100%. I read trough the manuals of the hardware I have and it is all rated for below 90%. Hard drives won't be a problem since they are helium sealed. \n So I think this won't be such a problem because humidity only condenses on cold surfaces and servers inherently get warm. Along with the heat it all produces it might push the relative humidity down and not be such a problem.\n I might also put a fan against the exhaust vents in case it gets really bad but I'd rather not because that will definitely screw with the house's isolation since crawl spaces are for isolation of the house.\n Has anyone experience with a setup like this?\n location is the Netherlands btw. house is below water level but water never occurs in the space, it is just really humid\n    submitted by    /u/Wide_Perception_4983  \n [link]   [comments]",

Me ;) .

          "description": "For folks who don't know, Drobo is a NAS type device which creates redundant storage from a bunch of disks, but the key thing is that the disks don't need to match in size. In fact, to increase the size of the storage, you can replace the drives one at time and let it rebuild between each swap, and soon enough you'll have increased the size of array.\n My question is, is there any way i can implement this without a drobo? I've got a pile of mismatched 2.5\" drives which on their own are next to useless, but as part an array they could have quite a bit more life.\n For reference, I'm thinking about a case like this:\n https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Drive-Docking-Station-DS-4SSD/dp/B0711L68MS/\n    submitted by    /u/AuthenticImposter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So when I set up my old Dell PowerEdge R520 running RockyLinux 9 I did not have enough hard drives to create a mirrored zpool using ZFS. Currently, I have 2 3tb drives, 2 8tb drives, and 2 14tb drives (28.6tb used out of 45.2tb). I want to create a mirrored ZFS zpool consisting of 4 8tb drives and 4 14tb drives but unsure of what to do to set that up without wiping the current unmirrored zpool and loosing all of my data. What sort of options do I have? The only ones I can think of are:\n  \nIs there a way to remove the 2 3tb drives from the unmirrored zpool \n Install 2 14tb drives and 2 8tb drives\n Set them up with RAID\n Transfer data from the unmirrored zpool\n Add the drives to the new mirrored zpool\n \n Offload the data from the unmirrored zpool to another set of drives \n Delete the unmirrored zpool and create a mirrored one with the drives I want.\n \n  \n   submitted by    /u/Chrs987  \n [link]   [comments]",

This got replaced by a HP ML310e, E3-1220v2, 32GB RAM, 7x2TB in 2 RAID 5 (3x2 and 4x2) arrays.

Especially that it turns out the 5C NFC is actually 15 EUR, not 10 and shipping is an extra 5 EUR (not free). Plus maybe VAT and fees because I don't live in the EEU.\n Right now, I'm using Bitwarden Premium. It has 2FA for every service that supports it. It's on my iPhone and in my browser. Whenever a site needs a TOTP, Bitwarden automatically fills it in. Services that use SMS as 2FA suck, there aren't many, and when they do that there is no option to use anything else than SMS anyway (or I'd be using Bitwarden for them)\n It's not like it's a hassle to get Bitwarden to enter the TOTP (on the phone or the computer), and I almost never receive the TOTP over SMS.\n So...

I needed to expand into the 12 Gbps realm, and this seemed like a good choice.\n Basically, I need someone to probe the back of their backplane with the power on, and tell me what voltage they get from the gray power cables going into either the motherboard or the backplane. I *think* they are 12v and GND respectively, but I'd rather be sure before I blow up a backplane.\n So, please, if you're able, can someone get me the readings? If not, I'll risk sacrificing a board for science. XD\n Thank you very much!!\n    submitted by    /u/TheMadDutchDude  \n [link]   [comments]",

As a fun experiment, I wanted to see how much I could get out of them. Namely, will it have enough horsepower to run vCenter, vSAN, and Tanzu Kubernetes. \n Result: it technically works. Which is the best kind of works! There is hardly any room for any workload, and likely would not survive if a host failed. Also, each host only has a single 1gb NIC, which means the little switch they're plugged into is pretty much saturated (Ubiquiti Flex Mini). But honestly I am surprised at how smoothly things are running, considering all the performance metrics. vCenter is snappy and vmotions of smallish VMs are only a couple minutes. No perceptible issues, although I'm not running anything particularly heavy.\n https://imgur.com/a/2eieR9l\n 3x Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 Tiny with i3-4130T upgraded to 16gb of RAM (their max allowed). PCIe to M.2 adapter and an additional 256gb NVME drive (replaced the wifi card to be used as vSAN cache. Technically all-flash, but configured as Hybrid to cut down on Memory overhead). All in, under $400 total.\n If I were to do it again, I'd probably shell out for m700 tinys which can get up to 32gb of RAM. I didn't go for them in the first place because they would be significantly more expensive and I wasn't ready to spend more money for a homelab of my size. (Lets be honest, all I need are a couple Raspberry Pis). I likely will keep vSAN configured and add larger capacity drives to run 'old fashioned' VMs instead of containers.\n    submitted by    /u/ariesgungetcha  \n [link]   [comments]",

After moving around, it didn't have a place and instead ended up in the middle of the floor in the living room with cats all over it (resulting in hair and various other gross things in the parts). I needed to rack it, but with racks come a bunch of new issues I am now learning to deal with. After moving the system over to the new case, the motherboard wouldn't boot. So I elected to get another one, since it had IPMI built in and I was gonna have to get an IPKVM anyway.\n My new configuration is as follows:\n  \nASUS X99-WS/IPMI\n 128GB DDR4-3000 RAM (combination of the previous 64GB kit with another 64GB kit, both kits are from the same manufacturer with the same timings)\n Xeon E5-2696v4\n QNAP QM2-4P-384A\n 2x IBM M5110 (LSI 9207-8i)\n Bunchmore drives\n  \nThis is getting put into a Supermicro 846E16-R1200B (originally bought a Norco RPC-4224 but ended up returning it in favor of a used R1200B). Now I'm running into a host of other issues, namely it seems like there's more headers on this ASUS X99 board than is available on the Supermicro chassis. Is this board incompatible with this case? I don't know what I have to do to get this thing to just fucking work but I'm really getting to the end of my patience trying to get this to do it's thing and any help would be wholly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/dpunk3  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, I'm a bit of a newbie here but I've done a fair bit of research and I work in cybersecurity. \n ​\n I have a Dell R820 that I've been using for a while. It's the model with 4 CPU sockets, all of which are populated. It came with 16GB sticks of RAM in slots A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, and D3. These are all 16GB 2Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks and the server has been working fine. I have 8 sticks of 16GB 4Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks of RAM that came from a different Dell server. I read that I could mix Dual Rank and Quad Rank sticks, but interpreted part of what I read as I couldn't mix the different types on the same channel. So I put the Quad Rank sticks on A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2; and put the Dual Rank sticks on starting on the next channel as A5, A6, A7 etc. \n Is this the correct way to do this? When I booted it said it was configuring the new memory setup, but then it disabled the 7th slot for each channel (A7, B7, C7, D7). Should I just put the Quad Rank sticks on the first 2 slots of each channel and then put the Dual Rank sticks in starting on the 3rd slot of each channel? Any help is appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/soandso90  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have those installed and have been trying to install Proxmox and have been getting nothing but errors. \n When trying to install using RAIDZ-2 I get an error that the ZFS root pool could not be created. So I tried installing to a single disk and got an error that it was unable to initialize physical volume /dev/sda3. I tried with each of the 4 drives individually and got the same error but instead referencing sdb3, sdc3, and sdd3. \n So I tried going the route of installing Debian first and when trying to just install it on a single disk I got the error: The creation of swap space in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,2,0) (sdc) failed. I tried on each disk and got the same error.\n That was all in HBA mode, so I tried to create a RAID using the H730. Each time I created one (RAID 1, RAID 10, RAID 6) it showed the status of the RAID as failed. When I would go into the Debian installer, neither the array nor the disks showed up so I could tell it wasn't working. \n I have flashed the latest firmware to the RAID card and still no luck. I can't imagine all 4 disks are dead since I bought them from someone on r/homelabsales who had quite a lot of confirmed trades.

          "description": "I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).\n Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.\n Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5\" bays and is less than 19\" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.\n ​\n Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?\n This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082\n This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/\n This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179\n    submitted by    /u/icelandismine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.\n This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.\n I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow.

There is no other backup of the data (I know, shame me) and the drives are old and some are smr so another failure during resilver is possible.\n Now the data is a mix of music, movies and photos. The photos account for around 1 TB, music a few hundred gigs and movies about 13TB. The photos are most important as I can't replace those of I lose them but the music and movies could be replaced tho it would be a pain.\n My thought is to copy the photos to another pool while this one is still degraded and then resilver the pool. If i lose a drive while copying it wasn't going to survive the resilver anyways and I get some of my data, if the copy completes and then a drive dies in resilver I save my photos which is what I care most about.\n Any flaws with this plan?

          "description": "My question is essentially the title and mostly comes from idle curiosity. Do they not make 2.5\" CMR drives anymore? I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.\n The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.\n TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.\n Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...\n    submitted by    /u/KRS_88  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "This is a \"problem\" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.\n The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.\n One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on \"disk1\" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.\n To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.\n Some info about my system:\n  \nOS: Arch Linux\n Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1\n Asus Prime H510M-K\n Intel i3-10100\n 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)\n Disks directly connected to the motherboard\n  \nI experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.\n I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.\n I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.\n    submitted by    /u/bepsifif  \n [link]   [comments]",

By HBA, mean SAS HBA devices.\n My question would be - Why such devices are preferred in comparison to plugging many HDDs to SATA ports? \n At the moment I have 6 drives connected, these already populate entire motherboard's available SATA ports. Also have an PCI Express SATA Controller Expansion Card (1 x PCIe X1 to 4 SATA), but currently there is no need in more slots. While on other hand probably I would like to expand drive pool later. Heard such cards are not recommended, because often cheaply built and can affect speeds as all drives will share single interface.\n    submitted by    /u/q1525882  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.\n The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...\n Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression?

This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.\n Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.\n The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.\n This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.\n https://github.com/avalonv/reCBZ\n    submitted by    /u/reallyfuckingay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. \n I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault\n It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.\n So my best thought is that ideally \"everyone\" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.\n Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the \"library of alexandria\" idea.\n Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.\n Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group! Excited to learn more of how people are backing up their life.\n    submitted by    /u/NatureVault  \n [link]   [comments]",

I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. \n I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. \n I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB.

          "description": "I was recently given four of these 5.25\" hot swap bays from my workplace. As I already have an old case, fan and PSU, I'd like to build a cheapo DAS setup.\n USB to SATA enclosures are all over the place, so I assumed it would be straightforward to find the standalone adapters or break-out board I'd need. Not so, it would seem!\n Cables like these are available and fine for 2.5\" drives, but unsuitable for 3.5\" drives as I'd be powering them separate from the data cable. On the other hand, cables like this require an external barrel plug for power, which I'd have to duplicate four times. Ideally, I'd like to manage power with my PSU using the paperclip method.\n Are there any USB-C to SATA3 adapter boards on the market? Aliexpress, Amazon and eBay are failing me.\n Probably the best option I found was this adapter, but it looks to be long out of manufacture.\n If not, what do you think is the best approach here?\n Thanks for the advice!\n    submitted by    /u/SufficientBack  \n [link]   [comments]",

I got no space in my computer so, i'm just doing some research on keeping hard dives offline and what the recommendtaions are to ensure the data is protected over the long term.\n For safe storage of the drives the interwebs say:\n  \nStore the drives at room temp somewhere where it cant be dropped!\n Avoid storing the drives in any moisure or damp areas.\n Put them in anti-static durable cases.. Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.\n  \nBut what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?\n From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? \n If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? \n And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk? (and prevent bitrot)\n Also, how frequently should we be doing this? ..every 3 months? ..every 6 months? ..every year? \n How many of you guys are storing drives offline like this? And have you ever lost any data this way due to bad storage or data getting corrupted somehow.\n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/masterofmisc  \n [link]   [comments]",

We want to monitor everything from smartphones on Samsung.com to sneakers on StockX.\n He also mentioned a few bots that scalpers use, like StreetMerchant and NerdSpeak/NerdSeek; however, those tend to either break or also face the same retailer limitations as Restockify.\n To be clear, we're also not looking to scalp. We just want more comprehensive updates on product inventory at places like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, GameStop, etc. to tweet and write articles about them for everyday consumers as an extension of our product reviews arm. Pretty standard affiliate marketing content.\n As an example, Future plc (publisher behind TechRadar, Tom's Guide, PC Gamer, etc.) has a working proprietary version of exactly what we're looking for. I'm just wondering if there's an open-source application or paid service we could use that meets the same needs.\n    submitted by    /u/FrackingEnthusiast  \n [link]   [comments]",

Something that can backup all of my PCs, servers, documents from the last 25 years, and maybe stream some movies and music. DAS or NAS, I'll figure it out either way depending on the price point.\n I want some software that will allow me to backup my children's pictures, as well as my pictures from anywhere. It would be great if it could also backup my OneDrive, Google Drive etc. My son is up at Ole Miss, my daughter and son-in-law are in Jacksonville, FL. He is a Marine.

I want to be able to access it from my phone from anywhere to see the pictures stored locally on my home computer/Drobo or similar storage device.\n  \n​\n So - there must be someone on here who is like me and researches this crap until their eyes bleed trying to find the best solution for the very best price.

I am thinking for example, what if someone uploads a copyrighted movie and uses my platform to share it. (I think this is the most likely scenario to happen, but you guys can maybe think of more) \n What am I to do, to prevent malicious use and what am I responsible for? What kind of legal charges could be made against me if a user uses my service like this.\n I own a registered business and would make individual contracts with each user including sending out invoices etc. So I know every user by name, adress and bank details at least. I think that should prevent the most evil kind of malicious use but I am still worried about some of the lesser ones. \n Every thought about this topic is appreciated. \n Cheers and happy hoarding\n    submitted by    /u/Sinath_973  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have recently moved away from Synology to a server running Ubuntu and ZFS (for reasons). \n One of the things I was using however that worked reasonably well was Synology’s Drive client. I have a few directories that I need to keep data synced to share amongst a few windows machines. Drive did this pretty well. \n I’ve looked around a bit, and the options seem slim in comparison to the same experience I had with drive. Here’s some of the things I’ve considered:\n  \n rclone, currently top of the list. Doesn’t quite capture my requirements, but could mash something up scheduler to sync a few times a day or something \n  Freefilesync, bravo for open source but looks clunky\n  Syncthing, love the concept, but hate the idea of having to run a client on the NAS. I also don’t need the data encrypted in transit\n  Bypass all this nonsense and just store my data directly on the share. The only problem with this approach is there are times when I am mobile with no connectivity and still need a locally cached copy to work from to sync back later. \n  \nI’ve seen a few paid for options as well which I am not opposed to, but wanted to get an idea from folks that may have followed a similar path as myself.\n    submitted by    /u/digilink  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, so something I have been thinking about recently is starting to build and sell custom pc systems. I’m looking at starting with making NAS servers. Instead of purchasing (for example) a Synology NAS and then installing drives. Would you consider purchasing a custom solution at a cheaper price (for comparable specs) or more/better specs for the same price?\n An initial build plan comes to around £600 but provides 4 x 4TB ironwolf drives in Raid 5 for a total storage capacity of about 12TB. Plus the ability to run additional ‘modules’ on the server to allow for more than just NAS functionality.\n Any suggestions/feedback or ideas are welcome.

Occasionally I use the NAS to stream some videos to my TV. I don’t use the NAS for anything other than that. Since buying a new camera, my storage capacity is filling up very quickly. \n It’s very important to me that I don’t lose these files so I have the drives set in RAID1.

These are the options as I see them:\n Option 1 is to buy new drives with bigger capacity and use these to replace the drives I already have. \n Option 2 is to buy a NAS with 4 bays.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I normally buy Seagate hard drives and have had good experience with their RMAs, especially since they still include return shipping as part of their Advanced RMA program (at least they did last year) and their staff is on-shore in North America.\n One of myWD Red 10TB died over the weekend in my unRAID setup after <2 years of service so I setup an Advanced RMA for $25 USD, so far so good, but the drive that they sent me was DOA, it won't even boot - can't be recognized in my USB dock nor in my server's SATA slots. So much for being \"certified\".\n DOA should not be a problem right?\n Most companies will take care of customers when it's their issue, so I call up WD, and they say:\n  \nThere can only be one Advanced RMA outstanding\n They will setup a standard RMA for the DOA replacement\n They want me to ship the DOA replacement and then WD will send the replacement - so much for \"Advanced RMA\".\n  \nI paid $25 for Advanced RMA, and I got nothing out of it except a DOA drive - now I have to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement drive. Amazing they're so inflexible with their RMA system, I guess that's what happens when all the staff is outsourced overases.\n I'm surprised at the bias towards WD, especially with how poor their RMA process is. This alone is going to put me off buying WD drives for my NAS even if Seagate supposedly has a higher failure rate (which they may, but replacements are easy to come by!).\n Anyone else facing troubles with WD RMAs?\n I have about 50 - 60 drives in my various NAS devices, and this is the second time in a row that I've had issues with WD RMAs, during 2020, it took several months to get my RMA back, and the lack of communication and inflexiblity of their RMA department doesn't seem to be addressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Onion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi guys quick question that may be dumb but I’ve never built a pc. The Corsair HX850 has 6 peripheral/sata ports but only comes with 4 Sata cables. I see a lot of talk about using sata power splitters, but couldn’t I just buy a couple extra Sata power cables from Corsair? \n Is there anything I’m missing here? How many drives can I power on the HX850? 5v @ 25amp on this psu.\n I’m probably gonna have this PSU powering only Sata drives in a DAS box. Might have to save a sata/peripheral port for the HBA expander. Is that gonna be a problem electric wise since I’m not powering any 12v components? And how does the switch for single or multiple 12v rails work for my use case? \n Any tips would be appreciated thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Sale7548  \n [link]   [comments]",

Veracrypt, Boxcrypt solves this problem by adopting a volume based approach but it's not suitable for cloud storage.\n Some tools I've used:\n  \nRclone - By far the most stable but sadly it neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening. By using the crypt remote, the files sizes do change, but it's a static transformer which can be easily deciphered to get plaintext size. By using chunker along with crypt, file sizes could be hidden to some extent, but not completely.\n Cryptomator - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Securefs - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Gocryptfs - Neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening.\n CryFS - Supports both file size obfuscation and directory flattening !! In theory this should be a good fit, but sadly it suffers from terrible performance issues due to the fact that it chunks files into fixed size small blocks (4kb - 32kb).

Currently, this is chaos since sometimes another student is already at the computer their project is saved onto. \n I've narrowed it down, but still a bit lost on the specifics:\n 1) Symlink / Network drive - What drive is worth it, what is overkill? 1TB would be enough for all purposes now, but a 2TB would be ok too. Speed is important(project load times should be as minimally affected as possible), but a bit tough to gauge what is needed. Sata/m.2/nvme? dram? no idea.\n 2) NAS - This seems to be more robust, but I'm a small school with about 30 projects(5-10gb average size) and not need insane scaling, just speed. Would a RAID 0 make a big difference? \n Hard-drive mirroring would be nice, but could upgrade to it later and just do regular backups to start. \n This is a surprise expense so don't want to spend for something that would be a negligible upgrade, but want to make sure my students get what they need and not cheap out. \n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SenorTeddy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've since confirmed this with another drive and another Windows 7 machine. Thing is, I've not been able to find anything indicating a maximum AUS for Windows 7.

Usually saved because it is in the deleted folder but there have been pictures that have been completely wiped. \n So to tackles this, I was thinking of setting up a NAS Drive but I don't know how much space would be apt. I myself have 110GB worth of pictures. My family members to have more. It's likely to be a home server? I am not sure. \n I wondered if I could give each family member 1TB of space.

I'm currently using a Ubuntu 22.04.x VM with ZoL with the PERC H730 passed through.\n To get a single share I'm currently using mergerFS to combine my pools + gdrive. Biggest issue is that mergerFS as far as I've seen just prioritizes the first \"drive\", fills that up and them moves to the next drive without any kind of distribution. That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.\n The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now.

          "description": "I like to name my photos and videos in the yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss format so that when I sort them by name, all the photos and videos of a particular event show in the order they were shot in, not to mention that memories shot by different people of the same event shows in an integrated manner.\n I have used XNView for years on Windows. I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.\n Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.\n Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).\n Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.\n I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.\n Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?\n    submitted by    /u/GuruDev1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've had an interest in revisiting some old iOS apps I used to play as a kid so I've been looking into where I can download some of the delisted ones. I've noticed though that archive.org seems to be having trouble keeping IPA files available for download, or at least I assume so.\n For example, one of my favorite iOS games, Gesundheit! by Matt Hammill, has been delisted for a few years now. I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).\n Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/J0mSp00ns  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figured if there was anywhere that could help me with large storage servers, it'd be r/datahoarders\n I recently had a bad electrical experience which knocked out my storage server. ( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. \n My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array. (none of the drives in question were from the original failure) I am at a complete loss at what kind of formatting and partitioning these drives were set up with. The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.\n First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.\n  \nMacroit says they're each just one large logical partition\n AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions\n Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.\n  \nWhen I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.\n I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.\n I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.\n    submitted by    /u/ArcTechNerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a pretty large physical movie collection (mixture of blu-rays and 4k UHD blu-rays). 99% of the time I'm watching these movies at my PC on my 21:9 ultrawide monitor, so I started ripping the files off the disk and put them on an external drive.\n The problem is I have a mini-ITX PC that is already packed to the brim and can't fit any extra drives beyond the couple m.2 slots on the motherboard. I also don't have a lot of desk space to store a large desktop HDD, NAS, etc., etc. I decided on a 5TB portable USB-powered external, because at least at the time (and I think still now) that was the largest size I could get in that form factor). \n When 4k blu-ray files are upwards of 60gb and regular blu's are like 30gb, a 5TB would fill up relatively quickly. So I started encoding the files using handbrake (for a number of reasons, but one being I could knock those file sizes down by at least half, if not more). \n I'm using Nvidia NVenc to encode my files because it's a lot faster using the GPU vs CPU, but I've only just recently realized that the quality suffers. Tbh, it's not the worst thing in the world I've ever seen, but when I compare it to the original ripped movie file I can see the difference and now I can't live with it. \n So, now I'm thinking I'm not going to encode at all and just gonna store the original movie files as is. I guess this means I'm gonna need a lot more than 5TB, though, but my problem still stands that I just don't have a lot of desk space for larger external drives. \n The other issue is that anything more than those 2.5\" portable drives usually require their own power brick and it will be nearly impossible for me to access an outlet at this point around my desk. \n Do I have any options? Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions based on my restrictions?\n    submitted by    /u/clothing_throwaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

And conversely, will it be possible to disconnect such drives with the Windows option to \"Safely Remove Hardware\" while the PC is running?\n I've searched for hours and can't find answer to this question, but perhaps I'm not asking correctly, and this is actually a question of \"Can you hot swap external drives connected to SAS HBA\" ? 🤐 \n I realize most people are using HBA cards for more extensive, dedicated, always-on storage purposes. I really want to have option to connect SATA drives in external eSATA enclosures to my Win10 PC, AND have the option to attach them while Windows is running, and remove them using the Safely Remove Hardware option, also while Windows is running.

          "description": "Backstory\n I live in Europe and back in 2018 a friend of mine was in the US and picked up a few Easystore 8TBs for me. I shucked them all and put them in my Synology NAS. All worked bar one which could not be detected. I connected it back to my PC first using a WD Elements adapter/case (the Euro version of the Easystore) and the drive was not even detected. Then I used the Easystore \"adapter\" and it powered up but it was detected as a 2TB drive and I could do nothing with it. Windows Disk Manager said it needed to be initialized but threw an error when I tried. WD Utilities said the SMART test failed and that I had apparently entered a password wrong 5 times. The only option was to Erase but then it threw an exception with no details when I tried that. It was a legit disk too, not one that someone had swaped out and sent back to the store. Since I was not in the US and I had shucked it I assumed I would get no help from WD and put it in a box and forgot about it.\n So now in 2022 its out of warranty and I am curious if there is anything I can do to revive it? Amazingly I still had the adapter from the Easystore case attached to it. I plugged it in again today and it was the same as before. I dont hear any funny sounds either. It spins up when I connect it to the computer, shows up in Disk Manager, still as 2TB but I still cant do anything with it.\n One thing I am not sure about is whether the Easystore adapter I am using is the one that came with the 8TB drive. I had a batch of Easystore 3TB drives previously and it may be from those so maybe that is having trouble with the 8TB drive. The product id is 25fb firmware revision 3004 according to WD Utilities\n    submitted by    /u/brimur  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the new drives, for lack of any motivation one way or another, I’ve setup as RAID0. My motherboard handles the RAID and so now I’ve got a single 24TB volume in Windows. I’m using Win7 Pro still but that’s fine. The usage for this drive will be a lot of virtual machines, as well as a junk drive for downloading and parsing through gobs of data to save what I want and trash the rest. Aside from that, no idea… whatever the future holds. I’m also getting a RAM upgrade in a few days I’ll be installing new chips and get myself up to 32GB RAM. Mostly to accommodate running a bunch of VMs. \n So, my question is: do you think raiding them is overkill and unnecessary, and should I instead make them jbods? I’ve had this machine for quite a few years already and the mobo has done a great job with my C drive raid, so I don’t really have any worries about messing up an array due to anything other than actual damage. \n I’m just trying to make the best decision now, before the drive starts to really accumulate a lot of data. \n Thanks for any opinions you may have.\n    submitted by    /u/AndrewZabar  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be happy to hire someone here locally to set it up but information on it already feels overwhelming. \n Solution 3: Just say fuck it and store it unencrypted? \n Not sure what you guys would recommend but yeah.

After all, the breakout cables are using RCA connectors, which S-Video was deliberately designed to circumvent. I'm just a bit skeptical and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether or not that would be an issue, and of course I am also open to other capture card recommendations! \n Thanks!

          "description": "I'm not used to Reddit so apologies if this is the wrong place or I screw something up. \n I have a very old hard drive (HGST Touro 1tb external drive from like ten years ago, it's been with me forever and the exterior is full of scratches from impacts that it honestly shouldn't have survived.) I use it purely to back up unimportant data since it could die any moment now.\n I'm transferring files from it onto a new drive after the previous one had to be RMA'd and I noticed something strange. When transferring one particular file, the transfer froze and so did crystaldiskinfo which I was using to monitor the new drive under load. The \"read error rate\" value kept decreasing (meaning the errors were going up). I figured the drive was finally dead or it was an issue with the specific sectors holding that file. Killed the transfer, started it again excluding that file. Everything started moving smoothly again. \n However, what struck me as odd was that once I did that, the \"read error rate\" value reset to the default value of 100, as did the \"worst\" value. As if nothing had happened at all. I just checked it again and the transfer is still going, but the \"read error rate\" value was back down to 98, then reset itself when I refreshed crystaldiskinfo. No other utility shows an issue either. I know the drive's probably dead. but anyone have any clue why the value keeps resetting?\n    submitted by    /u/Hargan1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be streaming mostly to my laptop, but also to smartphones and TVs from time to time, so it would be nice if it had transcoding capabilities.\n I tried reading through the wiki, but I simply felt overwhelmed by the information and decided I'd rather ask for an informed opinion, so any advice is very much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/fabiorzfreitas  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have several files that aren't needed in a daily basis (or even a yearly basis), and it seems a waste to not burn them into optical disks (even multiple times) or even external USB disks (HDDs or SSDs). I don't want to lose what I have stored in the extenrnal disks though, because I may end up re-downloading it. Additionally, I seem to have some files in multiple disks (for reasons), or similar files that I want to reorganize. It seems I have multiple VHDs taken from various systems, for example, all strewn in multiple external USB HDDs.\n In my ideal world, somebody will have made a special file system that would keep the list of the files (maybe with some minimal extra metadata, such as checksums, thumbnails, duration etc) offline, and when you do a modifying file operation (such as moving a file from one folder to the next), the UI for the file system would ask you to insert disk A to do the writes (or maybe insert disk A and disk B so that it can move the files from one disk to the next, or insert CD A to copy the files from it and mark them as deleted, etc.). Does such a program exist? Has anyone used anything like it.\n As a second best solution, I'd like something that you just register a disk (optical or HDD/SSD) and it records what it has on it and displays within its own UI (so no actual file system). I'm pretty sure something like that exists, but my searches have been fruitless - maybe I'm not describing this correctly.\n I figured if something like this exists, this subreddit is probably the best place to ask.\n    submitted by    /u/gschizas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Is there someone interested in just, maybe achieving our work or maybe even contributing to our IoT devices database list?\n The contribution procedure is simple. Make screenshots from shop, take photos of package, take photos of device insides (preferrably good quality), write down chip names, do a eletronic analysis if you can, do a firmware dump if you can (with UART tool ,not necessary), post it to our Elektroda forum (our reliable hosting, this forum has about 20 years history) and I will add your work to the list.

It's 90% static files, and those that do change, I'm not concerned with snapshots too much\n However, for backing up, I've previously just rsynced to a bunch of USB drives, which is not practical, so I'm setting up a new solution. At the moment, I have still got USB drives, grouped into one big LVM, on a VM server, with a 20TB LVM-thin drive pointed at a backups VM. Little complicated, but will be very easy to expand (though I am fully aware that one dead drive will kill the backup and I will need to start again - I'll have a 3-2-1 in place soon too though)\n Anyway, looking at the backup solutions on here, there's loads of options, such as Borg and rdiff, as well as simply rsync, but I am aware that ZFS has two very useful features (I'm not well versed in ZFS though sadly!):\n  \nSnapshots, in case I completely bork something and don't notice until 3 backups later\n \nDeduplication. I have a \"staging\" area for ripped Blu-ray content, and sometimes it's too much effort to rename them straight away, and it's likely they'll get caught in a backup and duplicated, which could waste lots of backup storage\n \n If I'm right, ZFS should be a solid file system choice for the backups server. My concern though is I could dedicate about 8GB of RAM to it, which is well below the suggestions I hear\n Failing all this, I guess I'll just try one of the mentioned softwares\n    submitted by    /u/KoolKarmaKollector  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know we have a gencom file for each side of the family, but I want to make it more collaborative.\n What is the best way to create a collaborative master family tree with gencom AND media like photos/videos/audio?\n  \nI don’t want to use a geneology online service where our data is discoverable by others and not owned by us. Another consideration is exporting and backing up the data and especially media from a site like that. We can use those sites mainly just for research purposes.\n \nI was thinking about using GitHub for the gencom file since it is simple text data, not public if you don’t want, users can have specific edit permissions, merges have to be reviewed before publishing, and there is versioning history, and backs up offline\n \nBut gencom allows for storing links to media content. What is the safest and most cost-effective way to archive all of this data for offline and also allow users to add new sources (not remove existing ones)? I assume cloud storage with an automatic local backup, but that’s a lotttt of files….\n \n I’m sure there is already good info for the media storage question on this subreddit, but I’m not sure if there are any special considerations for genealogy.

The main use is an \"oh shit\" something went horribly wrong backup. \n So, I was wondering, before I delete my backup and give it a spin, has it matured more on windows? How does it compare, or maybe there's something even better than both. Crashplan was still amazing and then got killed very soon after I used it sadly, and ARQ was the closest because of the real time scanning, but yeah, not working because it couldn't properly respect the destination size limits was a no go.\n    submitted by    /u/XOIIO  \n [link]   [comments]",

Sorry if it's long I try to be as detailed as possible in case someone here spots something fishy.\n I have a 1 year old Western Digital 12TB Elements Desktop Hard Drive that I use to back up all my critical data. Had a planned backup for a 400GB file today and plugged the hard drive in. I copied and transferred the folder over and left to let it so its thing. \n However I came back 10mins later to an error message. \"Error 0x800701b1. An unexpected error is keeping you from copying this file....\" For some reason my wireless mouse had failed at the same time, and my PC had hanged/lagged? I almost had to force shut down my PC. Eventually got my mouse and PC running again and tried to eject my HDD but found that in the period my PC was hanging, my hard drive had ejected itself.\n I eventually plugged in again. And then transferred the folder into the drive in chunks.\n 1) Has anyone here seen anything like this before? What happened here? What should I do :(\n 2) Have I lost data from my original 400gb file due to an interrupted transfer+ an improper ejection of my drive?\n    submitted by    /u/pinkapple1998  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, after reading a ton on here and living through a decade of my Drobo. It's time to sunset my 5D (I had a 4D before that). It's flaky and i can't even see it on my Drobo dashboard anymore. Luckily, I can still see the fie, but I know I'm on borrowed time.\n I've been actively considering a Sinology NAS or an OWC DAS answer. Since I'm likely to from from CrashPlan/Code42 to Backblaze, I need a DAS solution. Crashplan is like Drobo for my cloud backup. I'm so mad. \n Can someone sanity check my logic/ thinking:\n I think I've settled. I'm going to get an OWC T-bday 4 with 24TB total. That should get me 18TB of storage which should last 2-4 years at least. At that point, i'll probably buy another 4bay (or get an 8 bay and effective run two 4's inside. My photo archive is' a little under 12TB today and that' most of what will be on there\n It comes configured with Raid 5, but OWC rep said RAID 4 was better for media. I'm not sure there's a big difference and I'm inclined to keep it \"as it comes\". \n FWIW - I work locally and only use the external for storage and re-accessing photos over time. So performance isn't a huge issue on the volume itself. I just need to to be reliable and store my stuff with some reduncy.\n It sounds like the soft-RAID they provide will also work well. The downside is that I'll go down to single disk redundancy. My Drobo currently allows two drives to fail before i'm screwed. However, Drobo itself is a failure, so I'm not sure that's much solace. \n Any reactions or caveats? I'm probably going to order it today if not.\n Essentially: * TBay 4 - 24TB model with enterprise drives * SoftRaid - keep as delivered with RAID 5 * Live my life.\n Am I missing anything big?\n kb\n    submitted by    /u/kbevphoto  \n [link]   [comments]",

The backup will grow, but not delete anything from the NAS or cloud. But pictures on the phone can be deleted to save phone space.\n Currently, it's just a Windows plex server but it has 5tb of usable drive space. I've been hearing that Docker is the new way to do things, it would separate all the different self hosted programs I run. \n I'm trying to decide between Nextcloud and Seafile. Every so often, I need to be able to upload a backup to a cloud like backblaze, plus an external drive that lives in a safe.

Given 'old' hardware is now stuff like Haswell are 10 years old now, supporting up to 32GB of DDR3-1866 Memory and even support M.2\n This hardware is more than capable of being used as a NAS. But most Boards & CPU's don't support ECC, so I'm wondering why we can't use software to mitigate a lack of ECC memory?

I've currently got a couple 4TB drives in RAID1 on OpenMediaVault, but it's filling up fast. After some research, I was planning on making an offsite NAS for redundancy.\n I figured a RAID6 of like 16TB each Seagate Exos drives would be okay for offsite redundancy, it has two drives that can fail, and can hold a lot of data on a smaller number of drives (was going to start with four, and possibly go to as many as six, depending on my usage. Since it's offsite, I wanted it to be as low-maintenance as possible)\n I was then going to set up my home NAS in a raid 5 of some smaller size also on OMV (6TB a drive, for example.) I figure it's less safe, but will still have a drive failure supported, as well as faster reads for the same amount of storage as compared to a larger drive.\n With the offsite redundancy, I'm not sure if that would count as a backup, or if I should have a tertiary option somewhere. I've only ever done cold storage for single disk backups, I'm not sure how that would work with say 25+TB of data.\n Is my proposed implementation stable? Are there any things I've overengineered, or should do differently within the limitations of only having 8 bays in my local system? I don't plan on filling them all at once, I figured the 3 drives minimum for a raid 5 and 4 minimum of a raid six should hold me over for maybe a year, unless it's better to create the max size array at once, to cut down on syncing?\n    submitted by    /u/thextallxdude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've essentially highlighted all the folders on the Seagate and copy/pasted them over to the Synology through the network folders, but what I've now realised is this is taking the data from the Seagate and sending it through my computer, which then passes it to the Synology - not exactly the most efficient way of doing things and is taking its sweet time.\n I don't suppose there's a way to do this in a more direct manner, through the interfaces of each NAS instead so that they can just talk to one another directly on the network rather than using the computer as an intermediary? I did have a look around, but couldn't find a solution.

I took a look at the SMART info today and it got me concerned. I have backups of everything on both of them and my OS is installed on an SSD so I wouldn't lose any data if they did die, but of course I want to extend their life as much as possible. Hard drives don't grow on trees. \n The drives are pretty old, the temperatures are okay and I do not have older SMART data to compare and see if the number of uncorrect/able and pending sectors is increasing or not. Here's the SMART info for both of them:\n Disk 1\n Disk 2\n There was also a bunch of errors:\n Errors\n I am also very concerned about all the \"prefailure warning\" flags NOT on the attributes marked as problematic. \n But oddly, with all this wrong, I still get the following message:\n  \n=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION === \n SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED\n  \nSo, my questions to you fine people are: \n  \nI know there's a big margin of error, but how long should I expect these drives to last? \n Why does SMART say \"passed\" with all those errors? \n What immediate action would you take in my shoes? I'd like to avoid replacing them but if the risk is too big, that's what I'll have to do.\n  \nPlease and thank you for your time.\n    submitted by    /u/Peruvian_Skies  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am very thankful, and happy to say that some great enhancements have been made over the last 5 months.\n YT-RED v1.0.2.0 Beta is now available\n Included in the update is a major overhaul of the UI, reducing the original 2-tab design to a single tab (suggested by u/Kendjin) that supports downloads from Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo and more.\n Another neat feature included in the update is automatic ID3 tagging for audio downloads, including thumbnail images (requested by u/asifaqeel50)\n YT-RED is and will always remain Ad-Free and Completely Free to use with no tracking or data-collection, and public source-code on GitHub.\n For a full list of features and fine details\n View the YT-RED Project Page on github.io or check out the Beta Code in the Source Repository\n Please Note - YT-RED is not an open-source project While YT-RED source-code is made public and uses several open-source libraries and resources, I unfortunately cannot label it as \"open-source\" as it uses paid-license WinForms controls by DevExpress. While anybody is free to download the source code, it will not build without a valid DevExpress WinForms license.\n If anyone has read this disclaimer and still has an interest in contributing to the project, I'll be more than happy to work with you.\n Thank you all so much for your support earlier this year.

I'm running a jellyfin media server on my nas, and I can only seem to make it accessible on my home network, no matter what configuration changes I make, and at this point I'm out of ideas.\n I have a domain registered through Cloudflare pointing at my home IP address, a WebStation portal for that domain pointing to the correct port, and another one just for that port. It's accessible just fine on my home LAN, either through [hostname].local:[port] or through Synology QuickConnect, but if I try to connect through my domain, it just displays the standard \"Your website is not set up yet\" splash page that it usually shows when webstation isn't set up properly, and if I try to use QuickConnect, it just won't connect at all. I have port forwarding set up on my router for the relevant port, and I plan to eventually set up ssl for the jellyfin instance, but for now I just want it to connect at all.\n I don't have much experience with networking (I started and didn't finish a CS degree) and I'm frankly all out of ideas.

It's served me loyally, but I have a new remote work job, and it's time for an upgrade. I recently ordered a new Mac studio that will serve as my new mothership for work and all my personal/important files... but I still want to repurpose this old rig as a standalone plex server (and possible blue iris backup) since the hardware is still solid and the processor supports quicksync for hw transcoding (I'll probably upgrade the ram, psu, and move from sata cards to HBA, but i digress...) Here's my conundrum though.\n Part of me really wants to transition from this shameful jbod array with ~36TB of media to a more modern and manageable Unraid setup... however I'd have to ditch my cloud backup. B2 storage for this amount of stuff is prohibitively expensive for just a plex server. However, if I stay jbod on a standard desktop operating system (macos/windows/linux) I can keep all my data backed up on backblaze's desktop plan for 7 bucks a month. \n Do I really need a cloud backup for this media? There's nothing I couldn't probably find on usenet if I had a major failure. Am I overthinking this? \n Please help me see reason and figure out what to do. I've been going back and forth all week.

I was thinking keeping them, but calculating for storage, backup and stuff, recently I'm about changing my mind. If I purge my library from unusable stuff, I'll have around some thousand pics instead of the 40k I currently have (from most of which aren't good), and I wouldn't need to be concerned about storage and backup for a while (reducing my 2TB of images to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-200GB, which I can totally support with the current home and cloud infrastructure I use (inc. kept raw files).\n What do you guys think? \n If there are any photographers/videographers here, what do you do with kind of useless material?

I have multiple HDDs and an SSD, but today an HDD I've used for around 5-6yrs started getting disconnected from my laptop with high frequency. And it was abysmally slow, the last time I checked it could only do 5mbps write when data wasn't being read/written to it in the background.\n I knew that the HDD was in its last legs, but I procrastinated over getting a new one just because I was naive and new to hoarding data. I quickly ran over to a store and bought a new 2TB WD HDD. \n Now I've spent a few hours trying to switch my data, but it shows an estimated time to copy of about 20-45mins for a 500-700mb file. If I kept this pace, it'd take me like a week to transfer everything over, and doing a transfer like that freezes Finder even when I'm trying to move and browse through files even on my laptops on board SSD. I know that the bottleneck here is just the fact that my HDD is old AF and there's not much I can do except just move the files over a long period of time. But I came here looking for something that could help me in future if not now.\n Is there any way to make this painfully slow process even a bit more efficient and quicker?

I've tried every combination of setting in the book and I can't get it to work.\n My config is 2XSSD 2-column mirror + 7XHDD 5-column parity on Win10 for Workstations. It sets up the tiers properly but then only allows the HDD tier to be used at 50% efficiency. Looking at individual disk IO I can see that it's striping only two disks instead of 5. Something seems to be forcing the config into mirror-mirror instead of mirror-parity.\n Please note that I'm talking about Storage Spaces, not Storage Spaces Direct. I've scoured the MS documentation and the internet and can't find any reference to Storage Spaces not supporting mirror-accelerated parity but it's Microsoft so who knows? Even MS tech support can't find a definitive answer for me as to whether Win 10/11 supports this.\n Have any of you ever gotten this setup working and, if so, how the hell did you manage it?\n Thanks!\n P.S. - And, with all due respect, please don't just suggest that I dump Storage Spaces and use some other product.

In the past I bought those Samsung SDD drives t5 and t7. These non brand ones are clearly made to look almost identical to Samsung one except to mention of Samsung. Their colors, their shapes, and printed text on look just like Samsungs except they are.\n I tend to believe that something that is too cheap and offers too much for much less is probably somehow compromised in quality.

          "description": "First of all, apologies if this is not particularly the appropriate subreddit for this post. I figured it might be worth a shot given the nature of the situation.\n I'm trying to digitise a small handful of VHS tapes. My original plan was to plug my VCR into the Xbox One via an AV-HDMI adapter/upscaler, and then use OneCast to connect from my computer and just do a screen cap. The problem now is that Microsoft have locked down the OneGuide app that takes in HDMI input and doesn't allow apps like OneCast to stream from that app anymore (same with apps like YouTube etc.). Maybe somebody knows of a different app that can capture an Xbox stream?\n Short of buying a capture card, are there any ways around this? Having a device in front of me with HDMI in and out, plus a 2-way AV-HDMI adapter, plus a VCR and a computer is making me think there has to be a solution with what I have.\n Again, I know the most obvious solution is \"buy a capture card\". I'm just trying to work with what I have at the moment. And if I do end up needing to purchase one, what would be your (budget) suggestions?

          "description": "I am a professional photographer (on the side, full time back end infrastructure engineer full time) and I have been thinking about reducing the impact of storing ~1Tb of RAW photos and/or video from each client project. \n My idea take inspiration from a (mostly) immutable backup project I am working on at work. Use tapes. To set the stage I am looking at this from a \"per-project\" standpoint not a \"backup my entire storage infra\" standpoint. \n I think would easily be able to fit a entire project (wedding, event, concert, etc...) on a single LTO-5 tape. With that I would double up and mirror the tapes and then just have them in a decent (but not great, admittedly) climate controlled environment for potential future access for up to 2-3 years after the project. So effectively I keep the \"good\" raw's and clips on my main storage array and then offload all of the project as a snapshot onto 2 identical tapes (original files, project files, and final exports).\n My goal is to reduce the spinning disks I need to maintain, decrease power usage, and decrese the space utilization of one off projects that I will likely never need to touch again, and still maintain that data for as long a possable for my own comfort and client good will. \n I am thinking I can find a LTO external SAS drive for ~$350, tapes for ~$9 per, and use something like bacula to manage the tapes.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/kd5vmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello,\n I have never archived any data before, and I think it's time to sort out my mess of hard drives before it's too late. \n I'm looking at archiving my photos, videos and university work to optical media. I'm unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.\n I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.\n The data I'm storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.\n I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it's worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.\n I'd appreciate any feedback on this topic. \n Many thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/carrot0202  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking to control around 20 SATA CD/DVD ROM drives, so port density and cost become important. Is anyone aware of similar boards - I really liked that the HPM-XU used a USB-B connector instead of the MicroUSB.\n I'm putting all of this into a dedicated enclosure, which will connect via USB to a PC or laptop. I'm specifically looking for solutions that do not require a host computer/bus (other than USB) but do have power within my enclosure to power drives and cards like the U3-QS3.\n FWIW - Most off the shelf cheap USB3 -> SATA cables appear to not support ATAPI.\n I'm not interested in building a dedicated computer to do this - I want a USB3 interface I can move around, and plug into multiple devices w/out having to bring anything else with me.\n    submitted by    /u/AudioHamsa  \n [link]   [comments]",

My telecine files for that 2.5 minute reel are typically about 85GB (6.5k resolution, HDR). As one does with analog film, long term preservation of the film itself and the original telecine files is important. I'm looking to burn these video files to BDXL MDISC and keep them offsite, to help support the 3-2-1 rule.\n Question: What is the best type of marker to use when labeling discs for long term archival storage? I know Sharpies are a no-no because they fade with time, but how about something like a Sakura Pigma Micron Pen, since they claim to be pigment based and archival in nature. Is something like that chemically safe to use with the MDISC without threat of damaging the disc over a long period of time?\n What do you recommend one uses?\n    submitted by    /u/Provia100F  \n [link]   [comments]",

The downside is I would not be able to add the drives to a ZFS pool when I purchase them down the line. I really like the idea of using Unraid but the USB thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about it.

Discord has replaced forums as a platform for exchanging information on specific topics. These forums are fortunately largely covered by e.g. the Wayback-Machine. The problem is that Discord is quite closed and can't be easily archived.\n ​\n How can the whole thing be done?\n Me and a friend have thought about something. We have developed a website and a discord bot. Every server admin can index his server with the bot. On Search-Cord.com you can search all messages in a few milliseconds. The usernames no longer contain #tags so that no users can be contacted against their will.\n The current state:\n Currently we have about 20 servers with a total of about 3 million messages archived?\n ​\n What about opensource?\n The complete source code can be found on Github.\n What if someone does not want their messages to be in the archive?\n On the website you can autentify yourself with discord and then delete all messages from the archive and put yourself on a blacklist to prevent future messages from being archived.\n    submitted by    /u/calvinwaran  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "My father was a big time record collector. He would literally skip meals for most of a week to have cash to buy a new vinyl record, as my mother tells it. He passed about 15 years ago, so his collection has sat dormant for awite awhile. One of his last gifts he got was a USB turntable. My brother doesn't want the records and I don't have the physical space. It seems that growing this collection was kind of his life mission. He would refer to anything non vinyl as \"Inferior music.\"\n My goal for now is to get his USB turntable, and rip every single album, so my brother and I can have our own little piece of the music my father sacrificed so much to afford. This will be a nightmare project. I ballpark at least 100 albums, and I'd be thoroughly unsurprised if it was closer to 200, and at a very conservative 30 minutes, that's 50 hours of ripping, at minimum. If I do this, I want to do this ONCE. I replace my hard drives every 4 years, and I know USB drives and SD/Micro SD are famous for short lifespans, so I'm looking for something we could keep for as long as possible. I'm not looking for huge storage capacity. Ripping direct WAV files, this should easily take up less than a TB. I want to be certain we could play these for as long as possible though. My brother isn't into music, and the music he is into he'll just go to YouTube for. I have no doubt he'll take the thing storing the music, throw it in a safe, and it'll never see the light of day again. Another reason that having a long term format is very important. It's going to sit there for a very, very long time.\n I'm considering Blu Ray-R discs, but there's probably something better for this task. I also don't have a Blu Ray drive, so that would add minimum $100 to the project. To those who are more informed about storage than me, any advice? What would you do in my shoes?

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm in the process of digitizing a large storage of paper documents. I have access to good office printers, so scanning most of the standard documents was a breeze. But I'm having issues with larger format documents. Especially paper rolls (so about 3-4m x 80cm wide), but also larger DIN A0 documents (e.g. Blueprints, plans, family trees, posters, etc.). I checked local services, but they can only handle DIN formats, but not the rolls. Do you guys have any ideas on how I could digitize them in somewhat good quality? I was thinking of taking lots of photos and stitching them with photomerge in Photoshop, but that failed quite badly. Are there maybe some scanner apps specialized for this, or are there any other techniques than I'm missing? Thanks for any help in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/corny96  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, I do regular backups of all of my devices, cards, and external drives, which a lot of the times includes tens of gigabytes of video footage (I do freelance videography work). I know I could most likely just delete all this footage after but as data hoarders understand, we would rather have a thorough archive of what we've shot, even if we'll never use the footage again.\n I've recently started using Handbrake to compress some of my archived footage which has been great - I have projects that had over 100GB of video footage in them and compressing the video files has literally halved the amount of storage space needed for those files. The only downside is, the compressed files are brand new files and the old still exist. So the only way I can actually benefit from this system is if I delete the old files, which I'm hesitant to do since those original files have all the \"created at\", \"modified at\", and other data associated with the actual original creation.\n What I'd love to be able to do is use some kind of tool or process to be able to delete these files but automatically replace them with a little data file that contains all that info. That way if I go looking for the files someday in the future and I navigate to the directory I know they should be in, I can see the files that were there plus all the original data from them, but it's just like a .txt file or something like that but which has the same name as the original file (different extension though obviously).\n Is anyone aware of something that does this or a workflow I could use to do it manually but in bulk? Any thoughts anyone has would be greatly appreciated! Cheers \n EDIT: Forgot to mention, I have both MacOS and Windows machines but usually my backup processes take place on Windows so looking for preferably a tool/process for Windows, but can make Mac work as well.\n    submitted by    /u/DoctorVanNostrandMD  \n [link]   [comments]",

I recently purchased a Mac mini M1 with 256GB internal space and 16GB of ram, and I'm looking to use it for school, music production and leisure - it will be my main desktop. Therefore, I am in need of some storage. My question to you all is, how much do I realistically need to invest in to future proof myself? I know this is subjective, so I've conjured up some rough estimates of how much storage I'd need for the different purposes, based on previous experiences and future wants to give you a better understanding, I suppose. Here they are:\n ​\n I'm thinking of getting an SSD (Samsung T7) with 2TB:\n ~300GB of Music Project Files on Logic Pro X and Ableton Live\n ~1TB of Audio Plugins / Instrument Libraries\n That's ~700GB to spare for other activities and such\n ​\n I'll also get an HDD for things that don't require a high read/write speed (I think?), my original idea was a 10TB WD Elements External Hard drive:\n ~2TB of TV-Shows\n ~1TB of Movies\n ~500GB of Music rips (from online purchases AND ripping my Vinyl-collection at some point)\n ~300GB of Audiobooks\n ~100GB of Comics\n ~50GB of eBooks\n That's ~6TB to spare, for now\n ​\n Is this a smart way to go about it, or is 6TB wayyyyy too much space to spare?

I of course don’t need shortcuts to programs that are only installed on one to appear on the desktop of another computer. \n Now if I keep the option to “sync” on on both of them, if I delete the shortcut on the wrong computer, it disappears from the other computer.\n Can anyone suggest a solution to bring it back to normal. I assume there is no function to “revert the sync” in OneDrive, so it seems I have to turn the sync off for both computers then sort out the files, then never to turn again.\n If anyone can give me any help and instructions how to do this or maybe how to keep the desktops backed up without something like this fiasco happening, please let me know.\n    submitted by    /u/SlothChunks  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm trying to get away from cloud services, mostly because it seems silly to pay to use someone else's computer to store our stuff. I was about to go back to an external hard drive when I learned about NAS options. I think this would work well for my needs, but I'm not tech saavy and have been struggling to understand what I would need and how to get it set up. I have Google Fiber in my home with two pucks.\n What hardware do I need? I'm under the impression I would need something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DS120j-DiskStation-Diskless-512MB/dp/B07ZKSLVT5?th=1\n And then I'd need an actual hard drive to go in it, right? \n How hard is the setup? Am I missing anything or is this just as simple as plugging into the google router and downloading the companion app on our phones/laptops? Are there any compatibility issues with different users running apple vs. android vs. windows, etc? \n Thank you for the help, and if this has all been answered elsewhere, feel free to redirect me.\n    submitted by    /u/Rlberger2  \n [link]   [comments]",

If there's a more relevant sub I should have posted on, please comment it!!\n So, the question is, is my SSD dying?\n Screenshot of the GSmartControl Attributes Page\n The last time I checked GSmartControl was about 1.5 years ago, and there were no pre-failure warnings and I don't recall \"old age\" messages either. I searched up things such as \"gsmartcontrol type,\" \"gsmartcontrol threshold,\" \"smart pre-failure\" etc., I even searched all of those terms inside of the GSmartControl wiki, yet I still don't really understand what they mean or if my drive is actually dying.\n ​\n Do any of you Storage Gods know if I should be worrying/panic-backing-up right now?

Does that sound right for a Seagate Ironwolf and a couple of dissimilarly-sized WD Reds? The Seagate spec sheets only list the 12V peak load and I'm unclear if I'm reading it correctly that the WD spec sheets are trying to communicate that the 12V and 5V rails have the same potential peak load.\n If at all possible, I'd also like to leave enough slack to swap in my brother's old GeForce GTX760 if my GTX750 dies before I'm ready to buy a new PC to swap my drives into.\n Can anyone provide clarity on the spec sheet side of things and is there a more suitable PSU calculator you would recommend?\n ...and if I am too close to the edge to pick up an Ironwolf Pro and a Red Pro on sale and a 2-port PCIe SATA card, would you advise a replacement PSU or can anyone suggest a trustworthy DC-DC voltage converter to supply them that shouldn't be too expensive to get a hold of in Canada?

Fired up the old 6-core AMD (it doesn't have AES support in the CPU) that I used to use as a daily driver - not expecting much. Fully expected the drives to be a loss.\n Won't boot. No signal on monitor... Hmm\n Figured out it was a RAM issue and now down to 8GB (2x4GB sticks.) Boots OK.\n Fire up old antix-16, ZFS is waaay back on 0.6.9-5 and the DE is fluxbox. LOL I was barebones back then, all the RAM went to ZFS and VMs.\n ​\n Fast forward, fast forward. Backed up my root filesystem, apt-get upgrade and Debian jessie is now at the latest package versions.\n ​\n Upgraded zfs from source to 0.8.6 and ran a scrub on both mirror pools. \n 0% damage, nothing to repair. \n SMART long tests passed on all drives tested so far.\n ​\n Now I normally would not recommend doing this, #1 you will screw yourself out of disk warranty - and normally I would spin things up every 1.5 years or so - but I plain did not have the space. Was able to recover some missing spreadsheet files from my old /home and will be using the disks till they die, it's a spare system at this point and will probably be off most of the time except for some nights and weekends.\n ​\n Just wanted to post a ZFS success story. Didn't have to make hashes or anything, ZFS handles it all internally. If you have some backup data that will be sitting for a while, put it on ZFS mirrors - it might last 3.5 - 4 years!\n    submitted by    /u/zfsbest  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello, today I bought WD Purple 4TB (WD42PURZ), a CMR drive with 256MB cache according to specs from WD. But I noticed this drive has trimming option for some reason. Trim on HDD's are used on SMR drives as far as I know. I've been writing random files of more than 1TB to the disk but it didn't slow down at all, it can't be an SMR drive. But when I researched, I didn't find anything related to trimming on CMR drives. I will share the datasheet from WD and a screenshot from CrystalDiskInfo:\n ​\n https://documents.westerndigital.com/content/dam/doc-library/en_us/assets/public/western-digital/product/internal-drives/wd-purple-hdd/product-brief-wd-purple-hdd.pdf\n ​\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/9fkhl6t2h7t91.png?width=663&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e61c0ee0f452b33f506cb6a391a9bde8b4bcc72\n Also this drive has 5040RPM compared to 5400RPM of WD40PURZ. Older PURZ models first came out in 2017, these newer ones with higher caches came out earlier this year. So does anyone know what's the deal with these newer Purple models and why they have trim option?\n    submitted by    /u/DarkOrion11  \n [link]   [comments]",

It amounts to less than 1TB so it's manageable, but I have two challenges.\n  \nTidy up all the music and get it into one location There are A LOT of duplicates. Some folders literally just have 3 or 4 of the same song in there named slightly different things. Other folders have a nice tidy set of albums complete with meta data. Is anyone aware of a tool that I could feed all these files into for it to scrape one of each song? He's really keen to not lose any of this as some of them are rare tracks he's collected over the years.\n \nTransfer onto a drive that he can access while away from home.

Now this has actually happened before and the controller tends to just flag the drives as Dead, as a precaution and I’ve always been able to force them to clear that status and just try again with a command line version of their utility, but this time that’s not working. The controller keeps returning an error saying it’s subsystem is locked, and it won’t respond to a SU level unlock command either. Wondering if anyone has had the same thing happen and if they managed to mount the array any other way? I’d even toss the drives in a PC tower with enough bays if there was a prescribed method for accessing a Promise array another way. \n Just evaluating options before I give the astronomical quote from the recovery company to my management lol! \n Oh and it was a six drive array in Raid5 and FOUR of the damn disks are affected. Oh yeah and it’s the main store for the last 3 months of shooting at my video company, despite me waving my arms at that four alarm fire for years.

My files are mostly movies and TV but I will backup more or less everything on it. I already have some redundant backup in the form of a 10tb and a 4tb.\n If I get the non pro ironwolf 5x 8TB it will cost me $925. Or $23 per TB. It also leaves me no empty bays. \n But if I get the Exos 16TB drives it will give me the same level of storage if I only get 3. Which will cost me $840 or $17.5 per TB. Which still leaves me 2 bays for expansion. \n All of these will leave me with 32TB of storage in a raid 5 setup. But everywhere I look it seems to suggest that the ironwolf is the cheaper solution and the exos is even more expensive than the pro ironwolfs. Which would still even cost me $60 more to get the 16TB pro Ironwolfs. \n So why is Exos listed as the more expensive and objectively better tier when it appears to be cheaper overall. Sure I won't get the same speeds as running 5 bays but eventually I could. \n Unless I am missing something here. \n Any input would be great. Also. I havent decided on a 5 bay enclosure yet.

Right now I have used about 85TB with my cloud storage provider and would like to have at least around 160TB in a RAID setup. The problem is, I really would prefer not to have to deal with potential HDD failures when I might have the option of using far more durable/dependable SSD's. I know the cost for 20 8TB SSD's is ridiculous, but beyond the cost...is it something that would be relatively easy to do? If not, I could buy 32 10TB HDD's for about half the cost. Thank you. Also, this is for media backup (UHD, BD and DVR backups).\n EDIT: Okay, it has been made clear to me 1.) That my fears of HDD failures were overblown and going full SSD would be a substantial overreaction and 2.) The cost is so much greater that I could actually replaced an entire array of HDD's multiple times for the cost the SSD array.\n    submitted by    /u/HoosierTrees  \n [link]   [comments]",
