With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don't care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.\n Now, I've installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it's really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. \n So my questions are: \n 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? \n 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).\n 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?\n 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?\n Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out.

TrueNAS Core running virtualized on one Proxmox node with local HBA and disks passed through. Total file storage is only around 5TB.\n Problem: TrueNAS Core is overkill for my current needs. The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can't take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.\n I'd like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I'm looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn't support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data. I've looked at openmediavault, Unraid, Ubuntu server, and stripped-down TrueNAS with a virtualized disk - but can't figure out which path to pursue. \n Hoping someone has been down a similar road and can offer advice.

All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I've been doing this for YEARS, but I've been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. \n All that to ask this....I've been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.\n I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.\n That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I'll just use my existing configs for it, but what I'm NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it's just using OpenVPN, but I'm not sure).\n Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?\n Ultimately, I'd like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don't limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode's IP my public IP.\n Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).\n Am I making this too complicated?

I can't find any near me\n \n Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me.

Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. \n I've considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I'm pretty sure cell towers are a bust. \n The nearest library is nice but it's only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. \n Am I stuck with Starbucks? \n I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things.

Mainly due to that I've learned to trust Asus mobos, it's got 2x Intel X710-AT2, ECC, IPMI, M.2 and is actually available. I'm likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I'm a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)\n - How's the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I'm aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I'll succeed with a 2U though.\n - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?\n - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense?

          "description": "So I've mounted my homelab and it is working great! \n The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I'm looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.\n I've got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they're lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/MadTiago  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?\n I've got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg\n Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better.

I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.\n Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this?

They're pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven't seen much use.

Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$.

          "description": "Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.\n I'm currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don't enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).\n From what I can decipher reading the interview:\n  \nThey're intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical's traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).\n Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned \"somewhere between\" Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there's currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.\n The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I'll leave it at that.\n  \nWhat I didn't see in the coverage (if I'm not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we're talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc's inorganic pitting \"secret sauce\" or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?\n I'd be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:\n  \nHow optimistic you are about this project?\n Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we're talking WORM) backup.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/danielrosehill  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you're familiar with his content, he's been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he's a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it's a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won't be around for long, since he's been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you've ever watched any of his content, you'd know he's extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I'm thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I'm looking at? Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/TCIE  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I'm thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.\n I've come across some comments like \"NAS isn't intended to be turned on/off\" or vague comments such as \"they aren't rated for that\" but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don't see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.\n Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.\n    submitted by    /u/seeminglyugly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.\n ​\n It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p\n I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.\n I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...\n But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. \n I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. \n Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?\n    submitted by    /u/Spam00r  \n [link]   [comments]",

Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into \" nsfw\" territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?\n We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Chaostheory0101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. \n I've found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. \n I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I'm working on periodically. \n I've had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them.

          "description": "I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was \"stored\" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)\n I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?\n Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.\n I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical\n (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Tomatillo5104  \n [link]   [comments]",
