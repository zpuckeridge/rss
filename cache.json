I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.\n I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say \"home.laxweasel\" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.\n I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.\n However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.\n Thoughts/experiences?

This meant that I had to regulate their times individually, and we can have up-to 5 children at a time from 7 to 14 years old at home.

I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.\n This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.\n    submitted by    /u/qwacko  \n [link]   [comments]",

It really just is a page displaying content about my business. Nothing fancy.\n ​\n 1). Should I host my website within a VM (on my local pc) or is there really no point / no security risk? Assuming that I only allow http(s) connections, there isn't much room for security concerns right?\n 2). What software do yall recommend for hosting? Reading the guides on this sub, I can't really decide between them, nothing stands out. I'm leaning towards apache because there seems to be quite a few YouTube guides for it and seems well documented.\n 3). Is there anything I should know before getting into this?

          "description": "Doing a little research on attempting to accomplish deploying a FOG server for backing up my OS installs (I distro hop quite a bit) so I can redeploy them easily if wanted. My environment is setup like this. I use Proxmox VE and have an AdGuard Home server deployed on it. My AGH server is my DHCP server as well. What I would like to do (or thinking what would be the route to take) is setup another interface on my PVE server for PXE booting and attach that and my LAN interface to my FOG server that I will build on my PVE server. Just not sure how to go about it and have PXE requests pull IPs from the FOG server and all other DHCP requests pull from AGH. Or is that even possible? Completely new to this and just playing it out in my head right now of how I see it working. Or, where and how to I configure AGH to work with the FOG server in that my nodes will be able to PXE boot to the FOG server without breaking normal DHCP functionality for normal operations. \n Thanks in advance for any and all direction on how to accomplish this.\n    submitted by    /u/MikePatton75  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.\n In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.\n Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).\n I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.\n TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise\n    submitted by    /u/DropkickFish  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.\n Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.\n However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).\n This is what I've tried so far:\n ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } \n }\n server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;\n server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server \"the-container-name\"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } \n } ```\n The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?\n I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.\n I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.\n Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.\n    submitted by    /u/detuneattune  \n [link]   [comments]",

I wound up doing it via Apple as it was easy to just send a link to everyone but I was wondering how a true self hoster would deal with this. I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. \n Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with. Uploading to photoprism via WebDAV is intuitive and works from phones or computers\n Feel free to ignore my options and just suggestion your own.\n    submitted by    /u/pulmonarypenguin16  \n [link]   [comments]",

Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.\n Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.\n Thanks a lot!\n    submitted by    /u/squirrelhoodie  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.\n Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.\n Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?\n Cheers\n    submitted by    /u/funfungo0dg0od  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "In a desperate attempt to move away from Adobe's photography subscription (I mainly used Lightroom Classic to organize my family photos on a NAS), I recently – and with the help of this sub – stumbled across Photoprism. I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. \n But there are a few basic things missing, like:\n - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata\n - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like \"turn image 90 degrees\")\n - simple file and folder operations like \"copy\" or \"move\"\n Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! \n But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. \n PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.\n    submitted by    /u/juekr  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So, my grandfather used to say \"before you start a job, make sure you have all the tools/parts\". I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.\n For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. \n Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.\n I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 \"trash can\" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).\n So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. \n A couple questions:\n What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?\n My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?\n I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).\n Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!\n Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.\n    submitted by    /u/docholoday  \n [link]   [comments]",

I also want to make this available for a few users that want to run \"test labs\". I know in Windows Server you can setup an RD Gateway and host a site to set a group of RDS servers for people to log into. Would that be the best way of doing it? I've set it up before, been a while, but can definitely do it again if that is the easiest way. But I would have to have RDS licensing for it. Was trying to avoid that part of it.

Using openvpn to my home network means that traffic is exposed to my home internet ISP. SO in this case I understand I could use a reverse proxy to solve it.

Would it be possible to host this reverse proxy on the same server that hosts my services? Is this advisable or am I better off with a premade solution from say cloudflare? I do have access to one of those free oracle cloud instances but I think the download bandwidth is capped pretty low on them, while upload is not, so it would probably run out of data acting as a tunnel for all of my data, streaming 4k movies or whatever.

          "description": "Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.\n The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.\n So the procedure:\n  \nCreate a new folder in your APP / Server, for example \"Mobile Photos\".\n Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload\n Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and \"Configure\".\n Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option \"The original file will....\".\n Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)\n Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.\n Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.\n  \nProblems:\n  \nFor some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.\n I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a \"Photo Folder\", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.\n  \nSo hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

We are looking for a system that can contain off of this.\n I am hoping to find a Self Hosted (hopefully FOSS) application that we can use as a CRM for our family. We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).\n My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.\n What I have looked at and dismissed:\n  \nHomechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.\n Monica - This is for tracking personal connections. While cool, not exactly what I am looking for.\n 'Real' CRMs - hubu, itflowly, salesforce, etc. These are just way to over the top and expensive\n  \n​\n Edit: A workable solution was determined so far, but still open to ideas: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ypt9hh/comment/ivm4mm6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n    submitted by    /u/webtron18  \n [link]   [comments]",

My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. \n So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). \n So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries. I ultimately end up with it all.\n    submitted by    /u/Unifi-Equipment-Noti  \n [link]   [comments]",

As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.\n I could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.\n I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...\n Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...\n I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:\n - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?\n - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.\n I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.\n Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?\n ​\n Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)\n    submitted by    /u/Biidouille  \n [link]   [comments]",

At worst, my VM is killed but it's no big deal.\n  \n​\n If I resume my idea, I want to add a layer (the VM) for better isolation between my public services and my NAS.\n Do you think it's secure enough for most attacks, or I shouldn't trust the VM isolation and buy a different physical machine?\n ​\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/grospoulet  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have searched all over and have not come up with even a partial solution that would be self-hosted.\n I live in a WISP environment (Wireless Internet Service Provider), which I have no control over the WiFi APs. My access to the outside world is through WiFi using a router in a wifi bridge mode; no Ethernet connections are available. The architecture of the WISP system, WPA2-Enterprise, allows other apartments to connect to the AP in my apartment which has several SSIDs. Every apartment has an AP in it and act similarly.\n What I am looking for is a Monitoring/Analytics solution which gathers continuous passive WiFi environment information over time such as WiFi slowdowns, WiFi outages, number of WiFi clients attached to an AP MAC address, signal levels, number of WiFi disconnects/reconnects, etc. This is similar to what could be obtained by using Kismet with a filter to gather real time statistics. I would also like to not run out of disk space over a week if at all possible.\n Does any solution for this problem exist? Or, alternatively, could something like this be cobbled together from existing self-hosted parts? Thanks for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/linuxweenie  \n [link]   [comments]",

They had both been working fine, but I borked my Nextcloud install so have started from scratch using NGINX as the webserver rather than Apache2. \n I used certbot to install a certificate for the internal domain (lets call it nc.internal.com for now), and it's working great on the local network. I want to use Cloudflare to make it available on the external domain (nc.external.com), so I've set up the DNS record for nc.external.com to point via my tunnel.\n However, whenever I enter nc.external.com into my browser I get the \"too many redirects\" error, and sure enough I can see lots of 301 Permanently Moved errors.\n My other apps are still working on thei external domains.\n I've tried changing the SSL/TLS settings in Cloudflare to every setting possible (Full (strict), Full, Flexible and Off), but these haven't helped.\n Wondering if anyone has any pointers or ideas?\n Kevin\n    submitted by    /u/captainkev76  \n [link]   [comments]",

I am also, unfortunately, at the intersection of \"worried about security\" and \"don't know enough to know what enough security is\". I really didn't like the fact that docker ignored my firewall rules and opened ports on the iptables, so I made a custom bridge network and didn't publish any ports. In this way, I had hoped to be able to solely publish ports 80 and 443, routing everything else through the custom docker network. This felt safer. The massive problem with this is that it works - kind of. I can generally get to a service, but not always. However, if I get to them, they will be intermittent at best. They drop a LOT of communications via time out. I tried netdata to see if the system was struggling - seems not at all. I took the services out of the bridge network and published the ports normally - everything works great. This makes me assume I did something wrong on the network.

But then, the *arr app may not find what I want, even tho I can go into prowlarr, manually search for it, and find it immediately. Why is that?\n Also, I have configured qbittorrent to do sequential downloads. That way I can see the Linux ISO form right in front of my eyes, byte by byte, which lets me enjoy it as soon as it begins downloading.\n The problem with that, is that the *arr apps won't move the file until it's completely finished downloading, so Jellyfin doesn't see it. I set up a workaround by adding qbit download folder to Jellyfin, and that works, and I can start watching immediatly, but it's wonky, and things aren't properly separated.\n Has someone done something similar?\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

The concept is, it only takes a millisecond or two to generate config files on the fly, so why not do that. Any important information, such as domain names and user names are stored in a single json file. I wrote a tool in rust which takes this information and inserts it into config templates. A single command installs the software, then the whole thing is already working.\n The web control panel is an optional package, and each service is also a separate package, you only install what you need. I wrote an install script with a menu to make it easy. The install script will also have an autonomous mode which can install the required packages without any interaction, which makes it easy to use with docker.\n I'm still working on the web control panel and a bunch more services. Currently I have dns hosting with named/bind, web hosting with nginx, haproxy, php-fpm, and lets encrypt, and email hosting using postfix. Websites are hosted each with an independent user and nginx instance. All this is configured automatically as each service starts. I'm working on adding support for hosting minecraft servers, managing backups and zfs pools, and other services as needed.\n Aside from a few bugs I'm still working on, my own use of the software has been smooth sailing. Hoping to continue work on it and make something great. The source code is currently private, while I still have some security concerns, but can grant access on request. I have faith in open source.

Using Radicale as a backend and Tasks.org as mobile app, everything works easily. I evaluate several solutions and this is the better one: Radicale is mature and updated, tasks.org connect to it without the need of DavX5 or other things. Very very good.\n Now, the problem is that the basic docker default config of Radicale does not have any kind of users management, in the login page you just insert a name (and no pwd, even if the field exists...) and if the username exists, you are enabled to see and manage (delete too) all its items; if it does not, a new user is created!\n As said I read some docs but I do not understand too much: I just need that users should have a password and that only users I authorize can login, so no automatic user creation. It seems I have to specify \"users list\" and \"users config file\" in the \"radicale config file\"; \"users config file\" details resources access for users.\n So, the question is: how have you solved this situation? Might you publish the config files you have? I just need 3-4 private calendars for family members and one shared.\n    submitted by    /u/wireless82  \n [link]   [comments]",

On the VPS are probably around 15 Things running.\n Anything that has a high reliability requirement and especially when it requires fast internet runs on my VPS. Currently it's a mess, things running with docker compose, things running with docker run (so the configuration is floating in space) and some things just barebone installed and running in some process managers or systemctl, messing with each other and breaking apt-get requirements.\n I'm planning to restructure everything into containerization, just unsure how. \n I have seen people use portainer (tried it, wasn't flashed), kubernetes (does that even make sense here? Sadly don't know a lot about it) or just plain docker-compose files and running commands.\n Is there some sort of guide/comparison that compares different approaches and their use cases. Would also be interested on the opinions of others, I'm really unsure about this.\n My time is fairly limited so I don't want to spend weeks trying different approaches or having to switch between them because something didn't work out.\n Thanks for any replies\n    submitted by    /u/stehen-geblieben  \n [link]   [comments]",

While also not leaving myself open to any attacks.\n I have an AWS EC2 instance up and running and have Wireguard running between it and my local network. To be more specific I have my local machine connected to the VPS. The VPS has iptables to move UDP traffic on both 16261 and 16262.\n I have also configured Traefik to forward the data to the correct server. I cannot seem to establish a connection to the game server. I have tested with both a VPN on my client to make sure I am connecting from the outside internet and without the VPN. In the diagram I want data to flow in via the blue line through all the respective connections. Then the red line out and back to the client so they can play on the server.\n I also realize that this can pose some latency issues and an inability to ban by IP. I really could care less about that. I want to mitigate DDoS or any form of attack that isn't based on an exploit in the game. If the game has an exploit then that is a whole other issue I will worry about. This is about minimizing the attack surface not the optimal way.\n https://preview.redd.it/vzjww5julex91.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6467aca37b9b897ff7388df2189779cf3f0b69c\n    submitted by    /u/IcyBlackAgeis  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've looked at a lot of the commonly recommended backup solutions (kopia, duplicity, duplicati, etc) and they all seem to require installation and configuration per server, so I'd have to set up and install on each server individually.\n Is there anything selfhosted (short of a cronjob + rsync script) that would allow me to backup multiple servers (all linux - mostly debian with a few raspberry pis) that is centrally managed?\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/themostevilchicken  \n [link]   [comments]",

External users should have read-only access to specific areas.\n a user database with own attributes per user and a simple user administration for technology beginners (e.g. Keycloak with a simpler user admin UI).\n email boxes that are easy to set up. An admin should simply say what name the mailbox should have and every allowed user (from the identity provider) should then have access via an email client. A ticket system is also welcome.\n a file storage (e.g. Nextcloud).\n a wiki.\n a registration form for events. The price may vary per pre-selection.\n  \n​\n The requirements are as follows:\n  \nwe have a little more than 1000 members. Each member should have their own account, which in the best case should already exist and must be provided with a password when logging in for the first time. We already have the e-mail addresses and other information in an Excel spreadsheet.\n security: if possible at least password policies and/or two-factor authentication. If the new passkeys feature is already supported, that would be even better. Also, users should be able to be logged out of all services immediately. It should also be possible for our chairperson (over 60) to assign roles to services.\n if an e-mail, name or any other attribute changes in the identity provider, this should also be changed on all other systems as soon as possible.\n  \n​\n I know C# and web development with PHP well, so I could also write smaller plugins myself.

My question:\n  \nCan an Amazon FireStick access USB storage attached to the TV? I tried installing ES File Explorer (which supports FTP) but it only sees the FireStick's internal storage.\n \nMy Samsung TV is UE40H6400 and it seems I can not connect to the Samsung servers, I'm assuming because the TV is out of support. Does anyone know where I can find a list of .apk packages that are supported on this TV? If I can install (for example) ES File Explorer on the TV instead of on the FireStick, I'm assuming that the external storage attached to the TV will appear as accessible.\n \nIs there a better way to do this? I just want to avoid having to go through the whole process of connecting my external storage to my PC, moving media to it, disconnecting and reconnecting to TV, playing the media, disconnecting and reconnecting to PC... and so on each time I want to watch something not from a streaming service.

It could be done each 1 hour or something like that.\n I would like to have this kind of monitor because I have had 2 issues in the server (one related to a Postfix update, and other one related to certificates) and I didn't get any alarm... so the issues produced mail delivery failures during some days until I noticed the mail were not working :-(\n Is there any service which could help me? \n Thanks in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/yvoictra  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think the end goal is for me to self-host 'something', I'm just not sure what it would be. \n I work from home, and my wife is a stay at home mother. We have a family calendar via iCloud, and I obviously have a work calendar (I am in lots of meetings) that I can't share with her. \n I'm trying to find a way for her to schedule personal appointments (where I'd need to watch the baby while she's gone) but make sure it's not done during existing meeting I have at work. \n Right now I've tried blocking off 2 x 3 hour windows each week, but that's not really feasible as they mostly go unused by her, and I need to be able to schedule calls during them. \n So I need to find some way to either anonymize my work meetings and upload them to a shared calendar so she can figure out when 'not' to schedule her appointments, or find a way so the appointments she schedules for herself end up on my work calendar. \n I've got the ability to self host anything I need to to help make this happen, I'm just not sure if such a thing is even possible, let alone what products/technologies I might need to pull it off.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a single host (10.1.10.10) running 20+ docker containers. One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). \n Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The \"internal\" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). \n Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. \n My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. \n Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes. Any ideas? \n Thanks for the help.\n    submitted by    /u/Jyncus  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has an USB-HID connector on the back which is currently connected to my Synology DS216. I set up the UPS via DSM and it seems to be working fine. But now i'd like to connect also my Proxox server. As it seems i have the following options\n Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud\n I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.\n I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my \"server\".\n What do you think?

I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.\n I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.\n I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:\n  \nMedia Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.\n An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.\n If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.\n Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)\n  \nIt does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/Kayfabe10  \n [link]   [comments]",

Not sure what to call it, but something to keep track of who gave us what so that we can send out thank-yous\n Simple website to display travel instructions, FAQs, etc\n Photo Uploader - An app or website where guests can upload photos to a shared folder that we can access. I might set up another instance of nextcloud with anonymous uploads just for this, unless there is something better?\n Photo Gallery - For after the wedding if we want to share photos.\n \nContacts updater - For people who we don't have contact info for, we'd send them a link to some sort of form for them to provide their mailing address. Worst case we can probably use google forms for this.\n  \nI have a few ideas for some of these things, but would appreciate any ideas everyone has!

          "description": "I have a jam-band lover on my holiday gift-giving list, and I'm thinking of doing a substantial download (~4TB) from bt.etree.org over the next couple months, and giving it to him on some easy-to-use device. The simplest would just be HDD, but I don't think he actually has any type of local media server (like not even iTunes on a PC). So, my question is:\n Is there something like a vendor NAS OS that would:\n  \nProvide an SMB service so he can connect the music to Sonos\n Possibly host Jellyfin/Plex/ other audio-specific media server\n Give him access to a BT client so he can continue to grow his library\n Keep itself reasonable up-to-date and secure\n  \nI'm familiar with a DIY solution, but this needs to be more of an appliance than a hobby unto itself. Part of the gift would be opening the door to the contemporary bittorrent version of the 'taper/trader' jam band scene.\n Any tips would be awesome, thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/ashooner  \n [link]   [comments]",

At work we have a lab that was setup before I started and they manually install vsphere/k8s(rancher) with out of tree management. This allows for spinning up VMs to be used as part of the cluster from rancher.\n However I noticed that rancher is spun up in a k8s cluster that is formed insider a docker container.\n IE docker-run->k8s cluster generated->rancher installed. This is a one liner from rancher for development testing. Then we have downstream clusters spun up inside vsphere via ranchers GUI.\n The reason for all this is \"Cloud Agnostic\", so we're not using a managed k8s service AKS/EKS etc.\n Anyway I was setting up a new home lab before I had an old r710 server with proxmox and did a lot of manual configuration, vm creation not fun.\n My new setup is 3 dell thin clients with proxmox all joined to a DC. Now aside from manually installing proxmox which I could've automated with PXE boot *I plan on testing PXE boot deploys now that I have proxmox setup*. I'd prefer not to be manually spinning up containers I know portainer is a popular tool for this but I'm considering a k8s enviroment. \n What's your go to method for bootstrapping k8s? I know k8s is overkill for self-hosted but it's what's used at work so I'd like to make it more part of my daily.\n    submitted by    /u/sorieus  \n [link]   [comments]",

I stopped hosting in 2015 because I moved to a location with no broadband internet and the best solution I had was a tethered cell phone with terrible speed and CGNAT. Now I have T-mobile unlimited home internet with 130-230 down and 20-35 up. So I have the speed for it, but still no port forwarding.\n Now here are the solutions and resources research has pointed out to me. Just curious which of them are better choices in current times. I will be hosting multiple VM's/containers including plex to a few users for music and occasional video. Also hosting cloud storage for a few cell phones to store photos and videos for freeing up local storage on devices. And home assistant which I currently pay the cloud fee for and that cost can go towards a more global solution\n ngrok - already using the free one of this for plex which is great. Wish the paid version was priced down a little more, but still open to it.\n cloudflare - looks very popular and similar to ngrok and priced similar.\n localXpose - have not tried but looks similar to ngrok, but more affordable.\n portmap io - looks to be like the above but uses openvpn to which I could setup on my router directly.\n openvpn to a friend/family router to use there ipv4 port forwarding and free DDNS - This is probably what I would have done years ago before the tunneling solutions above became mainstream. Honestly still open to this too though.\n VPS with VPN - have only lightly researched this one. Was going to test on my free AWS account, but read that it gets expensive if much data is uses across AWS, so would need a cheaper host.\n unknown - A wiser choice I am overlooking?\n    submitted by    /u/dominatorstang  \n [link]   [comments]",

The plugin was recently archived on Github, but I tried the same version from the most recent release along with the version of Mattermost that would have been the most recent at the time, and I am having the same problem as the person does in this Issue thread (The heading of the voice channel area appears, but the actual channels do not populate).\n I am running Debian 10 on Digital Ocean, and PostgreSQL (I didn't think the db mattered, but I had never heard of that, and I only used it because I was following along someone else's instructions and they used it, so I thought I'd mention that).\n https://i.imgur.com/3XleCd1.png\n The solution that worked for the issue I posted above was that they had to add the listen port into the setting for the site URL. I opened this port, and I tried all combinations of versions of the Mattermost client + plugin, with and without this port in the URL, HTTP and HTTPS, and I am losing my mind not knowing what else to try. I am very new to Linux and very new to server configurations, so I just don't even know where to begin troubleshooting. Only now as I type this I realize that I never tried to downgrade the server, which could work.... If anyone has any tips on doing this with as little damage as possible, I would love the words of advice. \n Also, the log file does not appear to have anything terribly helpful or out of place. It all looks to be loading the modules as normal with no issues. There are a ton of log files in my Mattermost folder, if there is a specific one I should focus on for this and look more closely at, please share.\n Or if anything jumps out at you that I could try before I downgrade the server, that would be great as well.\n    submitted by    /u/pensivetomatillo  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've been thinking of migrating Plex to this RHEL9 rig. What are the pros and cons of running Plex on Linux as a native RPM package vs a podman container? Some people report trouble getting NVIDIA hardware acceleration to work with Podman, but looking at various instructions it doesn't seem THAT hard (although obviously a fair bit more involved than just having NVIDIA drivers installed).\n What about the required NVIDIA container runtime, does it essentially replace the runtime provided by Podman or does it only affect containers specifically utilizing NVIDIA hardware? How well supported things are, is it safe to just have the system automatically update all OS updates + NVIDIA drivers (DKMS) + NVIDIA container-related packages?\n    submitted by    /u/-quakeguy-  \n [link]   [comments]",

So, I decided to fork Guide2go and add the features that, I believe, were missing.\n So far, I added:\n — The EPG guide includes a Live/New icon for premiere shows and movies. Guide2Go does this natively, however, players like Titivate won't read XML tags. This solves that problem.\n — Added an EPG server. Now, Guide2Go will grab images from SD and act as a server for those images; it will download the images and cache them locally to avoid kill calling SD API. This is very useful for clients like Plex or Emby. Very similar to what 123EPG does (Actually, not similar, but the same feature).\n — Added the option to not download the images locally, but to call SD API every time a client needs an image. This is useful if you only have one or two clients with few EPG days downloaded. If you have many channels, this will not work for you. SD has a limit in the number of images that can be downloaded directly.\n ​\n I accept constructive criticism in the Code, I am not a developer by any means.

If I create a 'Trash' folder by mounting a new share from my NAS GUI, then it resolves the 500 internal area.

We do many things including computer repair(even board level repair), software troubleshooting, etc. While we have a fair number of residential customers, we've also got a number of commercial clients for whom we do not only the aforementioned, but also managed backups. A typical client setup would be a Synology Diskstation to match their needs along with a Synology C2 cloud account. We have their workstations use Synology's 'Active Backup for Business' which will backup workstations on our schedule with whichever backup scheme we set up. The NAS itself will use Synology's 'Hyper Backup' to then back itself up to the Synology C2 cloud storage - whew... that's a lot of Synology stuff, and I rather dislike that.\n I'd rather have something less monolithic in the event Synology changes something down the road(for example pricing), forcing me to change gears. Given the above use case, what would be your go-to setup?\n Follow-up question: In my office, I too use a Synology DS, and with that I also use the Synology Office productivity suite which I would describe as 'decent, but no Google Docs'.

I also searched using HaProxy on pfsense to balance between the servers and then traefik to handle the subdomains after that but only found one thing and it was to not do it. I also looked into cloudflare tunnels but seems like it’s not really ideal. I’m not doing anything media streaming with the domain so would that still be an option?\n Is this even possible? Where can I find a guide in order to set it up if it is? I just want to be able to have more specific domains than anything. Don’t want to mix a family domain with something a client may type in.

I love the dummies guides (check them out here) I have multiple of them myself and I love the style of them. Plain in language and simple to follow.\n Now the first one i've written assumes you have basic linux skills (creating files etc) but I am working on a docker & portainer guide soon along with a few others in the basics range.\n Today I'd like to launch with Matrix and Element.\n https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/002-matrix/\n I welcome any feedback and also looking for contributors too who are interested as I am in writing really simple guides for anyone and everyone.\n My list so far being made (some are already in draft)\n  \nAuthentik\n Nginx Proxy Manager\n *arr groups\n Portainer\n Hugo + Umami\n Actual\n Invidious\n Vaultwarden & Bitwarden\n  \nI am also planning to have some business focused ones so stay tuned for those.\n Thank you all for a great community, truly be enjoyable part of my day hearing new to the hobby making great things.\n    submitted by    /u/QuantumNow  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi /r/selfhosted, I just wanted to gather some opinions regarding removing Nextcloud from my home server and replacing it with a few other services. The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.\n I've been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:\n - SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV's transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn't deal very well with large files, but I'm not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.\n - Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.\n - Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64. \n The goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server. Does that make any sense or is that an overly elaborate solution that will not provide any real improvement?\n    submitted by    /u/avnoui  \n [link]   [comments]",

So I was wondering if there was a way where as soon as my phone connects to my home network, it triggers my Mac to backup my iPhone over the network and have it store the backup files on my server. Is then even possible? Is there a docker container that can emulate a networked Mac with iTunes for me? Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I couldn’t find anything on google.\n    submitted by    /u/intel-gma-950  \n [link]   [comments]",

Then after like 5 upgrades in, I kept getting a different error about my db not being connected even though it was running and listening so I just ended up rolling back to before I started doing upgrades. Great waste of time. \n I dont care for all the apps. I dont need a cms. Im the only one who uses the instance so a chat feature doesnt do too much for me.\n The only functionality I care about is cloud storage for my photos and videos and privileged account access. I like how theres an android app. I like how the android app has auto upload. I like having a web UI. I like having a trash can in case I want to restore something I deleted. \n The last ~4 days I've been having issues with the android app crashing and I tried to upgrade my NC since Im on V22 but got all kinds of errors and had to rollback. \n The other day I downloaded a different app called fireshare. I love the UI there and I love how snappy and responsive and quick it is. I uploaded an 80mb video to it while I was testign it out and the video buffered instantly. No stuttering. The same video on NC would play for 10 seconds then pause and buffer and the whole app will freeze up when I try to click play. \n If someone took whatever engine is running that and repurposed it for cloud photo and video storage + android auto syncing then it would be perfect.\n I see a lot of people complain about nextcloud on this subreddit all the time.

          "description": "Some more context: I have an external USB hard drive connected to my home server (an old laptop). On most days, the drive is only active for short bursts (either media consumption or nightly borg backups). I assume this kind of usage pattern is very common in the community.\n I've noticed that the drive never spins down by default and makes quite a bit of noise, which prompted me to look into hard drive spin down with utilities such as hdparm (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/hdparm). In my case, I changed the APM (Advanced Power Management) setting from its default value of 128 to 64 which reliably spins the drive down shortly after the burst of activity (as verified by ear and smartctl -i -n standby /dev/sdX). Great – less noise, heat, and (hopefully) power consumption! Now my question is the following:\n Do you let your idle hard drives spin down? Does spin down actually increase the longevity of the drive (with a similar usage pattern)?\n I'd be super happy to hear what other self-hosters do and if you could point me to a reliable resource for further reading.

Could swear I remember seeing a post within the last 6 months with recommendations other than Moodle but maybe I was dreaming as I can't find it anymore.\n So, Moodle doesn't seem to list some actual features that I am interested in (okay well it does but not all of them, or maybe it's assumed I already know). I already have Plex btw, and I really don't want to use that for online learning course material.\n The features I am looking for, in something kind of light weight are:\n - Multi user support\n - Video support (I have videos on a NAS, if I serve up an NFS directory, can I sort those videos on the LMS into the correct courses - like Plex, let me make a library)\n - File upload for course materials and PDFs etc - if PDF could be rendered in browser that'd be pretty sweet\n - But not only video streaming in a browser, but also audio stream too\n - Course completion meter and tracking (like, I've done 50% of the course etc)\n - Course tagging\n Thanks everyone! :)\n    submitted by    /u/zirophyz  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem is, the specs aren't the best and if I don't get a RAM upgrade a VM for every service isn't gonna be an option. I want to isolate them as much as possible for security purposes though. I also want the experience of setting everything up by myself, not just download a Docker image and install it, as I think that's the most fun part. What should I do? I'm currently running a proxmox and my vyos router VM on it and I thought about adding qbittorrent and nextcloud, although I will probably hit my 8GB RAM limit soon. So, what should I do?\n    submitted by    /u/alinastraz  \n [link]   [comments]",

When I port forward the port, I do get connectable (as per the connection status symbol).\n But now my other port forwarding rules, 80 and 443 which my reverse proxy uses are having connection issues. Often when trying to remotely access my services using port 443, I get time out issues and connection is not possible. This will always start working again just as I remove the qbittorent port forward rule in my router settings.\n Seems I can only have one of these services' ports open at the time, and never at the same time. Both services are on same device, and on the same docker network. My router port forwarding rules point to my server and the correct IP. No other service is using the torrent listening port. Any tips?\n If anyone stumbles upon this later. The fix was to disable the \"dos protection\" feature on my Asus router. I think the amount of udp requests created from making my torrents connectable triggered the alert on a possible dos attack. Lol.\n    submitted by    /u/Filigott  \n [link]   [comments]",

My job is called \"Site Reliability Engineering\", some folks call it \"DevOps\". \n Two years ago, during lockdown, I started making \"DevOps From Scratch\" videos to help beginners get into the field of DevOps. At that time, I was interviewing lots of candidates and many of them lacked fundamentals due to most of them focusing on these new technologies like \"Cloud\", \"kubernetes\" etc., so I was mostly focusing on those fundamentals with these videos, and how everything fits together. \n I realize that this will be helpful to at least some new folks around here. If you are an absolute beginner, of course I would recommend you watch from the beginning, but feel free to look around and find something you are interested in. I have many videos dealing with basics of Linux, managing domains, SSL, Nginx reverse proxy, WordPress etc to name a few.\n Here is the landing page : https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/\n Direct link to the Youtube Playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxYCgfC5WpnsAg5LddfjlidAHJNqRUN14\n ​\n Please note that I did not make this to make any money and I have no prior experience making youtube videos or talking to a public channel, and English is not my native language. So, please excuse the quality of the initial videos (I believe I improved a bit in the later videos though :) ) \n Note: If you see any ads in the video, I did not enable it, it's probably YouTube forcing it on the videos, I encourage you to use an adblocker to watch these videos.\n    submitted by    /u/m4nz  \n [link]   [comments]",

When you create a booking page on Cal.com, other people can use the page to make an appointment with you, and a new event will be added to a CalDAV calendar you specify. In fact, Cal.com can integrate with multiple calendars to help you let people book appointments while avoiding conflicts. Handy!\n However, there are some calendars I would like Cal.com to use for conflict avoidance that are published as .ics URLs only. And right now Cal.com can't subscribe to .ics feeds.\n My first attempt was to use my Nextcloud instance to subscribe to the .ics feed, then have Cal.com access my Nextcloud calendars via CalDAV. Unfortunately, Cal.com can only see CalDAV calendars that live directly in my Nextcloud instead of the .ics feed it subscribes to.\n Is there another intermediary CalDAV server that can subscribe to .ics feeds and exposes them as a read-only CalDAV calendars so that Cal.com can see them? Of course, the CalDAV server needs to refresh the .ics subscriptions frequently to reflect the latest updates.\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/avamk  \n [link]   [comments]",

My plan is to pay for a cheap VPS, and have my home server establish a tunnel to this, and let the VPS forward all traffic through the tunnel to my home server.\n At first, it seemed like a reverse SSH tunnel was what I was looking for. But reading up on it, SSH tunnels only seem to support TCP. While I found some workarounds this seems to complicate things unnecessarily.\n After some more research I found rathole which seems to do exactly what I need.\n Does anyone have any experience with this?\n Ideally I would like to use rathole to forward traffic from the VPS to my home server in order to establish a VPN connection through wireguard.\n This seems to be the right tool for the job.

This motivates us to localize and tailor the sign-in process even more.\n Now, we're ecstatic to announce that Logto Sign-in Experience has full support for i18n, which means your products can reach a wider global audience and offer more personalized and contextualized options for all users.\n  \nWe have 6 predefined languages to choose from, all of which were created by our international community and can be modified to your liking.\n \nSupport for up to 113 language tags, allowing you to use your own translation in order to reach the vast majority of countries worldwide.\n \n The admin console already includes this functionality. The \"Language\" section in \"Others\" tab of the Sign-in Experience page is where you'll be able to rapidly set up and manage your keys and custom values.\n CLI: Exclusively for Logto\n Combating with complicated commands? That's not how we roll. So we're bringing some friendly little things to keep the elegance going even in the command line.\n If you're trying to install Logto on your machine, skip the long, scary install command. It now reads:\n bash npm init @logto \n And you are all set. Check out Using CLI for a detailed explanation of how to use Logto CLI.\n    submitted by    /u/Formal_Tree2535  \n [link]   [comments]",

The server could host the keepass db or other files. Downside, after, let's say a flooding, it might takes weeks before I would care about accessing my servers again. There is a chance that I'll even forget the combination.\n Public cloud, gdrive, more or less similar to gist / pastebin.\n Hosting the keepass db files itself, seems to insecure to me, even if my passphrase has 30 characters. Someone could just download it and use high powered brute force to crack it.\n Another idea would be a second keepass db on a public cloud, with a private ssh key and only hints, that would help me remember, but not give anything away.\n    submitted by    /u/Mean_Einstein  \n [link]   [comments]",

The sorting of these is a work-in-progress after a massive scanning session, and now the documents are sitting in a network share. Some are nicely named and live in a sensible folder structure, and a lot aren't - at least for the moment.\n I had considered using Paperless-ngx as a way to use automated tagging and OCR to make searching for things easier in the future. However, I believe that Paperless-ngx works by consuming documents within an 'import' directory, and from that point on the document will live within the docker container. This doesn't seem great to me as I'd rather have full control of the document locations.\n Am I correct in my thinking? I was wondering if there's a document system that works similar to how PhotoPrism works: point it at a directory and let it chew over everything there, writing tags and other information to its own database while leaving the original files untouched.\n ​\n Thanks in advance for any wisdom shared.\n    submitted by    /u/WhatAGoodDoggy  \n [link]   [comments]",

You only have to login to authentik once, and then just grant the applications access when you login to them. \n LDAP should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't have 2fa and is quite an old protocol, so I suggest using it only when an app doesn't support other options. \n Proxy auth also displays the login portal, but it works on the reverse proxy level, so reverse proxy forwards requests to authentik, which makes sure the user is authenticated. Authentik then forwards the requests to the app, with a special header with the username. This option is best for static/single page/single-user apps, but not ideal for most of them as it will break mobile apps and some APIs due to it's low level nature. Some apps have explicit support for proxy auth and work just as well with it as some do with OpenID. \n Authentik docs have per-app instructions which show the recommended way to set it up.\n    submitted by    /u/dada513  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi everyone, I'm interested to hear what kind of security and monitoring measures you all use for your servers and the services that you're self-hosting.\n My approach isn't very extensive so I'm looking for areas where I could make some improvements. So far it's:\n  \nTighten SSH \n Use SSH keys for authentication\n Disable root login\n Change the default port for SSH connections\n Tweak some of the miscellaneous settings in sshd_config\n \n Use fail2ban\n Use Cloudflare (DDoS protection features, caching reduces load on origin server, hide origin server for DNS entries)\n Deploy apps dockerised when possible\n Use NGINX as my web server/reverse proxy \n Force HTTPS connections\n Use NGINX authentication for services\n \n Use a password manager to generate strong credentials for every service/account.\n  \nSome things which I'm looking to add in the future are:\n  \nA backup solution for logs and other important files, on a daily basis\n An extra layer of authentication via Authelia or something similar\n Remote access for sensitive apps via a Wireguard tunnel (though this isn't something I need, at least for now)\n Find some kind of monitoring solution for app and server logs\n Find a Intrusion Detection System to use but I don't know if this is overkill?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/omermikhailk  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a WireGuard VPN, Nextcloud and a 3D Printer with web frontend set up and I would (ideally) like access to all under one domain, even from outside the local network. I already have a DynDNS provider set up, so the WireGuard traffic is routed consistently even with changing public IPs. However, I can not directly access for example nextcloud under that domain, since only my custom WireGuard port is exposed.\n Currently, I do have access to everything even from the outside, but I have to type the IPs in the VPN of the respective server to access it.

I've decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I'm having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.\n Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver's docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:\n version: \"3\" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 \n I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let's Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:\n Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server's IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes \n When creating a new SSL certificate:\n - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains \n All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed\n The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I've set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I'm unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I'm completely out of ideas.\n    submitted by    /u/Sigma-Alpha_2  \n [link]   [comments]",

As many are complaining about these USB docks buying an old 1U disk rack on eBay. There’s so many options on eBay that I need someone kind enough to point me on the right product. Obviously there’s no 1U disk rack which can be connected via USB so it will be Ethernet and as far as I understood these have a CPU which means a OS so are file servers (correct me if I’m wrong).

The font wasn't working and it came with this ugly serif font instead, however weirdly enough it displayed the font when Portainer wasn't accessed behind my reverse proxy\n With lots of googling I've managed to fix it to allow the font to load behind the reverse proxy!\n In your nginx reverse proxy security config under \"add_header Content-Security-Policy\", add the following \"font-src * data: blob 'unsafe-inline';\"\n For me, because I use OpenMediaVault this config file was located under /etc/nginx/openmediavault-webgui.d/security.conf, however varying on your setup you might find the CSP line in another file!\n Just thought I'd make this post in case anyone else ran into this issue, as I couldn't find anything similar on reddit quickly & easily.

In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.\n I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.\n I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.\n So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?\n I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.\n Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?\n The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don't have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI's or something like that.\n    submitted by    /u/SmoothLiquidation  \n [link]   [comments]",

Concurrent access of all users is very unlikely. at most 5-10 people will use the services regularily at any given time\n Nothing's set in stone so far except for software. Drive space requirement > 500GB\n I'd like to use \n  \nOpenProject (used on a Synology DS via Docker before) for project management and scheduling of tasks\n \nNextcloud for file sharing (integrated in OP)\n \nsynapse / matrix to channel user available chat apps on one single platform.\n \n I have three options for hardware:\n  \nSynology DS with an Atom C3853, 32GB ECC RAM (but slow internet access)\n \nIntel NUC with Celeron J4005, 4GB of DDR4 (can be upgraded to 8GB and relocated for faster internet access)\n \nor investing ~400$ in a new Odroid H3 / H3+ , 16GB RAM and 2 SSDs for RAID 1 (moved somewhere else for fast internet)\n \n All services must run through a VPN tunnel, so a VPN server would have to be hosted on the machine, too.\n  \nThe cheapest and easiest solution is def using the NUC but I am not sure whether the J4005 can manage at least those 3 services within docker / portainer.\n \nThe Synology has a faster CPU and tons of RAM and HDD space but cannot be relocated somewhere else for faster internet.\n \nThe Odroid H3 / H3+ has by far the best CPU and offers M.2 and 2x SATA for internal Raid 1 but means a bigger investment.\n \n What would you recommend and why?\n Thank you!\n    submitted by    /u/mironicalValue  \n [link]   [comments]",

The thing is, if it could run Plex in good condition as how it’s now, or should I install some older version of Windows, or even should I install another dedicated server OS to run my media stuff (video and music) and maybe as a file backup too, but hopefully with an easy remote access tool. Plex is really flexible and simple because I can play my stuff on my chromcast and managing in the web app too.\n So that’s the question, should I keep the windows 10 version and install Plex server, or should I use other OS and/or Media server APP?.\n Thanks in advance :)\n    submitted by    /u/Puchacamilo  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "For this Christmas i want to do a little upgrade to my node 804 mini server. Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.\n CPU: AMD 5600X\n Desired setup:\n  \n2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0\n 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.\n 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot\n 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.\n  \nDrive quantity:\n  \n8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.\n 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.\n 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.\n  \nSo the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.\n I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.\n Thanks a lot for any guidance!\n    submitted by    /u/thinkyougotmewrong  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.\n I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.\n I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?\n Is it also worth looking into other file systems? I just use normal ext4, but I've heard people talk about using ZFS instead, but I don't know much about it.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/ElnuDev  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.\n So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .\n But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :\n https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms\n Or you could go back to X86.\n Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.\n You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.\n Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for \"pfsense router\".\n ​\n https://preview.redd.it/841ft3v2ckz91.png?width=1393&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac555579191683e56468092b6d1fefd7c4fea74\n This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. \n What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.\n    submitted by    /u/EspurrStare  \n [link]   [comments]",

It has yet to be addressed.\n Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.\n In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:\n  \nThe UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.\n The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.\n  \nI'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.\n Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.\n    submitted by    /u/curlybrian  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.\n Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.\n My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):\n https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US\n I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.\n Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?\n    submitted by    /u/Vchat20  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey HomeLabers... HomieLabbers? HomeboyLovers?\n Anyway, I want to build a new home server. My current is an old gaming PC; AsusMobo, AMDfx, 16GB.DDR3, and GTX 780 running on Proxmox as a single server. \n I'm thinking I can use Pi4s instead of getting new mobo, AM4 and DDR4. I'm new to cluster/stack so my original idea is that I setup a kube environment and run VMs on top, but I don't think that would work. (If I only run server images using docker engine without the need of GUI maybe) So my revised plan is installing Proxmox to each Pi4 node creating a Proxmox cluster.\n My only reason for this is thst I can chuck as many PI4s inside a full ATX case minimizing heat and power consumption. I live in a shared appt so my current is acutally inside my room.\n Have anyone done this before?\n    submitted by    /u/theONLYhotpotato  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I dealt with this on another server and it was a massive headache, just looking for some advice from anyone who had a better experience.\n I have OMV running on a Dell R710, customized to my use, where I have Snapraid and UnionFS running as my raid within OMV. I have this setup over 6 drives for parity but all 6 drive bays are full. I want to swap one of my data drives, as well as the parity, with 2 new 12TB drives which gives me parity for my (now) largest drive of 12TB as well as some more usable data as my existing drives are all 4TB.\n What's the absolutely most safe and simple way to do this? I have Rsync running with google workspace for cloud storage which can also be used as a transfer spot if needed, but I'm thinking there has to be a more simple way than I'm seeing.\n ​\n TIA\n    submitted by    /u/FourTimesRadical  \n [link]   [comments]",

I already have a VMware esxi server on a Dell r720 and a Plex server with 28TB on a old i5 6600K running all the ARRs as well (thinking of moving these to Docker, right now they're local installs). I had a 240gb and a 1TB SSD laying around. I installed Truenas on the 240gb. I noticed that I can't do anything with the excess space. So I wonder if is there a better way to run it. I hate wasting space I have several 1TB 2.5 SSDs laying around from various projects over the years I thought about buying a SATA card to run them off of too and use the 240 as a cache drive for the mechanicals. \n What would be the best most efficient way to use TrueNAS? Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way?

The power consumption is low, for all power supplies and the server it is about 120 Watt.\n If I would connect a UPS (Eaton USV Ellipse ECO 800 USB DIN for example) to my small homelab server and the power supplies the breaker problem should be solved or will the breaker of the PSU then blow if the PSU goes offline (power outage longer than battery)?

          "description": "Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.\n With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.\n What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).\n Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.\n Thanks All!\n    submitted by    /u/Lxr200  \n [link]   [comments]",

I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.\n My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.\n From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.\n I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:\n MikroTik\n QNAP\n I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).\n    submitted by    /u/giorivpad  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know there is plently of guys on here who are smarter than me when it comes these things and i would highly appricate a helping hand. Thinking about adding a Lsi Logic 9201-16i 16port 6gb/S too for more sata drives to be added and as well use the case Define R5 case as it seems perfect for a large NAS build.\n    submitted by    /u/Thomasthequestion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hello all,\n I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.\n Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.\n The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.\n Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).\n My question:\n  \nJust how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.\n \nAre there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)\n \nAny other potential issues?\n \n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/NateroniPizza  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.\n I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.\n I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?\n In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk). This makes backing up data easier to manage, also some disks/volumes/containers I want to encrypt.\n Can someone point me in the right direction?\n    submitted by    /u/wulf_rtpo6338  \n [link]   [comments]",

After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.\n I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?\n Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)\n    submitted by    /u/BigWillyHaverer  \n [link]   [comments]",

It doesn't have wireless and I don't see a reason to spend on the wireless components to put it somewhere around my house, so I figured maybe there would be a cool use case for it in my rack. So far, my homelab is pretty basic. Unraid server with the Arrs, plex, and supporting docker stuff for media. Cloudkey gen2 for my cams and access points. 24port ubiquiti poe switch. R210ii running pfsense and it's adguard. Pretty much sums it up.\n I'm wondering if there is some cool use case for this little guy short of selling it or making it a garage pc. Some sort of homelab use I'm overlooking despite not having a smart home for all that stuff.\n Thanks all, from a rookie.\n    submitted by    /u/Ride1226  \n [link]   [comments]",

I’ve gotten the okay to turn the downstairs closet into a server/electronics room. \n I plan on putting a rack in there, along with my TV tuner for the house, and whatever equipment our new ISP provides us with. \n The room is a pretty standard laundry closet - you could fit a stacked washer and dryer in there - has a 240V outlet and a 120V outlet. The water supply has been capped and cut off. And there is a vent that goes outside. \n Does anybody have any sort of guidance for this setup?

Mostly I want to do this based on some things I've seen at work going wrong and I was hoping to prototype or at least get an idea how much it would take to home grow a usable system without blowing our budget. \n I believe the access control system should be vlan-ed off from the regular network, but it would need to get updates from a domain controller when access is removed for an individual.\n The system needs to be independent of any cloud services and cannot rely on any internet based token generators due to the system needing to work in the event of communications failure.\n I'm thinking RFID or NFC based cards, because they are cheap to obtain and encode.\n Anyone have experience that can point me in a useful direction? \n I'd like to stick to open source if possible because this is a side project semi-related to work and I don't have a lot of disposable income to throw at it. I just want to build the system and see what kind of dependencies are required to get an idea how much smoke is being blown by security vendors.\n Thanks in advance for any recommendations.\n    submitted by    /u/N0Karma  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The UPS I have is the EP-400-8HTR-1000. It takes 4x7.2Ah 12V batteries. It worked normally providing power. However, the unit would power off after a few seconds on battery power. So, I thought to replace the batteries. \n When I pulled the old batteries out, they all tested ~13v. I put the new batteries in the same way the old ones were, all testing ~13v, and when fully wired shows 26v. \n I plugged the batteries back into the UPS and plugged the UPS into power. Won't turn on. If I disconnect the batteries, it will power on. Connecting the batteries immediately powers the device off. \n Looking for insight to if this is a possible fuse issue or something else?

In any scenario where there is a media server, the idea/goal is to get the content to direct play on the client side. Typically the client devices are an nvidia shield or an apple TV and 95% of the time I'd say those devices direct play (they are hard wired). They seem to only switch to transcoding when subtitles are involved or if the audio stream needs to be changed for some reason.\n I'm looking to see which NUC and/or if a mac mini would act as a good server if it ever had to transcode. The last thing I want to do is recommend a 1k server device and have it lock up while transcoding.\n Some additional information\n  \nno remote users, only local play (meaning, the library is not shared and won't have other family/friends streaming/transcoding/etc)\n very rare that more than one stream will be active at a time\n decent amount of UHD content, but being on the LAN (all devices are wired) as long as the client can direct play, I don't see 4k being an issue\n  \nI wasn't sure where else to post this because this is more of a hardware question vs a media server question. For transcoding purposes, am I looking for something with a built in video card or is the CPU more critical? Or both?\n Thanks.\n    submitted by    /u/tdhuck  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm looking for something to run a full fledged VM and/or Kubernetes cluster on.

I'm also not looking to build up a bunch of 3D printed or CNCd cases to put things that were never meant to be in a rack, well, into a rack. So here's some rough critera:\n  \n1U, 2U, or SFF formfactor (Think Project Tiny Mini Micro, small black boxes that can sit two side by side on a 1U rack shelf)\n 16 cores in a node, though preferably more like 32 threads (With or without Hyperthreading)\n Easily upgraded with DDR3 or DDR4 ECC RDIMMs off the shelf. I would like to be able to buy some DIMMs and upgrade the RAM in my existing nodes if I decide I want to expand the lab.\n 10GBE SFP+ built in OR multiple PCIE slots in the chassis to be able to add in my own PCIE cards\n Options to run multiple HDDs (preferably 2.5\" SSDs though even just a pair of m.2 slots would be good enough for a basic node\n Under $1000 for a node, though $200-400 would be even better as I want to buy many of them.\n  \nI'm sure I'm asking too much here, given the promised price, performance, and power consumption that comes with the ARM datacenter revolution, but it would be nice to start deploying ARM at home now that it's a few generations old.\n    submitted by    /u/AsYouAnswered  \n [link]   [comments]",

But if I got to customize one to a ridiculous extent then I'd be interested in a tower style mini rack, sorta like the Dell VRTX.

I could even look into cheap cases off aliexpress as I could probably wait (but shipping is crazy $$ to Australia)\n I thought about an old PC tower off marketplace, reuse the PSU, cooler and lie the case on it's side.

One of the best things I've done is setup our current asset management tool and patching solution in my home lab. I been able to test a lot of cases without affecting our production environment. \n    submitted by    /u/notta_3d  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've got almost 800 square feet of basement space, plenty of room to fit at least a half height server rack. But now that I have the space for a rack, I'm questioning if it's even the right choice? I figured I could get old rack mounted servers for cheap off ebay, but most of what I'm finding for cheap is almost 10 years old. Wondering if it would be better to just build a small desktop with a more modern CPU to handle the tasks I have in mind, which are:\n  \nVarious game servers: Minecraft, Terraria, Quake 3, etc.\n Video/Music storage (~20TB)\n Nextcloud\n Jellyfin\n Home security DVR\n Plus a handful of other smaller VMs/containers.\n  \nEnergy costs are pretty cheap where I am so I'm not super concerned about the power draw, and since this will be in my basement noise isn't a factor either.\n What are your thoughts, anybody go with rack mount and hate it?

What is reason for choosing your remote access setup and why is your way more secure than the next guys way.\n My remote access setup! I chose not to use a VPN, I created a domain name, used cloud flare for dns, setup a Ubuntu VM on my proxmox with cloudron image, and use Apache guacamole. Keep in mind I had to use my public IP for DNS, then I forward port 80,443 from my router to my Ubuntu VM.\n Problem, I don’t like the exposure and with cloudron they recommend not updating the image as they push their own security updates to the machine every night. Is this good or bad to rely on someone else to patch any new vulns or is it better that way since I’ll more than likely be late applying any patches.\n I really don’t like having any open ports on my ingress but seems like to remote access any network this needs to happen.\n Questions, comments, SECURITY CONCERNS?\n P.S. thanks in advance, looking forward to all the wisdom\n    submitted by    /u/According_Speed_2081  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is depending on what SSD's i can find and to what price.\n The SSDs need Power Loss Protection (else S2D complains and it's a bad time). Other than that, they need pretty high write endurance, especially if I'm using them as cache (at least 3 DWPD or 4 TBW per day according to Microsoft, though I doubt I'll actually manage to come close to this).\n If I can get the 8 bay version of the R620 them 2 bays will be for boot (raid 1). Then depending on the setup either for hybrid: 2 bays for SSD cache and 4 for HDD capacity, or for all flash: 4 for SSD capacity, 2 for scale-up. (This drivecount is the minimum required by Microsoft).\n I've been looking at intel Ark, and the p3700/p3600/p3500 series seem ok, but they are NVMe and I feel that is a waste. Considering the backplanes can have up to SAS 2 speeds (6 gb/s), thousands of mb/s is just unusable potential.\n I also don't have too much money, so those nvme drives are a good bit pricy.\n If anyone has any recs I'll gladly take them!\n    submitted by    /u/MrMrRubic  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm relatively new to IT as I started working helpdesk two years ago, so I'm fairly certain I don't have the know-how to build something entirely from scratch which leaves me feeling stuck and not knowing how to move forward. I've done my research and looked at tutorials and it all really goes over my head. As far as I can tell, there isn't any instant gratification type of solution where you can get a VM with AD and Exchange already built in ready for you to use. There's trial versions you can download, but they eventually expire and I'm not sure how affordable it is to keep paying for it once the trial runs out. For someone in my position, what are the things I should start learning so I can get to the point where I can eventually build a lab on my own, and be able to construct my own environment that mimics a production server?

I only have two problems and they are with his IPMI.\n  \nThe KVM is only with Java. Is there any update or something that can be done to add an HTML-based KVM to it? Because java doesn't work correctly, when I try to connect to it through the file it downloads to my Mac, it opens and then either crashes straight away or hangs and then crashes. And now I updated the java on my Mac and now it just gives me an error that it can't run this.\n The SSL there only supports TLS 1.0. Is it possible to update it to support at least TLS 1.2? It just seems that OpenSSL needs to be updated there, is there a way to do that?\n  \nThe IPMI version seems to be the most up-to-date - 03.19 \n And the BIOS version is - 3.3\n I would appreciate it if someone has a solution and can help me with this.\n    submitted by    /u/Itay1787  \n [link]   [comments]",

I read the Intel 11th gen doesn't have a good power consumption.\n 1st option:\n  \nCPU: keep the current Ryzen 3700x\n Motherboard: replace the Asus PRIME x470 PRO with the Asrock B550M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \n2st option:\n  \nCPU: Intel i5-12400F\n Motherboard: Asrock H610M-ITX\n Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202\n  \nOption 2 will cost me 200 euro more than option 1.\n I read the Intel 12th allows the IGPU passtrough, which might be interesting for plex/jellyfin.\n ​\n Questions:\n  \nDoes the mini-itx board consume less then mATX/ATX?\n Does the B550 chipset more efficent (less consumption) than x470? I read the x570 consumes 10-15w compared with B550, but I didn't find anyting related to x470 vs B550.\n Does it make sense go for option 2 (intel build) considering the difference price of 200 euro?\n  \nPower Supply\n Currently I have a Seasonic Focus GX650 (Gold); the node 202 requires to change the PSU with a SFX PSU. Which is best choice between 300W/450W/650W?

I surely want to run: vault warden, calibre web, pihole, filerun, jellyfin, syncthing (with a backup drive) and potentially many more services in docker containers. Besides that I was thinking about setting up proxmox to be able to experiment with different linux distros and setups.\n After watching most of the videos from ServeTheHome and doing a little research I found two models that are available from a trustworthy vendor:\n - Dell Optiplex 7060 Micro i7-8700T 6x2.4GHz 8GB\n - Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro i5-9500T 6x2.2GHz 16GB\n They both have the same price (500 in USD). I want to upgrade the RAM to 64gb anyway and get an NVMe SSD. Which one should I pick? I'm more convinced about the 7060 but I still want to hear an opinion of someone more experienced. Which processor will be better for virtualization with proxmox?\n I'm not completely decided on Optiplex either but it just seems like those machines are more solid and tested than lenovo or hp while being slightly cheaper - might be just my incorrect perception though.\n Any advice or comment is appreciated, I'm still learning how to homelab but it's so fun.

I've done most of the mainstream ones (Grafana, Plex (and the arr services), Wordpress, etc...) but I'm trying to find new ones to play with that I can actually have a use for. \n The first thing that came to mind when I thought about it was Home Assistant cause I haven't really done anything with that yet, but I don't exactly have any devices that would connect up to HA (or if I do, I don't really use them or don't know about them). \n Another thing I wanted to try doing was get a Grafana set up with Power Draw, but realized quick I would need special hardware that I don't really have the time nor money to get. \n Please help me get out of this rut if you have any ideas. \n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/TaloniumSW  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I've come to the realization that I have way too much stuff to keep track of in my head. I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.\n I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.\n If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:\n *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.\n I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.\n Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.\n    submitted by    /u/grumpy-systems  \n [link]   [comments]",

There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.\n I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. \n It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.\n Questions:\n  \nWhat are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?\n How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. \n Is there any fan out there that will not show the \"Fan Failed\" message in the console?

However, I can't really afford to do both of those, the computer I have priced out is around 2k and about 500-1k for the server. How possible would it be to combine the two and run a VM as my workstation? I plan to do a bit of gaming and remote work as a IT tech when I work from home. Gameplanning this, I want two GPU's one for passthrough for gaming and one for anything else I need on my server, like hardware decoding.

That's why I was start to testing all the \"not to do\" stuff. At home I've found an old Dell latitude laptop with i5 and 12 GB ram (extra I add an PWM fan with Ntc sensor for better cooling) , some caddy adapters and now I buy 2 powered USB hub. The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... \n Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. \n Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) \n Just home lab for fun\n    submitted by    /u/VictorSp1987  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The new solution.\n Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5\" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.\n So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.\n Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.\n Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.\n    submitted by    /u/knightcrusader  \n [link]   [comments]",

The case was delayed and I just wanted to use the PC, so I went without but now it seems way too cumbersome to strip the motherboard and install it in the case. But I feel that one day, I will sneeze or something and I'll break it. I currently turn it on by using a screwdriver to short the two prongs.\n Anyway, the way things work is that the PC runs a few data-heavy python scripts, then sends the data to another database which then is displayed on my site. \n I want to have the python code and the necessary files on a remote VM that is hosted by another company. I want to be able to access it from anywhere if I have to debug on-the-fly or if my PC eventually breaks. \n I would like to use a vmware horizon solution, but I've been navigating the site for over 30 mins now and can't just find a straight-up price / download. This effort to obscure the price makes me think that whatever the price is, it's too high. \n So, what is a low-cost and easy-to-setup windows VM that I can access remotely? It has to be hosted on a network that isn't my own.\n Thank you\n    submitted by    /u/Pale_Awareness_8633  \n [link]   [comments]",

It details all the headers on the motherboard thankfully and specifications. \n Box came with pfsense installed, 4gb ddr3 ram, i5 3.0ghz, and a 50gb ssd. Also has an expansion module with 4 additional NIC. Appears to be a pcie x8 interface so maybe in the future I can use a pcie riser and plop a fiber interface in the rear card slot if I ever want to upgrade. \n My plans are to use it for pfblockerng and openvpn for remote access. \n One fun thing I ran into is I want to pull the expansion module, no need for it drawing power, but then it changes the interface numbering (I think) so I can't access the LAN configuration screen of pfsense.

Before the upgrade I've been getting speeds very, very close to 10 Gb/s.\n NAS is Intel S5520HC (dual LGA1366 X5690) with 192 GB of RAM, and the card sits in PCIe 2.0 x8 slot. It's running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.\n PC is Z170/i7 desktop with 64 GB of RAM, with the card sitting in PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, and Win10 Pro 21H2. I have 25G DAC cable and both ethtool and Windows betwork panel pick up the connection as 25Gb/s. In both cases cards have sufficient airflow, in a form of a 140 mm 2000 rpm fan blowing over all PCIe devices.\n iperf3 -p 1 shows ~8.3 Gb/s, while -p 4, usually slightly lower, 7.9-8.1 Gb/s. File transfer peaks at ~700 MB/s to ramdisk over SMB and ~730 MB/s over NFS (that's from NVMe, of course).\n I don't see particularly high CPU usage on either side.\n I tried enabling RDMA, but it dropped speeds by around 1 Gb/s.\n I must admit this is not an upgrade I have expected. I do understand that my hardware is not exactly compatible (half PCIe connectivity on both platforms), but both 2.0 x8 and 3.0 x4 deliver around 4 GB/s bandwidth to each of the devices, and I do understand that Windows is not exactly the best system for high speed networks, but maybe there is something I can do in this situation that will help with transfer speed?\n    submitted by    /u/Trudar  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I picked up a Poweredge R620 and a pair of LSI cards from ebay to upgrade my linux NAS. The first card was running the full Dell RAID firmware so I pulled down the LSI 20.00.07 firmware, flashed it, and after rebooting it sees my individual drives as expected. This card is still dropping alerts on the console that one chip is at 51C and the other chip is at 59C.\n The second card was running LSI IT firmware v13, and even though it already saw my connected drives I flashed it with the same new firmware, rebooted, and confirmed all four chips between both boards are running the new firmware. Oddly, the second board is no longer reporting the temperature, and it was running at 50C/66C so it's definitely above the threshold that should be reported. This board is also in the slot against the side of the case and is surrounded by the framework so I expected it to be running hotter anyway.\n Now this second board was also running the oldest firmware, but considering its position I don't think a firmware change could really drop the temps down below what the first card (which is more in the open and getting better airflow) is reporting.\n So I'm stumped. All four chips were flashed from the same firmware file (I also flashed the onboard PERC H710 from the same file) so I don't understand why one board would stop reporting the high temps while the other board still shows them. The test drives I plug into each controller are detected and reading just fine so I know the hardware is all working. I haven't been able to find a CLI utility that will give me the temps directly from the cards but I feel like something may have gone wrong so I want to at least be able to confirm the readings.\n So does anyone have suggestions for why this card stopped reporting the temps, and/or a utility I can grab to verify the actual temps?

I am switching my Cisco SG300 with an ICX-6610 and want to have my trusted high-speed VLANs routed via L3 on the switch while keeping some on the firewall.\n DHCP/DNS is handled on Windows Server. I know I have to create router interfaces for my 4 trusted VLANs, change DHCP option 3 to the IP of that interface and then as it becomes the gateway for those devices, they will route on the switch. \n If I ping a device on VLAN 200-Storage from VLAN 20-Trusted, it would work. However, what happens when a device on VLAN 20 wants to ping a device on VLAN 30-IoT? The rules on the firewall allow that, but how do I ensure what is NOT going to my L3 VLANs get routed to pfSense? \n In other words, I want 4 of my VLANs to be L3 and everything else to be L2 with policy-based routing.

However, after looping my family into three applications I self-host, the complaints have stopped and I have achieved homelab immunity! Those are:\n  \nPlex. Shouldn't come as a surprise to most, but having an increased catalogue of content really spices up movie nights, and with tv shows for days there's less time to complain to me.\n Zoneminder. The ability to keep track of the house while away, practically unlimited recording, and no monthly fees with an Android app sold my averagely tech savvy parents. They feel peace of mind knowing that data is not going to the cloud and is controlled by another nefarious entity instead, me.\n Bitwarden. When I told my mom she didn't have to store her passwords in an excel sheet anymore I swear I saw a glimmer in her eyes. Not only that, but the ability to safely share passwords between family members while also keeping all data in house was great for my dad who routinely unplugs our google home minis so they don't \"spy on us\".\n  \nWhat self-hosted applications or homelab functionality has persuaded the commoner in your life that your homelab is worth it?\n    submitted by    /u/Theduke322  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Recently, I've been putting an older 2U server together for a friend as their first starter homelab. It's on the old side, based on a Supermicro X8DT3-F with the same SAS onboard and one PCI for the extra ports, based on LSI SAS1068E (pre-2008, 3gbps). \n I gave them 6 of the 10TB drives pulled from my own lab (upgraded from 10s to 14s on one of mine) 3 of which was an existing zfs raidz1, After booting up the system I found nothing wrong with importing the existing pool, until I went to add the 3 wiped disks to it. That was when I discovered the SAS controller had a 2.2TB limit to the drive size, even in IT mode. \n I thought to myself \"Self, you know ZFS does some fun stuff to make it function at a low level on the drives, which is why it won't work on a hardware RAID, maybe you shoud make those drives into a zpool and put them back in the system.\" So that is what I did, and to my surprise, the full 10TB was being addressed! I fully expected something to break fantastically when going over the 2.2TB point of any drives, so I loaded those bad boys up with as much random unedited video I could scrounge up, and filled all of them. Despite being rather slow, they survived a scrub and test play of several of the files.\n ​\n In the name of... Science (?) I figure anyone looking to get mega-old servers, or maybe those with some laying around, might find it interesting to turn practically useless hardware into backup servers of last resort, or like my friend, a somewhat slow starter lab. I would be especially interested to see if anyone successfully pulls this off to know I didn't somehow violate the laws of computing, common sense, and all that is holy.

Obvious solution is to use adapters, this brings me to my main question. My main question being:\n ​\n It doesn't seem that anyone sells just the little metal brackets that you screw the 2.5 inch drives into that you would then screw into a 3.5 inch drive bay without including the actual tray. If you've had to solve a similar issue, how did you solve it? Cheapest I've found the bays with brackets is at 8 dollars a piece\n ​\n It seems that the cheapest way of doing it is actually to buy a used drive tray's that come with the adapter bracket, this seems wasteful because I'll never use the drive bays since I already have some and it seems like it could be done cheaper since the bay itself is certainly the most expensive part of it. \n ​\n I found a couple of adequate STLs but I don't have a printer so I'm not sure whether I could actually get brackets for cheaper than the price of whole bays. \n ​\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/CombJelliesAreCool  \n [link]   [comments]",

I forget which one I actually chose... I think Nginx since they let me do wildcards and that way I'd only need the one certificate... But was that the best choice? \n Two related but other issues I'm having trouble with and would appreciate any advice on are:\n I know I have HSTS turned off on my Nextcloud/Nginx proxy manager but half the time when I connect via the fqdn from inside my LAN I'll get the HSTS error. A few minutes before or after and it'll seem to be working fine. If I connect from outside the LAN it's usually no issue.. \n When setting up the new nextcloud server, I made a test certificate.

I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.\n I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.\n What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.\n How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? \n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/firestorm_v1  \n [link]   [comments]",

My question mostly concerns the Mikrotik. Right now I have a home server that serves a samba share for a few kodi boxes, but it also is setup to do reverse proxy with subdomains so I can access my photoprism and jellyfin programs from the internet. Basically instead of typing <ipaddress>:<port> i can type <sitename>.duckdns.org/photoprism Is this something I can accomplish with a Mikrotik router? Or would a dedicated pfsense pc be better? The only reason I haven't decided to go pfsense is because I really don't want a second pc running all day. I guess I could build a new home server that supports virtualization and just run pfsense and my other network apps that way so it would only be one pc running, but I don't really know what kinda hardware I would need to accomplish all that.\n    submitted by    /u/JackBHandy  \n [link]   [comments]",

However I'm unable to configure it on Dell's site with 8 2.5in drive bays when using the Pentium CPU; it limits me to 4 3.5in bays.\n Does anyone know if I'm able to swap out the 3.5in bays for 2.5in bays? This is my first rackmount server, so I'm not sure if there's some chassis restriction that I'll run into when attempting to swap them.

          "description": "Hi Reddit,\n I have the following setup of servers: Dell PowerEdge R710 (six 3.5” bays)\n Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays) Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays)\n I have the following hard drives: 12x3TB 3.5” drives 8x300GB 2.5” drives 8x600GB 2.5” drives\n I have the 8x300gb in the R620 servers. Since there are six 3.5” bays in the R710, I can put six of the 3TB 3.5” drives there. One problem is that it has the PERC 6/I, which only supports up to 2TB. It also fails to start up at boot 90% of the time, so I want to replace it.\n That leaves me with 6x3TB and 8x600GB.\n I’ve spent some time on eBay, and I’ve found the following: 2xMX827 - This gives me 16 slots (8 per card) so I can have future expansion. These are 2.5” though, so I need another for the 3.5 drives.\n I also found 1xW814D, which is the same board I have in the R710 right now. I can buy another one and connect 6 more drives.\n That means that I will need more SAS controllers. I do not need RAID or whatever. I need to pass them through to Proxmox VE so I can do ZFS.\n The problem is that there is only one backplane power connector per server. My questions are the following:\n  \nHow would I connect more backplanes to power per server?\n \nWhat SAS controller can I use in PCIe that can handle these backplanes (preferably cheap, I’m a student)?\n \nWhat are the part numbers for the cables that I need to connect the backplane to the SAS controller?\n \n Any help is extremely appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/homelabthrowaway0121  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi folks,\n My WAF is at it's record lowes't right now, I've been working with a \"temporary\" setup for over 8 moths now just because i can't get myself to finish properly attaching my rack, and that is mostly because i made a mistake when choosing where to place my conduit; please bear in mind this is a cinder block location so any changes are very troublesome.\n A while ago we remodeled a small room in our home, which is kind of the man cave: it has a small shop and the \"internet\" side of my homelab; however, i decided it was a good idea to place a small rack the highest posible place, right above a sink, i tought \"i'll just set it up and wire it up neatly, put it there, set it and forget it\", however, It's been proven very difficult to finish this task (it's worth mentioning this is not my main homelab, this is just an omada setup, two ISP modems a UPS and some RPIs, so it's not something i'll be thinkering with a lot).\n The problem that i have is... it's very difficult to work or wire anything when the rack is hitting the ceiling, and on that setup i can only access the front and right side of the rack, so that is very hard.\n Can someone help me choose a better path forward? I'm thinking that i can either:\n - Overcomplicate this setup even more, putting the rack into an \"arm\" so I can lower the rack when i need to work on it\n - Change from a rack setup to a \"wall control\" (kind of like the one technotim has) on the same location\n I much rather not change the location of the setup, since I don't have much space and all of the connections are already in that spot.\n I hope that what i wrote made sense, thanks for letting me pick your brain\n    submitted by    /u/dermonty  \n [link]   [comments]",

I could pick up another card like a single slot; I have a RTX 1070 (as well as a RTX 1060) around somewhere that I'd be willing to dedicate to the Plex server.\n Please share your success (and failure!) stories so I can make an informed decision. Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/MickCollins  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I was poking around on Supermicro's website and was pretty surprised to learn they make switches. Specifically this one caught my eye: SSE-G3748-SONIC. It's marketed as an OOB Management Switch - i.e. the thing you plug all the BMCs in your rack into. It's a 48 port switch with 6x 25 gig capable SFP28/SFP+ ports. Obviously there are plenty of 48 port access switches out there with 2-4 SFP+, but I haven't seen many compatible with 25 gig SFP28 (and with 6 of them!) It's only 14\" deep and lists a max power draw of 150W with optics, so I assume it's probably not toooo ungodly hot and loud. And the support for the open source SONiC operating system is intriguing - that's a platform I have no experience with but tend to associate with serious wattage data center switches (strictly speaking I gu…",

And I also have a 70' ethernet run from the main house to a detached garage. The asus is old, I'm guessing it was purchased in 2015/2016. \n My wireless speeds are actually not bad. 30-60 on the 2.4ghz and 300+ on the 5ghz. The biggest problem is the detached garage, speeds out there are poor off of the netgear AP. \n I have a WAC104 Netgear AP in the detached building and I seem to have trouble with it. My detached garage is the most annoying problem. I have some smart devices out there and I want to be able to control them over LAN from inside the house. But when that AP acts up, they show offline. \n ​\n I'm debating if its worth the money to convert to an omada setup (Router, AP for detached garage, AP for house, and controller). Sounds like Omada would make managing the inside and outside AP's super simple. And if I ever wanted to add an outdoor AP (we may add a pool down the road) I could easily do so. \n ​\n All thoughts and suggestions are appreciated. ISP recently upgraded us from DSL to Fiber. So I went from 6/.5mbps to 500/500!\n    submitted by    /u/Secret-Midnight2313  \n [link]   [comments]",

I do not have Ethernet lines existent other than lines I choose to run within the apartment. Part of the environment Wi-Fi is WPA2-enterprise and I have absolutely no control whatsoever over the characteristics. I have a 31 dBm signal drop between the WAP and my back bedroom where my HomeLab resides. Currently, I connect to the WAP (wifi5, max 40MHz bandwidth channels) using a GL-iNet AX1800 FLINT (wifi6, configured as a repeater to Ethernet). I have two AV2000 PowerLine adapters which connect back to my HomeLab through the wiring in the apartment (this is a trunk line between two managed switches; the line is very noisy and I have experienced a max of 350Mbps (over a 7 foot distance); down from ~935Mbps using long Ethernet cables only - iperf, measured using two RPi 4Bs on either end). The current speed of this one line is 80Mbps down/64Mbps up. All other Ethernet cables in my HomeLab connected to active devices are at 1Gbps, except two RPi 2Bs which deliver 100Mbps. I mostly use my HomeLab for RPi experiments in conjunction with a VM/LXC Proxmox server.\n So just for grins and snickers, do you think a single line at 80Mbps/64Mbps is intolerable, or adequate? What do you consider a minimum speed for intra-HomeLab connections?\n    submitted by    /u/linuxweenie  \n [link]   [comments]",

This is where I put the mini-pc and want to put the nas. The problem is that my main pc is on the third floor.\n Back in the day when the house got built my dad only installed cat5(e?) utp that uses all 4 pairs (so he says and by my research this exists) to transmit 100Mbit down to the basement. While it works, I don't want to connect my nas to 100Mbit and would like to somehow get this to 1Gbit.\n The cables are built into the concrete and can't be removed and my dad doesn't want to spend any time/money on that because \"we only have 50mbit download, so 100mbit is good enough\".\n I know that there are RJ45 Y Splitter that use two 100Mbit 2pair cables to basically make 1Gbit. Is there any chance to make this work with 2 100Mbit 4 pair? I could probably use the Ethernet port in the room next to me, which would mean that the runs are probably not next to each other.\n Thanks for any help\n    submitted by    /u/Unknowniti  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have looked through many guides and they all seem to say similar things, but I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a concrete answer to if someone with experience can help with PXE.\n So with it being 4 nodes I don't want to use 4 different bays just to boot each of them up, I plan on using them for different use cases (a next cloud, and other hosted web-services) and my biggest question is if PXE is a suitable solution for this.\n It seems like PXE is really meant to only boot up installation media to install onto a local disk, so does that mean it isn't really for my use case, since I'm trying to avoid allocating 4 bays just for each node's boot drive. I have heard of iPXE which then uses ISCSI or NFS for persistant user data, which seems to be what I want, but I'm not looking for each node to boot the same files as they will have completely different use cases.\n Anyway, my main question is this, I want to be able to boot all 4 nodes up and each node just running like a standalone server that each has their own web-services to host, all while booting from a PXE server so that I don't have to have a local disk for each of the 4 nodes. I am not looking for someone to explain how to set it all up, I just want to know if PXE booting can do this for me or if I'm sort of barking up the wrong tree and should be looking at a different method entirely.\n    submitted by    /u/BootyMcJudy  \n [link]   [comments]",

I currently have 2 x R620s that I want to turn into a Proxmox Cluster. \n My current plan is to use the compute module on this to install something like TrueNAs, put a 10 gig NIC inside, and have it act as the shared storage for the proxmox HA cluster. Will this work? \n My second question is how best to set things up as it's another area I'm very noobish with. If I go with TrueNAS, I assume I can setup multiple disk pools/file systems? I've got two primary goals:\n  \nHigh speed disk storage for my VMs (only a dozen or so, but I'm impatient, so fast disk IO would be nice). I'd love to be able to clone an ubuntu template in a matter of minutes. \n Raw storage for my media library and other personal documents (with the appropriate backups in place). Current storage usage is around 18 TB on Unraid. \n  \nWith the above in mind, I was thinking about trying ZFS in a mirrored config (raid 10 equivalent) for the VM disk storage, and maybe another pool that is made up of raidz2 for the media? \n I could also try something like ceph or gluster with the 2 x R620s, and just put 6 x SAS drives in each one...that would eliminate the need for a high performance raid in the disk shelf. My goal is a redundant cluster as I want to start self hosting some important things and would prefer to avoid the risk of downtime etc. \n ​\n At this point I'd appreciate any general suggestions/advice. I'm not even sure if I can do what I'm thinking, and if I can do it, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. I did some reading up yesterday on trying to implement high IO ZFS for VM storage and it got over my head pretty quickly.\n    submitted by    /u/SigmaSixShooter  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hey /r/homelab\n My lab consists of a 1U server colocated in a local datacenter. It has a ton of CPU, RAM, and Storage for me and my friends to play around with. I've been running XCP-NG on it for years now. Looking to replace the server soon and may change hypervisors. I've run ESXi before but have not dived too deep into it. Does ESXi have these features or some equivalent?\n  \nCan vCenter manage the host behind a virtual network? Some background, the server only has 1 physical uplink that grabs my one IP. This IP goes straight into pfSense so the host itself has no physical network access. Because of this, I have to configure Xen Orchestra to manage the host via virtual adapters.\n Does vCenter offer \"resource groups\"? Xen Orchestra allows you to create Resource Sets. These are set limits on CPU/RAM/Storage that I can assign to a user or user group. This is great for allowing friends to play on my server without touching my stuff. I create a resource group, give them some resources, and they can then login into Xen Orchestra and create/modify/remove VMs at their will. They can't go over their resource limits, and they can't see or modify my VMs at all.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/LV_GC  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given the overwhelmingly positive response, especially to the results post, I decided to make this a yearly thing. This year I have no academic purpose anymore, I'm just doing it to satisfy my own, and hopefully your curiosity.\n The survey can be found here. I have updated the survey a bit compared to last years; I have accounted better for the possibility of virtualisation and asked more detailed hardware questions. The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.\n Of course, results will be posted back to this subreddit. Given that I no longer have any academic constraints, I should be able to post more detailed results than last year, and hopefully somewhat faster ;)\n I have already communicated with the moderators and gotten permission for this post.\n    submitted by    /u/SelfHostingAutomated  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "A few years ago I bought a bunch of old used parts on eBay and build a modest server. It's a 4c/8T Xeon, m-ITX SuperMicro board, in a Node 804 case. I currently have 2x SSD cache and 5x HDD. I learned a lot but I've outgrown it and really want an upgrade. A few things I learned:\n  \nRegret the Node 804 case. Was a pain to build in. I wish I went full size ATX with a vertical stack of 8 drive bays. Eyeing the Fractal Design Define 7.\n Liked the piece of mind of ECC RAM and dual Ethernet\n IPMI came in clutch a few times\n I don't have enough cores/threads, I'd want at least 8c/16T next time\n I don't have enough PCI slots, only had enough room for one transcode GPU for Plex and one SAS card to expand the 6 SATA ports\n I wish I got a CPU with Intel QuickSync to use for Plex\n  \nSo to address the PCI issue, I figured a board with 10 SATA slots (2x SSD cache, inevitable 8x HDD) would clear that up, be better for cable management, and be one less point of failure vs my SAS card. Plus if I could find a CPU with ECC and QuickSync I'd save a PCI slot. Now I'd have enough room for 1-2 GPUs to finally have better VM performance. I'd want 1 light gaming VM and 1 productivity/streaming VM which could benefit from a basic GPU. If I ever needed more drives I still have my SAS card. So 3 PCI total.\n Another thought, is 10gbe worth it? None of my devices are ready for it, but how nice is it for future proofing? My main computer is an M1 MacBook Pro so I at least have Thunderbolt 4.\n Lastly, I can see a benefit in having a second cache pool for VMs. Probably just a single M.2 drive for VMs.\n The issue with all of the above, is it seems a board that supports: ECC, IMPI, M.2, 10x SATA 6gb/s, Dual 10gbps Ethernet, is $570 which is a lot to go for. It seems only the SuperMicro X11SPI-TF checks all those boxes. Is it worth it in the long run? Or what compromises should I have?

I've gone the route of VMWare / KWM / virtualization solution but the performance is poor and honestly just not worth the headache to hackintosh it from Apple.\n I've been looking at something like a 2019 / 2020 Mac Mini because the RAM modules should still be upgradeable. Are there any recommendations for specific Apple hardware that has a few years of OSX support still remaining? I've thought about doing a Macbook as well, but I plan to run it mostly headless, so the extra size is not something I'm eager to waste space on.\n    submitted by    /u/Aprelius  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the main problem is that VPN server IP is easily recognized as IP that belongs to hosting provider. So what I decided to do is to put Raspberry Pi at my home and set up WireGuard on it. \n But I run into a problem. I need to be able to connect to WireGuard server (peer) from outside. And my internet provider doesn't provide me with a public IP to my router, rather than router is behind internet provider NAT which I can't control.\n There is an option to opt into static IP. But they might have a separate pool of static IP, which may raise some red flags that I might be using a VPN. Also, preferably, I wanted to have different incoming and outgoing IPs of my VPN.\n One of the possible ways is reverse tunnels to Raspberry Pi. But since ping is also an issue, I either have to have a server in the same city or use a direct connection.\n What are my best options? My main priorities are to keep my VPN IP less suspicious and keep ping as low as possible (but the distance between server and client is 7000km+, so extra 10-20 ms won't matter).\n If reverse tunnel to can I do it all purely on WireGuard. Let's say I have peer with public IP to which both VPN server and client are connected, and use VPN server as gateway on my client?\n And are there any options to connect directly?

I've tried advising him so far from an IT Professional standpoint but he's still playing the \"I know better\" card with his Mom and Nan so they want a solution from me to stop him doing those things on their networks as they don't trust him to listen to what I've told him (and I'll be doing it on mine but I already have better routers)\n Naturally because he's 18 so software on his laptop isn't an option so content filtering at a network level feels the best way to go.\n tl:dr - I need a method to block certain content for a certain device (or devices) at a network level as a software block can't be installed on the devices\n    submitted by    /u/OhmegaWolf  \n [link]   [comments]",

I did some searching about power on this forum and found a lot of guys quoting large numbers but the info on the setup was lacking.\n I am currently looking at acquiring a HP Proliant DL580 G8 4x Xeon E7-4890 4x 1200w and running a project that hopefully will eventually end up with it being maxed out (Lots of virtual machines).\n Now maybe I'm reading this wrong but according to the specs it says that each processor can pull 1200 watts max? Which checks out with the unit having four power supplies?\n My doubt is that since this is a home setup your average room's plug/circuit maxes out at a 1500w pull. Which means if each processor goes above 25% usage then it will blow the circuit. \n Does this mean that people who run these out of their homes have massively beefed up their office/lab wiring to deliver all that power, or does the server just not actually pull that much at normal/low operation? \n I'm happy to start off slow and just run one VM or two on the server while I figure out the power issue, but I'm trying to get an idea from you guys if I need to upgrade my houses wiring (since I do plan on maxing it out eventually), and if I do need to upgrade the home then how much do I realistically expect to draw with it running at low utilization at the beginning when I am learning?

Basically anytime someone types in \"service.mydomian.com\" the connection will initially be blocked. I would then recieve a notification on my phone or an email saying something to the effect of \"111.111.111.111 is trying to connect to service.mydomain.com\" and then provide the options of \"Trust, Allow, Deny\". \n ​\n I like the idea of having yet another layer of security on my internet facing services. However from what I can tell things like Authellia would work just fine for loggining in from a webbrowser, but most of the things I have hosted are used through a companion mobile app and from what I can tell Authellia or others wouldnt work in that scenerio. \n However if the Authentication was done on a secondary device and was completely invisible to the mobile app then I imagine it would work. Such as if I had a friend that I wanted to let use my server, they would download the app and try to login. On the first attempt they will just get an error that says they cant connect. But then I would get notified of the attempted connection where I can choose to permanently trust their IP, Allow it once, or Deny it. Then they try to login again and are able to connect. \n ​\n Does something like this exist?

          "description": "Let me preface this by saying this is my fault for not reading the fine print, not the ebay seller's.\n I bought a set of four 600GB Toshiba AL13SEB600 sas drives to use in an HPE Proliant DL360 G6 server. I didn't read the part of the description that says \"these drives are for NetApp Servers\", figuring any old 2.5 sas drive would work. Unfortunately all four drives give me the orange 'drive failed' light and don't show up at all in the P410i raid card config menu. I know the slots and raid card are good, since the original 72GB drives still work fine. So it seems that the seller was right that they can only be used in a NetApp server (or they're broken, which I have no way of knowing). The thing is, I'm pretty sure from the datasheet that these are not special drives or anything, they should be regular old sas drives.\n Edit: I forgot to mention, the DL360 G6 datasheet does say that the server can handle a maximum of 4TB (8x500GB) storage, but I don't think that's the problem, since I've connected over 5TB of mixed drives, including one 3TB drive, and it's functioned without issue.\n Which leads me to my question. How could drives be configured in such a way that they work on one system (netapp), but completely fail at the hardware level in another (HP)? Beyond that, how can I reformat them to work in my HP server (assuming they're actually functional)?\n Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm very new to enterprise type stuff and I didn't see anything helpful in my quick googling.\n    submitted by    /u/Darkextratoasty  \n [link]   [comments]",

My first thought was my crawl space, but there are a few problems which need to be overcome to pull this off like temperature and humidity control, access restrictions and cabeling.\n Cabeling for me is easy since the breaker panel and switching is right above it and just need new cables.\n The crawl space is hard to access but having some redundancy in disks and IPMI control on my servers will help out a lot since I don't need to access it daily anyway.\n But the last big problem is temperature and humidity control. I placed a sensor which measures that and logged it for 5 months. In peak summer it never went above 24 degrees and now in autumn it did not went below 18. This is good since it is never too hot and hopefully not too cold even in freezing weather. There are also ventilation holes in case the lab produces too much heat.\n But the humidity! It never went below 95% relative humidity in the summer and in the last month 100%. I read trough the manuals of the hardware I have and it is all rated for below 90%. Hard drives won't be a problem since they are helium sealed. \n So I think this won't be such a problem because humidity only condenses on cold surfaces and servers inherently get warm. Along with the heat it all produces it might push the relative humidity down and not be such a problem.\n I might also put a fan against the exhaust vents in case it gets really bad but I'd rather not because that will definitely screw with the house's isolation since crawl spaces are for isolation of the house.\n Has anyone experience with a setup like this?\n location is the Netherlands btw. house is below water level but water never occurs in the space, it is just really humid\n    submitted by    /u/Wide_Perception_4983  \n [link]   [comments]",

But asking around, experienced friends mentioned two things, 1) LSI card IT mode is a thing, therefore SATA port count does not matter too much, 2) apparently supermicro and decommissioned server boards exist (average pulled-not-refurbed offerings were on the higher end of my budget; not going to get any of the beefy ones).\n I start to hesitate whether to get an average desktop board and grab a LSI, or find a previously owned sm board. Searching in the subreddit, it seems both have been done, but I didn't see opinions of choosing between the two, although points have been made about whether it's good to get second hand motherboards. \n I am comfortable with using HPC servers and have done some VPS self hosting for fun, but this is my first time to build and maintain a physical server. I have had no experience of using LSI.\n Is there any pitfalls to turn me away from either options? Any thoughts are appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/eaxfxae  \n [link]   [comments]",

My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. \n As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini. I know that mac has limited ext4 support, but I'd prefer to run the drives in a mac-native (still cross-platform) file system. \n So my questions are:\n  \nWhat filesystem would work best in this case? I have heard good things about exfat, and it seems like a good cross-platform option. I am also open to APFS.\n How best can I go about migrating my data onto the new filesystem? Is there a tool that can do this?\n As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.\n  \nThanks!\n    submitted by    /u/_CINN4M0N_  \n [link]   [comments]",

Should I buy one of these, gut it and modify it to install a motherboard? Go with a tower and mount them? Or do I pick up a small used pc (m70 etc) and use these? So many difficult decisions...\n How much raw power do you think I will need? I am not worried about how long things take since it will sit somewhere out of the way and do its thing (probably headless).\n Thank you in advance\n    submitted by    /u/Plainzwalker  \n [link]   [comments]",

Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.\n Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures? Can anyone recommend a good model with both enough power and never sleeps the drive?\n    submitted by    /u/AgreeableLandscape3  \n [link]   [comments]",

Or am I doomed to download all the images I need one by one, manually?\n Thank you for your help!\n    submitted by    /u/Franz91  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. \n Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).\n So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?\n    submitted by    /u/TheBirdOfFire  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.\n    submitted by    /u/SkyLegend1337  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).\n Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.\n Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5\" bays and is less than 19\" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.\n ​\n Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?\n This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082\n This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/\n This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179\n    submitted by    /u/icelandismine  \n [link]   [comments]",

Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.\n This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once).

Thinking it'll just be a place to stick important files without too much trouble. Here is what I would like to be able to do:\n ​\n  \nStick family photos and videos on, from any source (Windows, macOS, iOS)\n Stick important docs on (old tax turbo tax PDFs, etc)\n Maybe stick some music files on\n  \nImportantly, be able to VIEW and edit the files if needed. Specifically I am thinking about our pics, which are incredibly disorganized, duplicated, etc. Would like to be able to open up the iPad and go through the NAS and be like \"that one sucks, DELETE... that one is upside down, FIX.... Create a \"wedding pictures\" folder and move all these pics over there.... etc*\"\n Is all that possible?\n \\One thing that I am not clear on... let's say I go to a folder full of pics on the NAS and start editing them on an iPAD (or whatever device, PC, MAC, etc). Am I using whatever photo viewing / editing SW to view and edit the file residing on the NAS (i.e. the SW is acting like a \"window\" to look at the file still residing on another computer).... or am I pulling the file ONTO the device, making changes, and then when I hit \"save\" it overwrites (uploads) the new file to the NAS?*\n I am not sure there is a fundamental difference in outcome but just wondering.\n    submitted by    /u/_How_Can_She_Slap_  \n [link]   [comments]",

I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.\n The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.\n TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.\n Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...\n    submitted by    /u/KRS_88  \n [link]   [comments]",

I want to be able to plug in a drive, search around for what it contains out of the larger drive, and copy individual files back without doing a full restore. Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. \n Is there a solution that can do all this?

          "description": "This is a \"problem\" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.\n The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.\n One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on \"disk1\" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.\n To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.\n Some info about my system:\n  \nOS: Arch Linux\n Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1\n Asus Prime H510M-K\n Intel i3-10100\n 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)\n Disks directly connected to the motherboard\n  \nI experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.\n I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.\n I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.\n    submitted by    /u/bepsifif  \n [link]   [comments]",

By HBA, mean SAS HBA devices.\n My question would be - Why such devices are preferred in comparison to plugging many HDDs to SATA ports? \n At the moment I have 6 drives connected, these already populate entire motherboard's available SATA ports. Also have an PCI Express SATA Controller Expansion Card (1 x PCIe X1 to 4 SATA), but currently there is no need in more slots. While on other hand probably I would like to expand drive pool later. Heard such cards are not recommended, because often cheaply built and can affect speeds as all drives will share single interface.\n    submitted by    /u/q1525882  \n [link]   [comments]",

I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.\n The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...\n Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression? Seems pretty ridiculous, but I'm kind of curious about it.\n Clearly thought, an image cannot just stay inside an MKV container, it's too much of a pain.\n Sorry for the weird question and thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/LynxesExe  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Just showing off but I thought this might be useful to people who own several hundred GB of comics. I use it to repack high quality manga on my Kobo, it more than doubled the amount I can store at once.\n I know such repacking software already exists because people post on manga sites all the time, but I couldn't find any scripts online, much less ones that were easy to use. This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.\n Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.\n The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.\n This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.\n https://github.com/avalonv/reCBZ\n    submitted by    /u/reallyfuckingay  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. \n I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault\n It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.\n So my best thought is that ideally \"everyone\" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.\n Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the \"library of alexandria\" idea.\n Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.\n Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group!

I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. \n I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. \n I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB.

Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.\n  \nBut what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?\n From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? \n If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? \n And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk? (and prevent bitrot)\n Also, how frequently should we be doing this? ..every 3 months? ..every 6 months? ..every year? \n How many of you guys are storing drives offline like this?

The rest is either only on A or on B.\n ​\n Both A and B have new added and removed data.\n I want to merge them to keep only one going forward.\n ​\n I tried to resolve the issue manually and with the help of https://freefilesync.org/\n but i get more mess than before\n ​\n i thought about my issue and think i could tackle it in a two step way:\n ​\n  \n​\n  \nfirst remove on Drive B every file that exists on Drive A at the same location and is identical\n wich leaves me with a delta of only Files Existing on Drive B that are either changed, added or removed from Drive A\n ​\n 2)\n the second step would be to check which files that are left on Drive B do already exists on Drive A in any location and are identical (so i can catch files that were moved on Drive A to a new location) and delete them from Drive B\n Result:\n Which would leave me with just new and unique files on Drive B with a much smaller subset wich i could tackle manually and sort where need be\n ​\n does any of you have any Input or faced a similar problem? do you know of any tools that can do either step one or two. Much appreciated \n I visualized what I want to achieve in this image:\n https://preview.redd.it/ymvud7nk35y91.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=03be52ba964b256795ee5adde51da45aeef0f122\n    submitted by    /u/altsphaantm  \n [link]   [comments]",

We just want more comprehensive updates on product inventory at places like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, GameStop, etc. to tweet and write articles about them for everyday consumers as an extension of our product reviews arm.

(I think this is the most likely scenario to happen, but you guys can maybe think of more) \n What am I to do, to prevent malicious use and what am I responsible for? What kind of legal charges could be made against me if a user uses my service like this.\n I own a registered business and would make individual contracts with each user including sending out invoices etc. So I know every user by name, adress and bank details at least.

Am I worrying over nothing?\n  \nI already have two fans blowing over these hard drives, is there anything else I can do to keep the temperatures down (preferably not liquid cooling)\n \nThis temp spike seems totally unrelated to system activity. No spikes reads/writes, network calls, spikes in number of processes or cpu. I can't think of any other signals of \"this server is working hard\". I'm usually asleep when this happens, I'm totally baffled why this temp spike is happening. Can anyone think of any other reason the HDD temp would spike?\n \n Thank you for the help friends\n    submitted by    /u/kaivaii  \n [link]   [comments]",

A friend of mine is really commited using DVDFab. This brings me to my first question:\n Do both create a lossless backup of the Blu Ray or does one create a better output (wheter it being the folder structure or a packed iso)?\n Also, while I constantly check the revision history of MakeMKV, is it possible that future updates create better outputs or are the current ones already completely lossless? And if so, is there a way to compare the disk with the created backup to check if there has been an bugs which created a quality loss (for example by not copying some files)\n A little exkurs - do DVDFab, AnyDVD and MakeMKV differ in the creation of the output (video files like mkv) talking about quality or are they same?\n    submitted by    /u/d3crypti0n  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a few directories that I need to keep data synced to share amongst a few windows machines. Drive did this pretty well. \n I’ve looked around a bit, and the options seem slim in comparison to the same experience I had with drive. Here’s some of the things I’ve considered:\n  \n rclone, currently top of the list. Doesn’t quite capture my requirements, but could mash something up scheduler to sync a few times a day or something \n  Freefilesync, bravo for open source but looks clunky\n  Syncthing, love the concept, but hate the idea of having to run a client on the NAS. I also don’t need the data encrypted in transit\n  Bypass all this nonsense and just store my data directly on the share. The only problem with this approach is there are times when I am mobile with no connectivity and still need a locally cached copy to work from to sync back later. \n  \nI’ve seen a few paid for options as well which I am not opposed to, but wanted to get an idea from folks that may have followed a similar path as myself.\n    submitted by    /u/digilink  \n [link]   [comments]",

Instead of purchasing (for example) a Synology NAS and then installing drives. Would you consider purchasing a custom solution at a cheaper price (for comparable specs) or more/better specs for the same price?\n An initial build plan comes to around £600 but provides 4 x 4TB ironwolf drives in Raid 5 for a total storage capacity of about 12TB. Plus the ability to run additional ‘modules’ on the server to allow for more than just NAS functionality.\n Any suggestions/feedback or ideas are welcome.

          "description": "Hi guys, seeking advice. \n My NAS has two 4TB drives which are full. I am using them for back up of my personal/family photos and videos. Occasionally I use the NAS to stream some videos to my TV. I don’t use the NAS for anything other than that. Since buying a new camera, my storage capacity is filling up very quickly. \n It’s very important to me that I don’t lose these files so I have the drives set in RAID1. (I’ve been reading up on this subreddit and I am also going to make an extra copy on an external hard drive to store at another location.)\n Using a NAS for this has really been working great for me since I don’t need to worry about backing up or anything, I am always sure that my files are stored on 2 drives. \n What should I do? These are the options as I see them:\n Option 1 is to buy new drives with bigger capacity and use these to replace the drives I already have. \n Option 2 is to buy a NAS with 4 bays. Keep my 2 existing drives and buy 2 new drives to expand the volume. \n Are these options any good? Maybe you guys have different suggestions?

          "description": "Hi all,\n I normally buy Seagate hard drives and have had good experience with their RMAs, especially since they still include return shipping as part of their Advanced RMA program (at least they did last year) and their staff is on-shore in North America.\n One of myWD Red 10TB died over the weekend in my unRAID setup after <2 years of service so I setup an Advanced RMA for $25 USD, so far so good, but the drive that they sent me was DOA, it won't even boot - can't be recognized in my USB dock nor in my server's SATA slots. So much for being \"certified\".\n DOA should not be a problem right?\n Most companies will take care of customers when it's their issue, so I call up WD, and they say:\n  \nThere can only be one Advanced RMA outstanding\n They will setup a standard RMA for the DOA replacement\n They want me to ship the DOA replacement and then WD will send the replacement - so much for \"Advanced RMA\".\n  \nI paid $25 for Advanced RMA, and I got nothing out of it except a DOA drive - now I have to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement drive. Amazing they're so inflexible with their RMA system, I guess that's what happens when all the staff is outsourced overases.\n I'm surprised at the bias towards WD, especially with how poor their RMA process is. This alone is going to put me off buying WD drives for my NAS even if Seagate supposedly has a higher failure rate (which they may, but replacements are easy to come by!).\n Anyone else facing troubles with WD RMAs?\n I have about 50 - 60 drives in my various NAS devices, and this is the second time in a row that I've had issues with WD RMAs, during 2020, it took several months to get my RMA back, and the lack of communication and inflexiblity of their RMA department doesn't seem to be addressed.\n    submitted by    /u/Neat_Onion  \n [link]   [comments]",

I see a lot of talk about using sata power splitters, but couldn’t I just buy a couple extra Sata power cables from Corsair? \n Is there anything I’m missing here? How many drives can I power on the HX850? 5v @ 25amp on this psu.\n I’m probably gonna have this PSU powering only Sata drives in a DAS box. Might have to save a sata/peripheral port for the HBA expander. Is that gonna be a problem electric wise since I’m not powering any 12v components? And how does the switch for single or multiple 12v rails work for my use case? \n Any tips would be appreciated thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/No_Sale7548  \n [link]   [comments]",

Veracrypt, Boxcrypt solves this problem by adopting a volume based approach but it's not suitable for cloud storage.\n Some tools I've used:\n  \nRclone - By far the most stable but sadly it neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening. By using the crypt remote, the files sizes do change, but it's a static transformer which can be easily deciphered to get plaintext size. By using chunker along with crypt, file sizes could be hidden to some extent, but not completely.\n Cryptomator - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Securefs - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.\n Gocryptfs - Neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening.\n CryFS - Supports both file size obfuscation and directory flattening !! In theory this should be a good fit, but sadly it suffers from terrible performance issues due to the fact that it chunks files into fixed size small blocks (4kb - 32kb). The block size can be configured but it poses some other issues.\n  \nI've tried all sorts of combinations but it's either unstable or hacky. Looking for any leads here.

I myself have 110GB worth of pictures. My family members to have more. It's likely to be a home server? I am not sure. \n I wondered if I could give each family member 1TB of space.

That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.\n The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now.

I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.\n Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.\n Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).\n Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.\n I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.\n Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?\n    submitted by    /u/GuruDev1000  \n [link]   [comments]",

The max amount i found where some lsi cards with 24 ports and they where quite expensive.\n I also read about expanders but how negative is the effect on the performance?\n From what i understand you could for example split a single 6g connection to two 3g ones, which should still be fine for hdds, right?\n Would it work to get one of the 24 ports with an expander and then use (theoretically) 48 disks at 3g each, without a performance hit when all disks are written to at the same time?\n Thx :)\n    submitted by    /u/Pommes254  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've noticed though that archive.org seems to be having trouble keeping IPA files available for download, or at least I assume so.\n For example, one of my favorite iOS games, Gesundheit! by Matt Hammill, has been delisted for a few years now. I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).\n Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.\n    submitted by    /u/J0mSp00ns  \n [link]   [comments]",

I figured if there was anywhere that could help me with large storage servers, it'd be r/datahoarders\n I recently had a bad electrical experience which knocked out my storage server. ( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. \n My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array. (none of the drives in question were from the original failure) I am at a complete loss at what kind of formatting and partitioning these drives were set up with. The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.\n First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.\n  \nMacroit says they're each just one large logical partition\n AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions\n Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.\n  \nWhen I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.\n I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.\n I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.\n    submitted by    /u/ArcTechNerd  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have a pretty large physical movie collection (mixture of blu-rays and 4k UHD blu-rays). 99% of the time I'm watching these movies at my PC on my 21:9 ultrawide monitor, so I started ripping the files off the disk and put them on an external drive.\n The problem is I have a mini-ITX PC that is already packed to the brim and can't fit any extra drives beyond the couple m.2 slots on the motherboard. I also don't have a lot of desk space to store a large desktop HDD, NAS, etc., etc. I decided on a 5TB portable USB-powered external, because at least at the time (and I think still now) that was the largest size I could get in that form factor). \n When 4k blu-ray files are upwards of 60gb and regular blu's are like 30gb, a 5TB would fill up relatively quickly. So I started encoding the files using handbrake (for a number of reasons, but one being I could knock those file sizes down by at least half, if not more). \n I'm using Nvidia NVenc to encode my files because it's a lot faster using the GPU vs CPU, but I've only just recently realized that the quality suffers. Tbh, it's not the worst thing in the world I've ever seen, but when I compare it to the original ripped movie file I can see the difference and now I can't live with it. \n So, now I'm thinking I'm not going to encode at all and just gonna store the original movie files as is. I guess this means I'm gonna need a lot more than 5TB, though, but my problem still stands that I just don't have a lot of desk space for larger external drives. \n The other issue is that anything more than those 2.5\" portable drives usually require their own power brick and it will be nearly impossible for me to access an outlet at this point around my desk. \n Do I have any options? Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions based on my restrictions?\n    submitted by    /u/clothing_throwaway  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Backstory\n I live in Europe and back in 2018 a friend of mine was in the US and picked up a few Easystore 8TBs for me. I shucked them all and put them in my Synology NAS. All worked bar one which could not be detected. I connected it back to my PC first using a WD Elements adapter/case (the Euro version of the Easystore) and the drive was not even detected. Then I used the Easystore \"adapter\" and it powered up but it was detected as a 2TB drive and I could do nothing with it. Windows Disk Manager said it needed to be initialized but threw an error when I tried. WD Utilities said the SMART test failed and that I had apparently entered a password wrong 5 times. The only option was to Erase but then it threw an exception with no details when I tried that. It was a legit disk too, not one that someone had swaped out and sent back to the store. Since I was not in the US and I had shucked it I assumed I would get no help from WD and put it in a box and forgot about it.\n So now in 2022 its out of warranty and I am curious if there is anything I can do to revive it? Amazingly I still had the adapter from the Easystore case attached to it. I plugged it in again today and it was the same as before. I dont hear any funny sounds either. It spins up when I connect it to the computer, shows up in Disk Manager, still as 2TB but I still cant do anything with it.\n One thing I am not sure about is whether the Easystore adapter I am using is the one that came with the 8TB drive. I had a batch of Easystore 3TB drives previously and it may be from those so maybe that is having trouble with the 8TB drive.

Any real reason to go 5950x over the thread ripper? Power consumption isn't really an issue. \n I've got a bunch of systems in play already here (with about 1/4 of 2pb used across a few Supermicro builds / jbods) that i'm going to consolidate here. I'm thinking once I get the data over (I have serious data backed up in two off site locations) i'm going to rebuild the other systems into a ceph cluster. For now, i'm debating truenas or proxmox with zfs pools. I'm thinking 10 of 9 drives with one hotspare per, but i'm open to other suggestions. \n Feel free to tell me where I'm probably making the wrong decisions.\n    submitted by    /u/SwallowedBuckyBalls  \n [link]   [comments]",

But the new drives, for lack of any motivation one way or another, I’ve setup as RAID0. My motherboard handles the RAID and so now I’ve got a single 24TB volume in Windows. I’m using Win7 Pro still but that’s fine.

After all, the breakout cables are using RCA connectors, which S-Video was deliberately designed to circumvent. I'm just a bit skeptical and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether or not that would be an issue, and of course I am also open to other capture card recommendations! \n Thanks!

I use it purely to back up unimportant data since it could die any moment now.\n I'm transferring files from it onto a new drive after the previous one had to be RMA'd and I noticed something strange. When transferring one particular file, the transfer froze and so did crystaldiskinfo which I was using to monitor the new drive under load. The \"read error rate\" value kept decreasing (meaning the errors were going up). I figured the drive was finally dead or it was an issue with the specific sectors holding that file. Killed the transfer, started it again excluding that file. Everything started moving smoothly again. \n However, what struck me as odd was that once I did that, the \"read error rate\" value reset to the default value of 100, as did the \"worst\" value. As if nothing had happened at all. I just checked it again and the transfer is still going, but the \"read error rate\" value was back down to 98, then reset itself when I refreshed crystaldiskinfo. No other utility shows an issue either. I know the drive's probably dead. but anyone have any clue why the value keeps resetting?\n    submitted by    /u/Hargan1  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'd be streaming mostly to my laptop, but also to smartphones and TVs from time to time, so it would be nice if it had transcoding capabilities.\n I tried reading through the wiki, but I simply felt overwhelmed by the information and decided I'd rather ask for an informed opinion, so any advice is very much appreciated!\n    submitted by    /u/fabiorzfreitas  \n [link]   [comments]",

When compared with diy and you look at the hardware costs (cpu, ram, hba, psu etc) i ended up with like 8000€ just for the case on a 10000€ server\n  \nAm i asking for to much?\n What are your setups, ideas, tips.\n Would be really thankful for any help.\n    submitted by    /u/Pommes254  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have several files that aren't needed in a daily basis (or even a yearly basis), and it seems a waste to not burn them into optical disks (even multiple times) or even external USB disks (HDDs or SSDs). I don't want to lose what I have stored in the extenrnal disks though, because I may end up re-downloading it. Additionally, I seem to have some files in multiple disks (for reasons), or similar files that I want to reorganize. It seems I have multiple VHDs taken from various systems, for example, all strewn in multiple external USB HDDs.\n In my ideal world, somebody will have made a special file system that would keep the list of the files (maybe with some minimal extra metadata, such as checksums, thumbnails, duration etc) offline, and when you do a modifying file operation (such as moving a file from one folder to the next), the UI for the file system would ask you to insert disk A to do the writes (or maybe insert disk A and disk B so that it can move the files from one disk to the next, or insert CD A to copy the files from it and mark them as deleted, etc.). Does such a program exist? Has anyone used anything like it.\n As a second best solution, I'd like something that you just register a disk (optical or HDD/SSD) and it records what it has on it and displays within its own UI (so no actual file system). I'm pretty sure something like that exists, but my searches have been fruitless - maybe I'm not describing this correctly.\n I figured if something like this exists, this subreddit is probably the best place to ask.\n    submitted by    /u/gschizas  \n [link]   [comments]",

Make screenshots from shop, take photos of package, take photos of device insides (preferrably good quality), write down chip names, do a eletronic analysis if you can, do a firmware dump if you can (with UART tool ,not necessary), post it to our Elektroda forum (our reliable hosting, this forum has about 20 years history) and I will add your work to the list.

It's 90% static files, and those that do change, I'm not concerned with snapshots too much\n However, for backing up, I've previously just rsynced to a bunch of USB drives, which is not practical, so I'm setting up a new solution. At the moment, I have still got USB drives, grouped into one big LVM, on a VM server, with a 20TB LVM-thin drive pointed at a backups VM. Little complicated, but will be very easy to expand (though I am fully aware that one dead drive will kill the backup and I will need to start again - I'll have a 3-2-1 in place soon too though)\n Anyway, looking at the backup solutions on here, there's loads of options, such as Borg and rdiff, as well as simply rsync, but I am aware that ZFS has two very useful features (I'm not well versed in ZFS though sadly!):\n  \nSnapshots, in case I completely bork something and don't notice until 3 backups later\n \nDeduplication. I have a \"staging\" area for ripped Blu-ray content, and sometimes it's too much effort to rename them straight away, and it's likely they'll get caught in a backup and duplicated, which could waste lots of backup storage\n \n If I'm right, ZFS should be a solid file system choice for the backups server. My concern though is I could dedicate about 8GB of RAM to it, which is well below the suggestions I hear\n Failing all this, I guess I'll just try one of the mentioned softwares\n    submitted by    /u/KoolKarmaKollector  \n [link]   [comments]",

Another consideration is exporting and backing up the data and especially media from a site like that. We can use those sites mainly just for research purposes.\n \nI was thinking about using GitHub for the gencom file since it is simple text data, not public if you don’t want, users can have specific edit permissions, merges have to be reviewed before publishing, and there is versioning history, and backs up offline\n \nBut gencom allows for storing links to media content. What is the safest and most cost-effective way to archive all of this data for offline and also allow users to add new sources (not remove existing ones)?

The main use is an \"oh shit\" something went horribly wrong backup. \n So, I was wondering, before I delete my backup and give it a spin, has it matured more on windows? How does it compare, or maybe there's something even better than both. Crashplan was still amazing and then got killed very soon after I used it sadly, and ARQ was the closest because of the real time scanning, but yeah, not working because it couldn't properly respect the destination size limits was a no go.\n    submitted by    /u/XOIIO  \n [link]   [comments]",

The other 50-60% is a plethora of videos I downloaded from YouTube (using a 3rd party app) and other websites.\n The content of the videos range from fan-made music videos of popular songs, specific movie scenes and dialogue, episodes of certain TV shows, etc. Pretty much anything that I found to be of personal value to myself.\n SITUATION: I want to create shareable embedded links of the videos to paste them inside my Notion page(s), to have a place where I can quickly watch and refer to them when needed. I do not wish to upload these videos directly onto Notion.\n Problem is, that half of my video collection is technically copyrighted material. Having that inside my G-Drive and sharing it with an embedded sharelink, could have my account flagged and banned. \n I do have a Synology NAS DS218+ which I recently purchased and have implemented G-Sync with. But I am still learning the ins and out of operating a personal NAS. And don't want to experiment with creating links to and from my NAS like that.\n    submitted by    /u/JacobDaGoat7  \n [link]   [comments]",

Had a planned backup for a 400GB file today and plugged the hard drive in. I copied and transferred the folder over and left to let it so its thing. \n However I came back 10mins later to an error message. \"Error 0x800701b1. An unexpected error is keeping you from copying this file....\" For some reason my wireless mouse had failed at the same time, and my PC had hanged/lagged? I almost had to force shut down my PC.

I am also not entirely sure this will even have any effect on my server given the harware acceleration, dual cache drives and other rando specs of the system.\n ​\n maybe i can use this in place of one of my two parity drives? since i think the lower performance wont matter as much for the parity drives right? and i can add one of the faster parity drives to the main array\n ​\n in case anyone wants to see some of the specs of the drive i got as a return\n    submitted by    /u/sk8rseth  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi all, after reading a ton on here and living through a decade of my Drobo. It's time to sunset my 5D (I had a 4D before that). It's flaky and i can't even see it on my Drobo dashboard anymore. Luckily, I can still see the fie, but I know I'm on borrowed time.\n I've been actively considering a Sinology NAS or an OWC DAS answer. Since I'm likely to from from CrashPlan/Code42 to Backblaze, I need a DAS solution. Crashplan is like Drobo for my cloud backup. I'm so mad. \n Can someone sanity check my logic/ thinking:\n I think I've settled. I'm going to get an OWC T-bday 4 with 24TB total. That should get me 18TB of storage which should last 2-4 years at least. At that point, i'll probably buy another 4bay (or get an 8 bay and effective run two 4's inside. My photo archive is' a little under 12TB today and that' most of what will be on there\n It comes configured with Raid 5, but OWC rep said RAID 4 was better for media. I'm not sure there's a big difference and I'm inclined to keep it \"as it comes\". \n FWIW - I work locally and only use the external for storage and re-accessing photos over time. So performance isn't a huge issue on the volume itself. I just need to to be reliable and store my stuff with some reduncy.\n It sounds like the soft-RAID they provide will also work well. The downside is that I'll go down to single disk redundancy. My Drobo currently allows two drives to fail before i'm screwed. However, Drobo itself is a failure, so I'm not sure that's much solace. \n Any reactions or caveats? I'm probably going to order it today if not.\n Essentially: * TBay 4 - 24TB model with enterprise drives * SoftRaid - keep as delivered with RAID 5 * Live my life.\n Am I missing anything big?\n kb\n    submitted by    /u/kbevphoto  \n [link]   [comments]",

Given 'old' hardware is now stuff like Haswell are 10 years old now, supporting up to 32GB of DDR3-1866 Memory and even support M.2\n This hardware is more than capable of being used as a NAS. But most Boards & CPU's don't support ECC, so I'm wondering why we can't use software to mitigate a lack of ECC memory?

I've currently got a couple 4TB drives in RAID1 on OpenMediaVault, but it's filling up fast. After some research, I was planning on making an offsite NAS for redundancy.\n I figured a RAID6 of like 16TB each Seagate Exos drives would be okay for offsite redundancy, it has two drives that can fail, and can hold a lot of data on a smaller number of drives (was going to start with four, and possibly go to as many as six, depending on my usage. Since it's offsite, I wanted it to be as low-maintenance as possible)\n I was then going to set up my home NAS in a raid 5 of some smaller size also on OMV (6TB a drive, for example.) I figure it's less safe, but will still have a drive failure supported, as well as faster reads for the same amount of storage as compared to a larger drive.\n With the offsite redundancy, I'm not sure if that would count as a backup, or if I should have a tertiary option somewhere. I've only ever done cold storage for single disk backups, I'm not sure how that would work with say 25+TB of data.\n Is my proposed implementation stable? Are there any things I've overengineered, or should do differently within the limitations of only having 8 bays in my local system? I don't plan on filling them all at once, I figured the 3 drives minimum for a raid 5 and 4 minimum of a raid six should hold me over for maybe a year, unless it's better to create the max size array at once, to cut down on syncing?\n    submitted by    /u/thextallxdude  \n [link]   [comments]",

I've essentially highlighted all the folders on the Seagate and copy/pasted them over to the Synology through the network folders, but what I've now realised is this is taking the data from the Seagate and sending it through my computer, which then passes it to the Synology - not exactly the most efficient way of doing things and is taking its sweet time.\n I don't suppose there's a way to do this in a more direct manner, through the interfaces of each NAS instead so that they can just talk to one another directly on the network rather than using the computer as an intermediary? I did have a look around, but couldn't find a solution.

Obviously it won't be that hot most of the time, but if my vehicle is getting direct sun exposure all day in the summer, I can't have things crash. My Pepwave routers (formerly ubr lte, now br2 max pro) handle the conditions fine.\n So then the game is about finding the cheapest SSDs. Ruling out the stuff the stuff that's obviously fraud, the best deal seems to be 2.5\" NVME U.2 drives, with several 7.68 tb models in the $400 range.\n From what I can tell, u.2 and m.2 are electronically compatible, and you \"simply\" need the appropriate cabling / adapters to go between the two. So rather than run some massive (and power hungry) server which natively runs u.2 drives, I can put the drives in dumb enclosures, get some U2 to M2 adapters, and connect them to something like the QNAP m.2 \"nasbook\" with the adapters.\n This would get me 32TB of SSD storage right around $2000, with a device that I can power directly off my DC electrical system. Am I missing anything? Is there a better / cheaper way to accomplish this?\n No, I don't care about performance - not in any meaningful sense.

While anybody is free to download the source code, it will not build without a valid DevExpress WinForms license.\n If anyone has read this disclaimer and still has an interest in contributing to the project, I'll be more than happy to work with you.\n Thank you all so much for your support earlier this year.

It's accessible just fine on my home LAN, either through [hostname].local:[port] or through Synology QuickConnect, but if I try to connect through my domain, it just displays the standard \"Your website is not set up yet\" splash page that it usually shows when webstation isn't set up properly, and if I try to use QuickConnect, it just won't connect at all. I have port forwarding set up on my router for the relevant port, and I plan to eventually set up ssl for the jellyfin instance, but for now I just want it to connect at all.\n I don't have much experience with networking (I started and didn't finish a CS degree) and I'm frankly all out of ideas.

I recently ordered a new Mac studio that will serve as my new mothership for work and all my personal/important files... but I still want to repurpose this old rig as a standalone plex server (and possible blue iris backup) since the hardware is still solid and the processor supports quicksync for hw transcoding (I'll probably upgrade the ram, psu, and move from sata cards to HBA, but i digress...) Here's my conundrum though.\n Part of me really wants to transition from this shameful jbod array with ~36TB of media to a more modern and manageable Unraid setup... however I'd have to ditch my cloud backup. B2 storage for this amount of stuff is prohibitively expensive for just a plex server. However, if I stay jbod on a standard desktop operating system (macos/windows/linux) I can keep all my data backed up on backblaze's desktop plan for 7 bucks a month. \n Do I really need a cloud backup for this media?

I was thinking keeping them, but calculating for storage, backup and stuff, recently I'm about changing my mind. If I purge my library from unusable stuff, I'll have around some thousand pics instead of the 40k I currently have (from most of which aren't good), and I wouldn't need to be concerned about storage and backup for a while (reducing my 2TB of images to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-200GB, which I can totally support with the current home and cloud infrastructure I use (inc. kept raw files).\n What do you guys think? \n If there are any photographers/videographers here, what do you do with kind of useless material?

          "description": "I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post this, so very sorry if this feels a bit out of place. \n I use a MBP 2021, so a macOS user but do have access to a parallels VM incase I need to use Windows programs. I have multiple HDDs and an SSD, but today an HDD I've used for around 5-6yrs started getting disconnected from my laptop with high frequency. And it was abysmally slow, the last time I checked it could only do 5mbps write when data wasn't being read/written to it in the background.\n I knew that the HDD was in its last legs, but I procrastinated over getting a new one just because I was naive and new to hoarding data. I quickly ran over to a store and bought a new 2TB WD HDD. \n Now I've spent a few hours trying to switch my data, but it shows an estimated time to copy of about 20-45mins for a 500-700mb file. If I kept this pace, it'd take me like a week to transfer everything over, and doing a transfer like that freezes Finder even when I'm trying to move and browse through files even on my laptops on board SSD. I know that the bottleneck here is just the fact that my HDD is old AF and there's not much I can do except just move the files over a long period of time. But I came here looking for something that could help me in future if not now.\n Is there any way to make this painfully slow process even a bit more efficient and quicker? I'm currently using Finder's drag and drop copy paste feature.\n Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/GamingGamer182  \n [link]   [comments]",

Well, not “if.” I’m sorry that this is definitely a noob question.\n I have been trying to wrap my brain around ripping our large collection of dvds, Blu-ray’s, and 4K movies. \n Maybe I’m dumb but my brain is hurting. I’ve watched YouTube tutorials and all that and I still can’t seem to find the “ELI5” tutorial I need to figure out what hardware and software I need. \n Has anyone on this sub done a very simple tutorial? I searched past threads and can’t find just a simple tutorial, mainly I just find threads troubleshooting issues I don’t understand yet because I haven’t gotten that far. \n Alternatively if anyone lives in Utah I will drive my collection to you and pay you to do this for me lol. Whatever you charge is probably worth it to me.

I've tried every combination of setting in the book and I can't get it to work.\n My config is 2XSSD 2-column mirror + 7XHDD 5-column parity on Win10 for Workstations. It sets up the tiers properly but then only allows the HDD tier to be used at 50% efficiency. Looking at individual disk IO I can see that it's striping only two disks instead of 5. Something seems to be forcing the config into mirror-mirror instead of mirror-parity.\n Please note that I'm talking about Storage Spaces, not Storage Spaces Direct. I've scoured the MS documentation and the internet and can't find any reference to Storage Spaces not supporting mirror-accelerated parity but it's Microsoft so who knows? Even MS tech support can't find a definitive answer for me as to whether Win 10/11 supports this.\n Have any of you ever gotten this setup working and, if so, how the hell did you manage it?\n Thanks!\n P.S. - And, with all due respect, please don't just suggest that I dump Storage Spaces and use some other product.

I figured it might be worth a shot given the nature of the situation.\n I'm trying to digitise a small handful of VHS tapes. My original plan was to plug my VCR into the Xbox One via an AV-HDMI adapter/upscaler, and then use OneCast to connect from my computer and just do a screen cap. The problem now is that Microsoft have locked down the OneGuide app that takes in HDMI input and doesn't allow apps like OneCast to stream from that app anymore (same with apps like YouTube etc.). Maybe somebody knows of a different app that can capture an Xbox stream?\n Short of buying a capture card, are there any ways around this? Having a device in front of me with HDMI in and out, plus a 2-way AV-HDMI adapter, plus a VCR and a computer is making me think there has to be a solution with what I have.\n Again, I know the most obvious solution is \"buy a capture card\". I'm just trying to work with what I have at the moment. And if I do end up needing to purchase one, what would be your (budget) suggestions?

Use tapes. To set the stage I am looking at this from a \"per-project\" standpoint not a \"backup my entire storage infra\" standpoint. \n I think would easily be able to fit a entire project (wedding, event, concert, etc...) on a single LTO-5 tape. With that I would double up and mirror the tapes and then just have them in a decent (but not great, admittedly) climate controlled environment for potential future access for up to 2-3 years after the project. So effectively I keep the \"good\" raw's and clips on my main storage array and then offload all of the project as a snapshot onto 2 identical tapes (original files, project files, and final exports).\n My goal is to reduce the spinning disks I need to maintain, decrease power usage, and decrese the space utilization of one off projects that I will likely never need to touch again, and still maintain that data for as long a possable for my own comfort and client good will. \n I am thinking I can find a LTO external SAS drive for ~$350, tapes for ~$9 per, and use something like bacula to manage the tapes.\n Thoughts?\n    submitted by    /u/kd5vmo  \n [link]   [comments]",

Problem is, it is a lot of random folders, some with discographies, some with separate albums, all in different formats, with a lot of broken tags and some other weirdness. I'd want to back all this up in a more organized format: something like a bunch of \"artist/album\" folders, with all the files in a single format (AAC, maybe?) for file compression. \n For that, I've tried using SoundConverter. While it does work, more or less, it is quite bugged - sometimes it just puts files in random places, it can't handle album icons, and when there are issues with tags (No tags, tags with spelling issues, tags with encoding issues, you name it) it does weird things. \n I thought about trying to hack around some Python to do that for me, but I feel that it is a problem which is probably solved already.

          "description": "Hello!\n I like running a command to essentially mirror my 6TB drive to another identical 6TB drive every week or two. For now, I prefer it to RAID. The command is set up to only mirror files that have been changed, rather than copying EVERYTHING each time. Th initial mirror back in the day was a big one, but all subsequent ones just update what's been changed.\n The issue I have is that the destination drive ends up with less available space than the source drive, even though they should be identical in size after the mirror.\n Currently, the source drive shows 276GB/5.45TB free, while the destination drive shows 178GB/5.45TB free.\n If I click into each drive and manually check all the file sizes, they come out identical, yet somehow the drive summary graph always shows higher usage on the destination drive.\n I have hidden files being shown, including protected OS files. I should note that both drives are separate from the OS drive, and only used to store media files.\n I don't have any compressed files on either drive. Both drives have a cluster size of 4096 Bytes, with 512 Bytes per sector.\n I'm just stuck scratching my head as to why the drives show different file sizes. It's like there's a super-hidden file somewhere on the Destination Drive, but I can't find it. Any guidance is appreciated!\n EDIT: Here is the RoboCopy command for reference: robocopy P: B: /mir /v\n    submitted by    /u/PixelPerfect636  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.\n I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.\n The data I'm storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.\n I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it's worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.\n I'd appreciate any feedback on this topic. \n Many thanks :)\n    submitted by    /u/carrot0202  \n [link]   [comments]",

While digging through a large box of VHS tapes I realized I hadn’t seen most of these sleeves in 20+ years and felt they would be a good candidate to scan and upload to archive.org. I have the first 6 scanned and uploaded. Sadly most of the tapes have molded and with only 1 of 4 VCRs working I can’t risk playing a moldy tape. It’s sad as there are several marked as Bulls games from the early 90’s that would be awesome to have as the original broadcast.\n Link for anybody interested \n <iframe src=\"https://archive.org/embed/sony-es-t-120-dynamicron-extra-superior-standard-grade-video-cassette\" width=\"560\" height=\"384\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n    submitted by    /u/JL85FW  \n [link]   [comments]",

My telecine files for that 2.5 minute reel are typically about 85GB (6.5k resolution, HDR). As one does with analog film, long term preservation of the film itself and the original telecine files is important. I'm looking to burn these video files to BDXL MDISC and keep them offsite, to help support the 3-2-1 rule.\n Question: What is the best type of marker to use when labeling discs for long term archival storage? I know Sharpies are a no-no because they fade with time, but how about something like a Sakura Pigma Micron Pen, since they claim to be pigment based and archival in nature.

An easily replaced fan on one and the other one starting being flakey. \n These are the prices they were several years ago before the USB-C models came out and the price jumped, partially because of product confusion between the old and new models.\n https://www.amazon.com/Mediasonic-PROBOX-SATA-Drive-Enclosure/dp/B09WPPJHSS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2RYFII0I2LNHI&keywords=mediasonic+probox&qid=1665885852&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjcyIiwicXNhIjoiMy4yNyIsInFzcCI6IjIuNTUifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=mediasonic+probox%2Caps%2C732&sr=8-1\n https://www.amazon.com/Mediasonic-PROBOX-3-5-inch-Drive-Enclosure/dp/B09V3TGDFW/ref=sr_1_2?crid=2RYFII0I2LNHI&keywords=mediasonic+probox&qid=1665886065&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjcyIiwicXNhIjoiMy4yNyIsInFzcCI6IjIuNTUifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=mediasonic+probox%2Caps%2C732&sr=8-2\n    submitted by    /u/Far_Marsupial6303  \n [link]   [comments]",

I plan on adding 2 more 8tb drives in the near future. My use case for this will be a Plex server with a few Docker containers and a small SMB share. Unraid seems to be a great option, with the ability to expand your pools later on. While TrueNAS has ZFS and you don't have to have a USB as a critical part of your system. The downside is I would not be able to add the drives to a ZFS pool when I purchase them down the line. I really like the idea of using Unraid but the USB thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about it. I've read some comparison articles but none of them have been able to sway me in either direction. I appreciate any help you can offer or guidance towards the correct decision.\n    submitted by    /u/reactivesayswhat  \n [link]   [comments]",

Discord has replaced forums as a platform for exchanging information on specific topics. These forums are fortunately largely covered by e.g. the Wayback-Machine. The problem is that Discord is quite closed and can't be easily archived.\n ​\n How can the whole thing be done?\n Me and a friend have thought about something. We have developed a website and a discord bot. Every server admin can index his server with the bot. On Search-Cord.com you can search all messages in a few milliseconds. The usernames no longer contain #tags so that no users can be contacted against their will.\n The current state:\n Currently we have about 20 servers with a total of about 3 million messages archived?\n ​\n What about opensource?\n The complete source code can be found on Github.\n What if someone does not want their messages to be in the archive?\n On the website you can autentify yourself with discord and then delete all messages from the archive and put yourself on a blacklist to prevent future messages from being archived.\n    submitted by    /u/calvinwaran  \n [link]   [comments]",
