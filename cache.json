I also want to be able to give new star ratings when I get more music.\n The last time I had a good self-hosted music setup was when my ipod classic still worked. I occasionally synced my ipod with itunes on a Windows machine via USB.\n I tried out Jellyfin, but their android app for playing music is too buggy, and there's no way to assign star ratings or make smart playlists.\n I'm thinking of giving Kodi a shot, and hope that maybe there's a plug-in or something that will let me give star ratings and keep track of play counts and date last played, the way itunes used to.\n Background:\n The server is running Debian, and the Kodi docs warn of extra complications with Kodi and Debian. I'm not sure if I should worry about that or if it won't matter because the clients aren't on Debian.\n The clients will either be Android-based devices, or some flavor of Ubuntu.\n Questions:\n  \nShould I go with a different back end for the server, or use the one built into Kodi?\n Should I forget about Kodi and look at some other client/server combination?\n  \nI will be adding movies, photos, and home videos to the server, but satisfying my music library needs is most important.\n There are so many options and combinations that I'm just hoping to get some general direction.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/LeornToCodeLOL  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I am slowly getting into self hosting. I have made a TrueNAS SCALE machine that, so far, just serves as a media server. I use, and have used, Plex heavily for years, movies and shows only.\n I am getting into organizing and serving other media I use less frequently:\n  \nPhotos, Images\n Audiobooks\n Podcasts\n Comic books\n  \nI'm ready to tackle the next content on my list: photos & images. I frequently see two self-hosted solutions recommended here: Photoprism and Plex photos to a lesser extent. \n I recall a couple years ago Plex ended the phone auto-upload capability, which fed into its Photo libraries. However, I see nextcloud+plex recommended as a means to sync photos from phones to plex. I like plex's built-in abilities to serve content outside of my local network. On the other hand, should I be concerned that plex will pull the plug on the photos feature completely?\n Photoprism seems to have some extra capabilities such as feature/face recognition. The UI is unfamiliar at the moment though.\n I definitely want to use something with a native docker build in the truenas scale \"app\" libraries to keep things simple. I think I would like to, at a minimum, separate my libraries into photos and images (for things like digital art).\n Which approach would be best for a self hosting beginner with the above needs? Anything obvious I'm not considering? How big a deal is putting another \"egg in the basket\" by relying on Plex to handle another media type vs. diversifying into other applications?\n    submitted by    /u/build_time  \n [link]   [comments]",

Now here is my job file for pihole:\n ```hcl job \"pihole\" { datacenters = [\"dc1\"]\n group \"pihole\" {\n network { mode = \"cni/mynet\" port \"http\" { static = 80 to = 80 } port \"DNS\" { static = 53 to = 53 } } task \"pihole\" { driver = \"docker\" env { TZ = \"Europe/Budapest\" VIRTUAL_HOST = \"pi.hole\" PROXY_LOCATION = \"pi.hole\" FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 = \"127.0.0.1\" WEBPASSWORD = \"piholepass\" } config { image = \"pihole/pihole:latest\" ports = [\"http\", \"DNS\"] ipv4_address = \"172.22.0.2\" volumes = [ \"/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole\", \"/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d\", ] } } \n } }\n ```\n If I use network.mode = \"bridge\" and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine.

These 3 users will only ever access those two plex focused services. \n I also want to expose about 10-15 services including the two plex ones above to 3 different users. Does this mean I need 2 different dashboards/sites for each user group?\n I thought maybe a reverse proxy (traefik) with authentication? (Authelia) put services behind wireguard to link to my VPN? Do I need something to handle certificates? Lets encrypt ? Cloud flare tunnels? So confused. \n What's the least complex way to do this and what order do I go in (maybe Traefik then wireguard then ???) Trying to figure out the boot/compose order so everything is ready before the next service starts up. Right \n I have a domain name that I bought but how to use it Suggestions, links, guides anything to help put these pieces together is appreciated.\n    submitted by    /u/TheLstMerlin  \n [link]   [comments]",

All the apps that rely on \"outside access\" (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan <-> router (pppoe) <-> lan <-> nginx reverse proxy <-> apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns \"autobots\".\n In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started \"falling off\" from my services. My phone wouldn't sync with NextCloud, people's locations didn't update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if \"my\" domains were \"listed\" on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren't propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).\n I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.\n Does anyone know what's going on?

I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. \n The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.\n This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I'd like to play with kubernetes a bit. I've already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.\n However, I still don't understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I'd assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.\n If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.\n Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server?

          "description": "I'm currently accessing my self hosted applications through a VPN (ZeroTier). The problem with this approach is that each user that wants to use a service, or even myself, needs to join the ZT network, and have it enabled. Even if other people were not to use the network, it's still bothersome to me, since the ZT network on my phone consumes a lot of battery, and all the traffic is going through it which I'm not too fond of.\n So the option is obviously opening ports. However this has security risks which I don't want to have, and I began looking for alternatives. It seems that a tunnel with Cloudflare would be a good option, but there's some thing I want to understand about it.\n Cloudflare seems to simplify security, since they automatically detect and block suspicious connections, and they offer many tools to manually restrict connections with various arbitrary filters. However, let's say that there's some services I self host that I want to allow everyone to access, and there's some others that I want to restrict to selected users, how risky is this? Isn't a chain as strong as its weakest link?\n If I have an application open to the public, couldn't a vulnerability in that application compromise my entire network? Assume each application is running on its own docker container of course.\n I use a reverse proxy with nginx to access each service with a subdomain. Does Cloudflare limit my ability to do this in any way? I saw that I may need to add applications one by one, can I use a wildcard redirect or something?\n And also, does Cloudflare have data limits and speed limits? Since all my traffic would be going through them via the tunnel... I guess this is par for the course. It would really suck if that's the case, but I guess deep down I already know the answer.\n Thanks!\n    submitted by    /u/SnooPets20  \n [link]   [comments]",

The *arr, Jellyfin, Heimdall, Calibre-web, Dazzle, Portainer, Duplicati, Vaultwarden, Watchtower, VPN client and 2 VPN connected download services and others.\n Portainer is run separately and all other services in a docker-compose (a stack in Portainer).\n The domain name and subdomains are managed by Synology.\n I want to add Swag instead of Synology's reverse proxy. Because I have to open a lot of firewall ports to make it work with Synology's reverse proxy and I don't like it.\n After that, I want to use Home Assistant because I have many sensors in my apartment.\n Then add a Grafana to monitoring the services.\n And Authelia or Authentik\n So the stack is starting to have a lot of services. And I'm wondering if I should separate it or not. But I can't think of any good reasons. And if I do. Do I have to manage 2 watchtower services and 2 swags? One per stack?\n ​\n Sorry for the language.\n Thx for the sharing\n    submitted by    /u/kojimi-1331  \n [link]   [comments]",

I had to make a very painful data loss a few days ago due to an update error from NextCloudPi and had no backup for some now lost files.\n This now brings me to the point that I finally want to think about a backup strategy and I definitely need your help. I've always read a lot about this, but couldn't really do anything with it because it was too abstract.\n What is the current status?\n I have a RAID 1 system with 2x 4TB NAS hard drives connected to my Ubuntu server. I never expected that a software error could delete all my cloud files, but now I've been proven wrong. I don't do automated backups at all. At most, I manually copy the most important things to an external hard drive every few months.\n The file system is ext4.\n What I know could be helpful\n I know for example that there is btrfs as a file system and there is snapshot, but there it already starts, because I do not understand the functionality. Could that have helped me in my case where all the files were deleted? Then I know that there is rsync, which does more or less the same thing that RAID 1 already does (if I understood correctly).\n ​\n Of course, it would also be very efficient to save the data again on an external hard drive, for example. But I don't know how this can be automated, because it would have to be connected all the time, which would quickly exceed the life of the hard drive. I definitely want to keep everything local and not fall back on external cloud providers such as Mega, Google, OneDrive, etc.\n ​\n So let's first discuss the best realization in my case and possibly afterward how the whole thing is technically feasible. I want to make a backup of everything and not only of the data in the cloud but also of the rest. Thank you very much in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/CptDayDreamer  \n [link]   [comments]",

(By researching I found that accessing your local network through a vpn seems to be the easiest and most secure method).\n tl;dr: first I need to learn how to put domains on my local network instead of accessing the services by ip address and port. \n e.g dashboard: 192.168.1.70:8080 -> homer.pi \n 192.168.1.70:9000 -> portainer.pi\n I didn't find any guide for noobs, I just saw that I can do it through the pi-hole but I can't direct to the ports, only to one address.\n https://preview.redd.it/r6lb7ewqvwq91.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=8baeb3856000af84ed151f85b053a76c6f8bdb7d\n    submitted by    /u/SmokingSnakeBRA  \n [link]   [comments]",

I posted this before on here, but I cleaned the text up now and made the problem easier to understand, so I'm posting again. I'd appreciate any help on this as I'm really at my wits' end here.\n I'd like to use the NginxProxyManager container and have it only accessible when I connect to the server via Wireguard. But I can't get it working.\n My configurations files are: - Wireguard compose file - NginxProxyManager compose file - What my firewall is currently like\n After deploying the previously mentioned files, I copied the Wireguard peer configuration into the app on my computer and connected to it. The issue is that nothing is accessible. I can't Google anything, I can't ping anything, and doing localhost:81 or server-ip:81 does nothing as well.\n I don't think it's a firewall issue either, as when I disable it on my server and try to access any site on my computer there's no change.\n Here are the Wireguard and peer configuration files, with all keys redacted: - Wireguard configuration file - Peer configuration file\n I don't know if it's relevant but the proxy network in docker has a subnet of 172.18.0.0/16 and a gateway of 172.18.0.1.\n I feel like the issue may be the AllowedIPs section in wg0.conf but I'm not sure, plus since I have a dynamic IP how would I even have it in a form where I don't need to keep on editing it every time my IP changes?\n    submitted by    /u/mktoGBA  \n [link]   [comments]",

Just shipped a product called Gardens: https://joingardens.com/apps. 📷\n PaaS (platform-as-a-service) refers to a model where the service helps you provision and run a platform for hosting apps and/or apps themselves without the hassle usually associated with it.\n New PaaS solutions show up pretty often, but they're either proprietary, lock you in, or aren't friendly for non-developers.Gardens solves all of that. Here's what it does:\n  - Makes setting up your own PaaS with an admin panel and setting up apps easy as cake. You don't need to know how to code; there's a library of 130+ apps available. They're set up in one click\n  - Does not lock you in. Your data as well as the PaaS application itself (Caprover) stays in your cloud. We support DigitalOcean but will add more providers soon\n - Has social features. While the whole self-hosting infra stays on your cloud, the main site features step-by-step guides and posts from big open-source companies to help find and share knowledge\n Curious to hear what the community here thinks! Gardens is open-source on Github, and accepting feature requests. Hope you'll like it!\n    submitted by    /u/joingardens  \n [link]   [comments]",

My reasoning for this is I've been using Nginx Proxy Manager for the last 6 months or so, and in that time, I've had multiple instances of it just.. Failing outright. The docker container will be running, but traffic will not flow whatsoever. I've also had issues with SSL certs not renewing, as well as not issuing. I can't keep having my services go down and reverting backups on the main server, rebuilding the container, or having to roll back updates/push new updates constantly to try and fix the problem.\n Recently, I had it fail again, and am unable to get it working whatsoever. I switched back to good old Nginx basic, writing the configs manually and setting it up, and it works fine.\n I'm looking for an alternative with a GUI. I don't want to go back to command line and writing configs manually. I'm just too tired of having to pray that Nginx Proxy Manager will work, or having to roll back to get it working again.\n Please suggest some alternatives with a GUI and ideally docker based as I'm running this on a Windows machine.\n Thanks all!\n    submitted by    /u/FatalVengeance  \n [link]   [comments]",

Suppose you want to host e.g. a Nextcloud, Bitwarden, etc. on your own server but have no idea about setting up the infrastructure. Is there a tool (or even a paid service) with which you can deploy the application (+ web server and so on) on your host with just a few clicks without necessarily depending on a provider? All this without additional software and via a frontend that guides me through the necessary steps?\n ​\n I am well aware that you have to take care of the connection from the tool to my host for example.

With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don't care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.\n Now, I've installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it's really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. \n So my questions are: \n 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? \n 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).\n 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?\n 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?\n Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out.

          "description": "Hi all,\n I have an HP envy laptop with i7-10510U and 16gb ram and 500GB SSD (even has a discrete 250MX nvidia GPU).\n It is currently mostly unused, I was running proxmox on it for some time with a few VMs and containers, but currently thinking of migrating to TrueNAS Scale, the obvious problem with a laptop that there are no sata ports (or expandability in general is very limited).\n So in order to really benefit zfs and use it as a proper NAS, the only way it seems is using some sort USB enclosures/dockings for SATA HDDs/SSDs, but I'm not sure if that's a decent option.\n Note: there's a USB-C port which can act as a display port / charging / data - perhaps there are some things for storage I can plug in there as a more reliable alternative to \"just regular\" USB-A ports?\n Note2: The data stored on it is not super critical, mostly family photos and some movies etc. and I'm backing up automatically to Backblaze anyway, so things like ECC memories and edge cases are not really a concern.\n Alternative option:\n I have a tower gaming PC which is running pretty much 24/7 anyway, so I could through in a bunch of HDDs, and run TrueNAS scale in hyper-v. Though that leaves the laptop without a purpose really, and it has more than decent hardware for a home server.\n What do you suggest?\n Thanks\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_World_4148  \n [link]   [comments]",

(Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&T's stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I'm (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. \n I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren't officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, or if there's better solutions for a side gig.\n    submitted by    /u/m70b1jr  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was quite fluent on HP UX and whatever applications we used to use back in the day. Life happened and I went to the Dark Side and became a manager\n Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I'm kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)\n I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal\n I don't have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus\n Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant\n Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started. Does this sounds reasonable?\n Any other help of pointers you guys can give me are much appreciated\n    submitted by    /u/DearAd3335  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have gotten very interested in citrix storefront (web ui) and citrix desktop (Essentially bringing a vm to another device). Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM's or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. \n Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can't be the whole solution because it can't autocreate/allocate VM's for users and doesn't shutdown when not not in use. Doesn't help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can't auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically\n I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly. But sometimes I wish I could just spin up a VM with an easier user interface or create a new user with a VM already allocated that could be connected to easily.\n    submitted by    /u/TeraBot452  \n [link]   [comments]",

Got a Lenovo T470 that isn't currently doing much, got a RaspberryPi 4 that isn't doing much, I could also spin up a VM on proxmox to act as a bastion.\n Option 3: Jump server. This one honestly seems a bit overkill and superfluous.

So fiber it is but im kind of walking into it blind so here I am turning to the smart people of reddit.\n ​\n  \nI have unifi gear, does ubiquiti have their own transceivers? or do they just use the same ones? format? standard? as someone else like cisco?\n  \n​\n  \n multimode LC is the best for what i want right? (long 10g run through conduit)\n  \n​\n  \n do i need to find the distance and buy the correct length? and if so where? fs.com? or do i want to learn how to terminate fiber.. which from what ive seen isnt rly something you just.. do.\n  \n​\n  \nhow far under the rated distance can I be before i risk burning out the receiver?.\n  \n​\n i think thats all, thank you all in advance.\n    submitted by    /u/Lukas245  \n [link]   [comments]",

And I just setup jellyfin on it and then I wondered if I could put a GPU inside the server. Hopefully this server already have x16 pci riser so I could put any gpu I wanted. But I noticed that this server doesn't have any extra plug to add more powerful GPU like some server do. \n So at first my head turned over my collection of old GPU, and I wonder if any of them could help in that regards (even just a little bit):\n  \nATI RADEON HD X1300\n ATI RADEON HD 2400 PRO\n ATI RADEON HD 2400XT\n ATI RADEON HD 3450\n ATI RADEON HD 6350\n NVIDIA QUADRO FX 370\n NVIDIA GEFORCE 6200TC\n NVIDIA 7300GS\n NVIDIA 8400GS\n  \nThe Radeon 6350 is the most recent of the bunch if i'm not mistaken, but I don't know if it is useful or not in this scenario.\n I'm also wondering what if I buy a new GPU, what is the best cheap GPU for this purpose (used or new) Should I buy an older quadro ? Should I buy a 1030 or 1650 ? And what would be the downside of each ?\n Thank you for any help ! Have a nice day !\n    submitted by    /u/Kraftingg  \n [link]   [comments]",

It's hosting Homeassistant (OS) , Jellyfin, LMS/Subsonic and Piwigo, each on separate guest machines (I know I could run them all in docker, but.. I don't wanna).\n My thoughts are to replace the ML with either a couple of HP Elite or ProDesk minis for a slight processing upgrade, or a single Beelink SER with a Ryzen 5 or 7 for a bigger bump. Prices are roughly comparable for 2x micro business desktops or one beefier Beelink. Think around $500 CAD.\n I don't need dual NICs (or >1Gbps), don't need more GPU grunt than the iGPUs, and 32GB ram is plenty for the use case, so expandability isn't a concern. \n Your thoughts on mini business DTs vs Beelink (or similar) mini-pcs?\n    submitted by    /u/uprightanimal  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only issue is I live in a small apartment and this Dell unit I bought is way nosier than I could've imagined. I explored immersion cooling and quite server cabinets (cuz I am a noise freak) but the price for both of these were quite hefty and opening a brand new dell storage to do DIY cooling in 4u is also not an option because it messes up with the warranty and same thing is almost true with immersion cooling as well.\n So, in the end, I found myself thinking more about different spaces in…",

Only problem is, I have no idea what to make of the connectors, since while I know that only two wires connect each socket (we have a similar system to BT's here in the walls, however it is wired differently, with the red wire at pin 3 and the blue wire at pin 4), I cannot seem to understand how to test points that have 4 wires connected (two at the top, two at the bottom).\n Of course, I have disconnected the home phone and the DSL (technically VDSL2, with support for at least profile 30a, perhaps profile 35b, although it only has a 100Mbps RJ-45 port) modem/wired router beforehand, and only reconnected them to post this.\n Here is a picture to illustrate what I mean: https://0x0.st/o49r.jpg (I cannot seem to upload to IMGUR with Sync for Reddit)\n I do plan to replace all of our BT sockets with RJ-11 sockets, just to make troubleshooting far easier, since most equipment cannot connect directly to BT for testing (I also need to test cables, after all), with LeGrand's modules making things easier for me there (I will be running both CAT5e for phone and CAT6A for networking, in preparation for my future homelab, after all), and for that I first need to ascertain what plugs where, especially since I need to move where the DSL modem/wired-router is physically connected.\n    submitted by    /u/moriel5  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "[2022-09-29-Network-Layout.png](https://postimg.cc/k2tGxzgJ)\n Hey guys - current config is internet into my Asus router, which has been great but it's reached end-of-software-support and my (wired) network is getting too big for it, so I've roped in another wifi router with NAT turned off to give me +4 RJ45 ports... not ideal. \n So anyway, I just built a pfSense box and I have a 24-port Cisco 3560 I found in the trash at work. So my plan is as in the linked image at top:\n Internet into pfSense, then on into the Cisco (SFP port 1). SFP port 2 of the Cisco (SFP) will go into the Asus in WAP mode to handle the wifi traffic.\n This page ( https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-vlans-in-pfsense/ ) gives a decent overview of setting up VLANs to segregate traffic but it indicates I'll need to assign VLANs in the switch as well. I can do this but then it begs the question about wireless devices... \n I imagine the \"Trusted Systems\" VLAN devices will have access to each other, the internet, and my file server.\n IOT will have access to each other and pfSense NTP.\n Guest will have access only to the internet.\n Since wireless devices will all be coming into the Cisco through one SFP port, I can't just assign that port to one VLAN; if pfSense is handling DHCP, presumably I can use different subnets for the devices by individually assigning IPs.\n By default, new devices would be part of Guest until moved into Trusted or IOT... which is the gap in my current understanding. \n Thoughts? What am I missing here? Thanks in advance! I'm happy to learn by messing around but since I'll be taking down the entire home network to do this, hopefully it doesn't take too long. ;)\n    submitted by    /u/myfufu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I was under the impression of the latter. \n anti tl;dr: I have two Intel X540s - one in my main PC (Windows 10), one in my server/NAS (Server 2022). Until today they were setup direct-attach. \n Large transfers of single files (> ~5GB) will start out saturating 10 GbE for a bit, drop to zero and hang, then pick back up. It'll repeat it a few times over the course of a transfer. \n On a 60GB mkv it happens about a half dozen times (all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it). Smaller files (< ~5GB) are a non-issue. \n I bought the NICs about two years ago and and tried to figure it out but couldn't and assumed it was a quirk of direct attach. \n Then I got a deal on a 10 GbE switch (Ubiquiti USW-Flex-XG) and set it up today. I made my X540s my primary NICs in each aaaaaaaand the problem is worse. I'm not even hitting 5 GbE, let alone 10 GbE. \n Here's iPerf3 - the result is the same in either direction.\n Here's an actual transfer - all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it. this is to/from an NVME but it happens with any combination of drives (SATA SSDs, RAID 0 HDD array, other NVME). \n The only thing I can come up with is maybe an overheating NIC? the X540 in my server has a 40mm fan strapped on it (because there's room). The X540 in my main PC doesn't have a fan because there's no room for it and the heatsink is lava. but I was under the impression the NIC would drop if it overheats?\n Windows, Intel ProSET, and Ubiquiti all show 10 GbE.

My goal is to have all my games from Steam, Epic, Origin and GOG all installed to a Networked Drive/Folder that's stored on the TrueNAS system, which is then accessible to my 1st and 2nd system.\n Most guides suggest mapping my network drive as normal and installing the games there. This however causes permission issues, which can sometimes be solved by mapping in privileged mode and others, games won't even attempt to start.\n Another option which worked fine was mapping an iSCSI drive. However, this has the problem that only 1 system can access the drive (apparently you can have multiple, but it's highly discouraged?). It also seems it's only really good to set an allocated volume size, not just expand the until the drives get full.

          "description": "(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T, since I still have to decide what CPU to go for, but first I need to fully understand the T-series vs non-T matter)\n Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but relatively mighty NAS (mini-ITX, with Unraid) which is also going to be used as a web server, and one of the \"requirements\" are that it should ideally consume as less power as possible since it's going to stay on 24/7.\n Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:\n  \nTDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T\n frequencies, especially the base frequency\n  \nSo, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it's the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.\n So yeah I understand that the T-series under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.\n My concern is the following.\n When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? \n The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.\n Does this translate in less energy used by the T-series if compared to the non-T when both are subject to the same light load?\n Is this understanding correct, or am I missing anything?\n I'm asking here as there's plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.\n Any advice or insights is really appreciated.\n Thank you very much! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/matteventu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have a handful of local servers, but the only internet facing boxes are the Jellyfin server and Minecraft server. The others (Home Assistant, proxmox, etc.) I am not quite comfortable port forwarding to the open web for security reasons.\n That being said, I would really like to be able to access some of these things from outside of my home network, and I would like to be able to do so safely.\n Obviously RDP is off the table, and I was cautioned against using VNC for similar reasons.

It's got everything from Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, ESXi, Proxmox, Docker, Ubiquiti, MySQL, and Synology, and in-house built apps. Most of the hardware consists of custom build workstations and servers. We have very little that runs in the Cloud. \n I've been a longtime lurker in /r/homelab. I built most of this myself and many of the ideas have come from this group. I'm just at the point now where I need someone to take it over full time. \n The whole lab is accessed remotely by the staff and I need someone who can be there hands on to manage and document it all. Make sure things are backed up, fix/repair broken hardware, do reboots, upgrade/build new workstations as things age, install new software and keep things patched/secure and running. They also need to be organized enough to manage a large volume of data coming in and out of the office on a weekly basis.\n I've posted variations of this to a bunch of job sites and have gotten over 100 resumes to sift through. After a dozen phone screens, no one is coming even close. \n Most resumes are from people who are Tier 1 Helpdesk who do password resets, break fix, and some basic administration; but no one has ever installed anything from scratch. Only 1-2 people have ever built their own computer or know much about hardware, and no one seems to have any experience in Linux or Docker. Not a single resume has highlighted any Homelab experience.\n So, my question is:\n Where do you people look for jobs? Am I asking for too much?

While you can do this, pretty much any legitimate E-mail service out there will immediately flag anything you try sending as spam, or outright refuse to accept your messages in the first place.\n There's a lot of reasons you might want to be able to deliver arbitrary E-mails - not just to yourself, but to others, possibly across disparate E-mail domains.

Basically I want to be able to have a reliable way to send both myself and others who are relevant various alerts and messages.\n Examples:\n  \nI want errors found on ZFS with zed to go to me and a friend,\n I want to design an app that can E-mail a small number of people when I post new content on my Jellyfin server\n I want to have a script send a daily report of some server stats to me.\n I want to have a Web app where a person with an account in my system can submit some kind of job, and when the job has finished an E-mail is sent to the account's stored E-mail address with the results of the job.\n  \nI know that if I were to just, say, create a Gmail account for the purpose, I could configure my apps to connect to Gmail's SMTP and deliver that way, but I'm not sure Google even allows this type of use in the TOS, and even if that's not a concern, it's likely not going to make you look very good when all your E-mail account is doing is sending out obviously auto-generated E-mails on a regular basis.\n How do you guys handle this?\n    submitted by    /u/fmillion  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "I have been tinkering with hardware quite a bit – but some things remain mysteries to me and I finally dare to ask those questions in public. Been trying to read up on them online, but some information is scattered and inconsistent.\n  \nAre SAS hard drives worth it? From what I know internally they're the same as SATA drives and have a physical limit at around ~200 MB/s throughput.\n Why specify SAS' hard drive connections as 6G/12G if throughput is limited to ~200 MB/s anyways?\n SFF-8087 and SFF-8643 are apparently the same electronically, just another physical connector. Is there any difference and can I just use adapters to go from one to the other without performance loss?\n Is there any real world difference between SAS2 6G and SAS3 12G backplanes? From what I understand each SFF-8xxx cable running to the backplane will get one dedicated 6G/12G connection. So serving four drives each that would mean 1,5 Gbps throughput per drive when working with SAS2 6G, right?\n Aren't HBAs limited to 6G anyways? So why even bother with 12G backplanes?\n How do SAS expanders work and what's the performance? This Dell SAS expander seems to expand to 24 drives and connects to another server for JBOD via a single SFF-8088. Do I get 6G/12G for all 24 drives or what's the best way to connect a full array of hard drives without sacrificing performance?\n How do top loaders like 45Drives or Supermicro's 90 drive top loader serve all of the disks? Do they just have 22 HBAs? How do they ensure full performance?\n I assume SAS3 12G is relevant for faster flash storage – but why is it still relevant when everyone talking about NVMes for best performance nowadays?\n  \n   submitted by    /u/Teilchen  \n [link]   [comments]",

The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can't take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.\n I'd like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I'm looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn't support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data.

All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I've been doing this for YEARS, but I've been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. \n All that to ask this....I've been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.\n I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.\n That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I'll just use my existing configs for it, but what I'm NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it's just using OpenVPN, but I'm not sure).\n Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?\n Ultimately, I'd like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don't limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode's IP my public IP.\n Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).\n Am I making this too complicated?

I can't find any near me\n \n Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me.

Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. \n I've considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I'm pretty sure cell towers are a bust. \n The nearest library is nice but it's only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. \n Am I stuck with Starbucks? \n I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things.

Mainly due to that I've learned to trust Asus mobos, it's got 2x Intel X710-AT2, ECC, IPMI, M.2 and is actually available. I'm likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I'm a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)\n - How's the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I'm aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I'll succeed with a 2U though.\n - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?\n - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense?

          "description": "So I've mounted my homelab and it is working great! \n The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I'm looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.\n I've got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they're lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?\n    submitted by    /u/MadTiago  \n [link]   [comments]",

I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?\n I've got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg\n Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better.

I had like 600 tabs open on my Chrome on my android phone. 2+ years of \"oh, this looks interesting/useful. I'll look at this later..\"\n Some of it was probably just crap, but I had lots of important stuff open too. Stupid I know, should have used bookmarks and sync to backup or something. It was on my to-do list to get the backup sorted, but I didn't get around to it. Procrastination. I accidentally clicked \"clear all data\" and it's all gone. I've felt shitty all weekend, not even joking. How pathetic is that, I know. Can't stop thinking about the stuff I've lost (or more specifically, the stuff I don't know that I lost, which is 10x worse). Nobody else understands.. Know it sounds melodramatic and ridiculous but that's how I feel. Think this is probably one of the only places on the internet who understands the feeling, everyone I've mentioned it to is just like \"so what?\"\n    submitted by    /u/Peniche1997  \n [link]   [comments]",

I'm worried that if I pay for V10, they will update to V11 very quickly, then I have to pay again. \n For cloud backup, I currently don't have any. I do have a Nextcloud server set up and is using the Nextcloud software to sync certain folders/files.\n I'm trying to see if there are better alternatives, free or paid. If free, I need versioning as my critical files are changing everyday and I schedule daily backups for those files & folders. If paid, is there a better licensing method compared to Syncback?\n My requirements are as follows:\n 1) Local backups and Nextcloud server backups\n 2) Able to choose which folders/files to backup for Nextcloud separately from local backups\n 3) Versioning\n 4) Incremental Backup\n 5) Scheduling\n 6) File integrity check\n 7) Need to be able to restore individual files\n 8) I'm not sure if I need image backups as sometimes I like to wipe my computer clean and reinstall only the software that I really need at that time.

ZFS sounds interesting and I really want to learn it, but I don’t know if ZFS is recommendable for my small setup, plus, my RAM is 12GB and non-ECC . I’ve also read about some filesystems that would cause problems if you run out of space, I want to avoid them.\n The ability to access the FS on Windows is good, but not completely necessary. WinBTRFS doesn’t seem to be 100% reliable to not corrupt the data on Windows… but not sure.\n So what filesystem do you recommend to me? What encryption scheme is recommended? I’ve heard that some filesystems have builtin encryption. I assume, first I have to create an encrypted filesystem on the two other HDDs and copy the files to them.

Prices more than doubled in April this year and are going up again now to 34p/kWh. Business rates are as high as 93p/kWh.\n I'm currently running a 12 bay Supermicro server with 128 GB RAM and dual Xeon E5-2650 v2. It uses approx 4.2 kWh per day so running costs have gone up from £17/month to £44/month and are set to rise more soon.\n I'd like to move to a more power efficient option to save money. I don't desperately need the dual Xeons, all I need is the following\n  \n10-12 bays\n enough processing/GPU to be able to run Plex for 1-2 people\n 2 ethernet ports\n quiet enough in a cupboard\n nice to have at least one ethernet port 10 GbE\n  \nIf I can spend a few hundred quid on lower-power hardware, I'll make my money back in a couple of years.\n What are my options? I'm up for any ideas about more efficient hardware than can still hold a decent number of drives.

As per the title, I was planning to build a small but mighty NAS (mini-ITX) which is also going to he used as a web server, and one of the \"requirements\" are that jt should ideally consume as less power as possible since it's going to stay on 24/7.\n Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:\n  \nTDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T\n frequencies, including the base frequency\n  \nSo, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it's the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.\n So yea I understand that the T under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.\n My concern is the following.\n When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? \n The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.\n Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something?\n I'm asking here as there's plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.\n Any advice or insights is very much appreciated.\n Thanks a lot! 😊\n    submitted by    /u/matteventu  \n [link]   [comments]",

I would like to switch to something more stable where it doesn't feel like I'm just freeloading off of an accounting oversight.\n Given the similar nature of most hoards (ripped blu-rays, youtube archives, linux ISOs, etc), it seems like there should be a way to share backup of a given collection with others, deduplicating and splitting the cost in the process.

Best example: we had a scanner classroom with a dozen different scanners for digitalizing film photography and such. People often didn't delete the stuff from the computers after they were done and I collected them. \n Now I want to start an art project with all these collected files, but I'm not sure if this is allowed. I know from some of them who it was, but most of the time people didn't really add names to their files. I probably can ask the ones that did add their name for permission. But is that even necessary?\n It was stored on public computers, there were no rules about the usage of it all. \n I also recall artist Sherrie Levine who blatantly copied work of great artists such as Evan Walker, Edgar Degas and Marcel Duchamp. Without asking their permission of course. \n This might be the wrong sub to ask this, but someone might be able to help me out here.\n    submitted by    /u/Krullenbos  \n [link]   [comments]",

I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.\n Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this?

Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$.

          "description": "Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.\n I'm currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don't enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).\n From what I can decipher reading the interview:\n  \nThey're intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical's traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).\n Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned \"somewhere between\" Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there's currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.\n The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I'll leave it at that.\n  \nWhat I didn't see in the coverage (if I'm not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we're talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc's inorganic pitting \"secret sauce\" or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?\n I'd be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:\n  \nHow optimistic you are about this project?\n Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we're talking WORM) backup.\n  \n   submitted by    /u/danielrosehill  \n [link]   [comments]",

If you're familiar with his content, he's been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he's a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it's a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won't be around for long, since he's been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you've ever watched any of his content, you'd know he's extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I'm thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I'm looking at? Thank you.\n    submitted by    /u/TCIE  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I'm thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.\n I've come across some comments like \"NAS isn't intended to be turned on/off\" or vague comments such as \"they aren't rated for that\" but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don't see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.\n Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.\n    submitted by    /u/seeminglyugly  \n [link]   [comments]",

          "description": "Hi,\n I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.\n ​\n It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p\n I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.\n I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...\n But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. \n I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. \n Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?\n    submitted by    /u/Spam00r  \n [link]   [comments]",

Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into \" nsfw\" territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?\n We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.\n Thanks in advance!\n    submitted by    /u/Chaostheory0101  \n [link]   [comments]",

Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. \n I've found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. \n I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I'm working on periodically. \n I've had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them.

          "description": "I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was \"stored\" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)\n I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?\n Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.\n I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical\n (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)\n    submitted by    /u/Ok_Tomatillo5104  \n [link]   [comments]",
