                              <span>Anybody have recommendations on what I should look for in terms of a pair of 10Gbe NIC&#x27;s? I wanna accelerate file transfer between my &#x27;server&#x27; (Mish mash of consumer HW running windows server) and my desktop. Would prefer RJ45 but if it&#x27;s cheaper to go SFP+ and it&#x27;s associated cables I&#x27;d be ok with that.
 Just needs support for Win10 and Server 19.

 Would the R2xx (probably R200, R210 or R220) be a good candidate for the job?
 And which DVR OS/software do you guys use or recommend??

                              <span>I don;t know if this is the place that is most appropriate to ask this in, but here we go anyway: 
 So I have a &quot;router&quot; that happens to be running pfSense with an i7 12700k CPU. I&#x27;m kind of curious, if I were to get DDOSed, would it still have the same impact as on a regular router, or would it be harder take it out of service because of the more powerful CPU?

                              <span>Hope this is ok to post, but I could use some help. 
 My home is 3 stories, and I want to set up a solid wireless network that is as hidden as possible (read: high WAF). I’ve got an Amplifi HD, but I’m not thrilled with the coverage and speed. 
 I see locations where I can run Ethernet to all three floors, and would ideally like to use PoE AP’s so that I can hide AP’s in closets without running power, but am open to non PoE options. 
 I imagine that ceiling mount throws coverage mostly down for one room, so would that not work with one AP per floor?
 I’m also seeing that some consumer mesh networks automatically adjust coverage to prevent crosstalk and am not sure if more enterprise / prosumer solutions rely on the installer to map coverage to prevent crosstalk?
 Finally, while I do have a technical background, I prefer not to tinker with tech at home (fully realize I may be asking in the wrong subreddit here, but am hoping you all may know of solutions).
 Any help and advice greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hey guys!
 Before I start - I just want to say I didn&#x27;t setup my homelab in the hopes of ever making money of it. I just recently thought it would be cool to repurpose some of my idle hardware to host some services for people, as a hobby / sidegig.
 ​
 Anyways, as the title suggests, do any of you generate revenue from your homelab? and if so, how? I wouldn&#x27;t consider my current setup highend, and the majority of it consists of 12th gen dell and 8th gen HP servers. (Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&amp;T&#x27;s stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I&#x27;m (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. 
 I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren&#x27;t officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good idea, or if there&#x27;s better solutions for a side gig.

                              <span>I have a WD drive that was shucked some years ago with kapton tape put over the pin so it could be used inside a PC. I don&#x27;t want it as an internal drive anymore and am wondering if it can be put in a different generic enclosure and used as an external drive? Would it work if I removed the tape?

                              <span>So I have a Elements 4TB drive that I use to store various files like videos and game roms and it’s been acting weird recently. The transfer speeds fluctuate and sometimes stops the transfer altogether until it resumes. Now, it sometimes does a clicking noise, it doesn’t do it all the time but it’s a slight click. Windows and CrystalDiskInfo claims there is no problems with the drive and it’s all healthy but I think otherwise and I can still access the drive. What should I do?

                              <span>im trying to do a setup to protect against data corruption for some long-term storage. i don&#x27;t plan to just let the data sit for months or years without copying/accessing it to keep it active, but in the event, i just want to do the best i can to ensure that the integrity is intact. i have a 3-2-1 setup but this is for one of those backups that will be accessed the least.
 anyway, i like putting stuff in archives. dealing with tons of files its been helpful to keep stuff tidy and organized. i see that i can do recovery volumes in winrar when building my archives which from what i can gather work like par files. i wondered from anybody who has experience with this stuff if it is better to stick to a program like multipar or if this winrar feature is legit and these .rev files could help rebuild an archive in the event of corruption?
 thanks for any help on the subject

 I can&#x27;t get a copy of HPE Openstore software since I am not the original owner of the drive and the license is expired on this old drive.
 I just want to drag and drop files from HDDs to tape but cant get the LTO to show up in file explorer.
 I installed Veeam but this appears to be backup software that works on repeating schedules. I just want to drag and drop whenever. 
 What software do you recommend?

                              <span>I just set up my first home server running Debian Bullseye.
 I&#x27;d like the server to hold my movies and music, but I care much more about music functionality than bells and whistles on movies and videos.
 Most important to me would be that whatever setup I go with, it acknowledges my star ratings and date that I last played it. I also want to be able to give new star ratings when I get more music.
 The last time I had a good self-hosted music setup was when my ipod classic still worked. I occasionally synced my ipod with itunes on a Windows machine via USB.
 I tried out Jellyfin, but their android app for playing music is too buggy, and there&#x27;s no way to assign star ratings or make smart playlists.
 I&#x27;m thinking of giving Kodi a shot, and hope that maybe there&#x27;s a plug-in or something that will let me give star ratings and keep track of play counts and date last played, the way itunes used to.
 Background:
 The server is running Debian, and the Kodi docs warn of extra complications with Kodi and Debian. I&#x27;m not sure if I should worry about that or if it won&#x27;t matter because the clients aren&#x27;t on Debian.
 The clients will either be Android-based devices, or some flavor of Ubuntu.
 Questions:
  
Should I go with a different back end for the server, or use the one built into Kodi?
 Should I forget about Kodi and look at some other client/server combination?
  
I will be adding movies, photos, and home videos to the server, but satisfying my music library needs is most important.
 There are so many options and combinations that I&#x27;m just hoping to get some general direction.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am slowly getting into self hosting. I have made a TrueNAS SCALE machine that, so far, just serves as a media server. I use, and have used, Plex heavily for years, movies and shows only.
 I am getting into organizing and serving other media I use less frequently:
  
Photos, Images
 Audiobooks
 Podcasts
 Comic books
  
I&#x27;m ready to tackle the next content on my list: photos &amp; images. I frequently see two self-hosted solutions recommended here: Photoprism and Plex photos to a lesser extent. 
 I recall a couple years ago Plex ended the phone auto-upload capability, which fed into its Photo libraries. However, I see nextcloud+plex recommended as a means to sync photos from phones to plex. I like plex&#x27;s built-in abilities to serve content outside of my local network. On the other hand, should I be concerned that plex will pull the plug on the photos feature completely?
 Photoprism seems to have some extra capabilities such as feature/face recognition. The UI is unfamiliar at the moment though.
 I definitely want to use something with a native docker build in the truenas scale &quot;app&quot; libraries to keep things simple. I think I would like to, at a minimum, separate my libraries into photos and images (for things like digital art).
 Which approach would be best for a self hosting beginner with the above needs? Anything obvious I&#x27;m not considering? How big a deal is putting another &quot;egg in the basket&quot; by relying on Plex to handle another media type vs. diversifying into other applications?

 I&#x27;m new to this. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using the right terminology or not.
 I&#x27;m looking for a self-hosted Program/Server to link up a few Windows PCs to an Active Directory-type server to sync up all the user&#x27;s so that we would only have to create a user account on the server, and the user can log in with their credentials on any of the office PCs.
 I don&#x27;t mind self-hosting on-site or remotely.

 Can anyone recommend a self-host alternative to Cpanel/WHM setup that I can just directly administer that is #1 Open source and #2 FREE for reseller hosting services ( again I mostly host stuff for myself and a few non-profits like library board or community health 5k run event... we get spikes in traffic then nothing then spikes again with events...

                              <span>Hi all,
 I stumbled across grocy in this sub when looking for a solution to build a shared shopping list. While complete ERP seems overkill to me, I like the idea of automating the list. So it is installed and 60+ products in the database. 😂 However one aspect still bothers me: How do you manage one time items? E.g. a shop having a limited offer for clothing or tech? It would increase the wife acceptance factor by a lot if these items could also easiliy put on the shopping list.
 Cheers!

 While it isn&#x27;t entirely self-hosted I thought it might be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I need to create a folder with a specific structure of subfolders and files, and share it with people using a link. They should be able to open this link on their browser and view/download only whatever is shared with them using the link.
 I was using Onedrive for this. A python script used to copy the files into the onedrive subfolder, and I had enabled share on the folder and sent the link. That was when I was using my windows PC.
 I&#x27;ve since transitioned to a VM on Digital Ocean, and to use the Onedrive APIs I need to pay for a subscription and start an Azure account which I really don&#x27;t want to do.
 Is there any free or self hosted option to achieve this?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I want to replace my 10 year old Qnap TS-212p NAS. In the past, I used to have the webGUI exposed to the internet, but because a lot of vulnerabilities were discovered, I disabled this.
 A couple of friends used the webGUI to save photo&#x27;s to my NAS and I also used it a lot for link file sharing. This was my preferred way to share files over 30MB+. I can also use different internet services, but this is r/selfhosted :D
 I preferably don&#x27;t want to expose the webGUI anymore, but I do want to share files via this NAS. I think a Synology would be the best option when I want to do this. Is there a something I&#x27;m missing as a potential option to share (and upload) files securely from the internet?
 //edit: Side-note. I&#x27;m not going to expose my home IP anymore. I have a site-to-site VPN running to a virtualized environment in a datacenter. When I&#x27;m going to expose it, I will use a reverse proxy in my datacenter environment, to access the webGUI of the NAS at my home network.

                              <span>Not sure exactly what to call this. I have a personal website hosted on apache open to the internet. I have several webcams (5-10 depending on motivation) inside of my network that I want to keep isolated within my network. The cams have both a snapshot URL, as well as a streaming URL, and I am centrally monitoring them internally with a MotionEye docker.
 I want to create a &#x27;gallery&#x27; on my apache server that acts as a proxy for those URLs, and pipes the data to the web server. I don&#x27;t want to expose the backend cams or docker at all.
 At one point I had a system set up that used ProxyPass, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything like that anymore.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I thought I was getting the hang of it, but guess I was wrong so I need some help :)
 I have a nice media server setup at home with all the *arr apps, and a couple of other apps, all running with Docker. I would like to access one (or potentially more) of my services over VPN, by using a subdomain of my main domain, which in this case is domain.xyz.
 Let&#x27;s say I want to access my Overseerr instance from the internet. My goal is to go to overseerr.lan.domain.xyz and be redirected to my docker container which is actually 10.0.0.51:9443.
 With that comes a few questions:
  
I need to setup the A record for my sub domain, but what IP address do I use for it? Do I need a DDNS service that will give me a domain to my router&#x27;s (also the DNS at my home) IP?
 
Maybe related to the first question, do I need a local DNS server in my home?
 
What do I setup in NPM after creating the sub domain?
 
Where do SSL certs come into this and how do I utilize them in this setup?
 
 Thank you :)
 Edit:
 Forgot to mention VPN. I saw most people recommend WireGaurd and Tailscale, so I&#x27;ll just check that out as well.

                              <span>So I recently shipped a tool for stupid easy self-hosting , but it&#x27;s focused on the cloud, not on personal hardware. So I ran a poll in our community to see what people actually use to self-host.
 Here are the results:
 - In total, 810 votes were cast (about 0.4% of r/selfhosted members)
 - The most popular option is &quot;From a dedicated server/self-hosting machine at home&quot; - 616 votes 
 - Next up is &quot;With a big cloud provider (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc&quot; - 79 votes (about 10%)
 - &quot;From my own personal device (PC, laptop, Mac, etc)&quot; - 62 votes
 - &quot;With a small local/community cloud&quot; - 21 votes
 The rest had other options in mind (check out comments under the original poll)
 Takeaway: I might need to add the option to self-host on your own hardware to my product. Will work on that then. There&#x27;s already some indication of what hardware people use (Raspberry Pis, old laptops, Unraid and custom servers..), but a more detailed review calls for another poll.

                              <span>With the acquisition of iRobot to Amazon I&#x27;m seriously considering selling my J7+, which I quite like, and instead purchasing a robot with the intention of flashing it with Valetudo and running it locally. I&#x27;m considering the Dreame Z10 Pro since it&#x27;s on sale for $480 right now, but if there was a better one for me to get I&#x27;d be more than happy to hear it.
 It has to have a self-cleaning base and be fairly good at avoiding obstacles. My place is 90% laminate wood floors and a couple rugs (with a rug pad underneath). Mopping really isn&#x27;t critical.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for self hosted markdown (web-)editor to replace OneNote as a notetaking application.
 I do not need any fancy features like being able to draw or anything, but standard markdown features like being able to insert pictures and create tables would be nice. It should also be able to read/organize content hierarchically based on the folder structure the files are placed in. The editor should simple and easy to use so that my wife also can use it for here notetaking.
 The most important thing is that the I am able to open the notes in any other markdown editor and that I can later replace the editor and just point to the same folder(s). I.e. I need an editor that works on actual markdown files rather than storing the content of the files in a database.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m here because I have a small problem and can&#x27;t find a solution googling online.
 I have a server in my LAN, it&#x27;s configured with Ubuntu Server 20.04 and Docker, and everything runs on Docker.
 I have Traefik V2.8 as a reverse proxy.
 At the moment, my domain is linked with my house ip address, but I wanted to change that to be more relaxed in letting my friends use services like Nextcloud and Searxng or pihole around the world, so I bought a VPS (the $1 one from IONOS, with 1VCore and 512MB RAM) with the idea of creating a VPN connection and routing the HTTPS traffic to my LAN.
 Problem is, it&#x27;s not working and I don&#x27;t know why.
 If I put Traefik in network_mode: service behind the Wireguard container, I can ping the VPS Wireguard container from it, but I don&#x27;t know how to route the traffic from the VPS to Traefik and make Traefik accept it.
 I tried with NGINX on the VPS, but the proxy_pass isn&#x27;t working.
 I configured it like that:
 server { listen 80; listen 443; location / { proxy_pass http://10.13.13.2; } } 
 10.13.13.2 is the IP of the Wireguard container on my home server. 
 Also, I have to implement the same thing for a friend who can&#x27;t open ports on their modem (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not using other stuff like the docker overlay network). 
 Another configuration could be running Traefik on the VPS, and reverse-proxying to containers through VPN to solve the problem of having to proxy stuff through NGINX to Traefik, but in this case I have absolutely no idea how to connect Traefik on the VPS to the docker network at home... 
 Thank you in advance for the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking on setting up a household groupware site, calendars, contacts, and apps. I don&#x27;t need or care about file sharinig. All the nextcloud alternatives I find seem to focus on the file sharing aspect of alternatives, so I&#x27;m curious if there are any other decent apps that could replace it.
 I tried homechart, but the requirement on a 3rd party account for a locally hosted server, along with the massively large ads asking me to subscribe, quickly made it a no-go.

                              <span>Hello,
 Could you please advice me on what are the specs that are needed to create a home media server ? I already have a NAS 720+ with arr apps and jellyfin but I am not satisfied with its transcodification capabilities (I&#x27;ve been struggling to read medias on my android TV).
 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i&#x27;m looking for something that is standalone (basically I don&#x27;t want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I&#x27;m looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can&#x27;t use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an Oracle instance running a couple of apps, with nginx Proxy Manager, proxied through Cloudflare, with Auth0 handling the auth. It all works fine, except for the firewall rules in Oracle. I have all of the Cloudflare IPs and Auth0 allowed on the firewall, but I can&#x27;t get beyond authentication unless I have a 0.0.0.0/0 rule in the firewall.
 Does anyone have tips on how to pinpoint the issue? It&#x27;s my first time dealing with this combo of services, and I thought I had everything done correctly, but obviously not!
 Thanks.

                              <span>I purchased a used CD duplicating tower with 8 disc drives with the hopes of turning it into a large-scale CD ripper (EAC, mainly). 
 The main hang-up is mounting a motherboard into the case. There is no back part of the case to mount anything. There isn&#x27;t even a back panel as the top and both sides are one continuous piece.
 I can&#x27;t find anything about this subject online (including the search term &quot;CD duplicator&quot; only shows &quot;How to Copy onto a CD&quot; results) and I didn&#x27;t see anything in the DH wiki. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of project?

                              <span>First off I am looking to get a drive for storing my Youtube videos as a backup in case I ever need my original or edited videos. Once the drive is filled I don&#x27;t see myself using the drive unless I needed to for some reason or another. So my 2 questions are.
  
Would a HDD or a SDD be better for me with. Will there be any data loss if im not using them for long period of time after filling it up as I only need it as a back up storage.
 When I look at HDD I see the External drives like the Western Digital Easystore or Mybook. What would be the difference in one of those type of externals and just getting a hard drive and putting it into an enclosure?

 I have small server running raid 10 (4-6tb drives) . the other day I lost everything in a particular drive until i used the windows error checking tool and it all showed back up.
 well now the whole thing says i need to format the drive, which is the whole raid server.
 individually when i take the drives out they all show up except for drive 1 which says it needs to format.
 ​
 is it just a bad drive? ive had bad drives before and they of course repopulate when a new one is inserted, will this work?

                              <span>One of the disk in my 5 year old 6x raidz2 array died and I bought a replacement for it, I went with a WD Red 6TB just because it is the same model as the other disks, I was not aware of the differences in SMR vs CMR, and of course it was not mentioned in the listing. Last night I added the new disk and let it resilver overnight, but it did bother me that in smartctl it has (SMR) in the name.
 So today after searching about it I found all this info about how bad the SMR disks are for raid and especially bad for raidz, this one article says it took them 9 days to resilver a 4TB Red, and i&#x27;m here confused because it only took 8hrs for my raidz2 (56% full) zpool, so I have to ask if they are that bad? should I avoid them if possible in the future?

                              <span>Since I know a decent amount of you probably use more than 6 sata ports, and have every single HDD slot filled (including the 5 1/4), I&#x27;ve been looking at the new AM5 platform and based on seeing what was removed, made me wonder if any of you would upgrade to it.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that with AM5, that if you want 8x sata ports, you need to buy 670e. However most of those only come with 2 x16 PCI 5 slots. Since I know some of you use some sort of Sata controller (probably either in a x1 or the x16 (4x) slot), how many would still upgrade, if you had to use the controller in the 2nd x16 slot (thus both now run at 8/8).

                              <span>So I was looking at getting a new HDD for my home server, and was looking at an 8tb drive but then saw that the Toshiba MG09 18TB (MG09ACA18TE) was available for a little more so I was thinking with that little of a price difference then I’ll take the 18TB drive, but my server (An old Dell Optiplex 7010 DT) can’t simply find it, maybe 1 out of 100 tries I can see it in my bios, so I went to a friend of mine and his machine just saw it, we had some issues formatting but the bios could always see it and we got it formatted…
 But my pc would simply not see it…
 Can it be some kind of issues with the drive (3.3V) or is it just my old machine which is causing the issues?

                              <span>The Overwatch forums are being replaced and when this happened in the past back in 2016 or 2017 they didn&#x27;t save everything. I downloaded httrack and have it running.
 Address is https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/
 I just ran into 429 so looking into how to get around that now.
 Is someone who is more experienced with backing up a site was able to give it a go as well?
 EDIT: Seems like the wayback machine has some of the forums backed up but ever post I tried to view was missing.

                              <span>I have a lot of smaller hard drives that take up all of the drive bays in my PC. I&#x27;m looking to get rid of them and just buy two 14+ tb hdds and move everything to them.
 I was looking up the Seagate Exos X16 14TB but many people commented its quite loud and they wouldn&#x27;t put it in their main PC. Sadly, that&#x27;s exactly what I want to do. 😅
 Are there any 14+ tb hdds that are also quiet but 7200prm? Hell, I may just go big and get 3. Preferably close to that ~$14/tb range.

                              <span>So I know I&#x27;m going to get ripped apart for this but here goes. Among other forms of data hoarding, I&#x27;m also a tab hoarder. I had like 600 tabs open on my Chrome on my android phone. 2+ years of &quot;oh, this looks interesting/useful. I&#x27;ll look at this later..&quot;
 Some of it was probably just crap, but I had lots of important stuff open too. Stupid I know, should have used bookmarks and sync to backup or something. It was on my to-do list to get the backup sorted, but I didn&#x27;t get around to it. Procrastination. I accidentally clicked &quot;clear all data&quot; and it&#x27;s all gone. I&#x27;ve felt shitty all weekend, not even joking. How pathetic is that, I know. Can&#x27;t stop thinking about the stuff I&#x27;ve lost (or more specifically, the stuff I don&#x27;t know that I lost, which is 10x worse). Nobody else understands.. Know it sounds melodramatic and ridiculous but that&#x27;s how I feel. Think this is probably one of the only places on the internet who understands the feeling, everyone I&#x27;ve mentioned it to is just like &quot;so what?&quot;

                              <span>I know this is a long shot but is there any way to recover a lost post that isn’t on waybackmachine/archive.org or google cache, that would be helped by the fact that it disappeared sometime in the last week and was last accessed on my computer only last week? (I found some reference to the idea of an individual computer’s cache somewhere but couldn’t find any more info on that).

                              <span>There&#x27;s a weekly show of something which I would like to share to another device in another house and I wanted some advice on the easiest way to do this for someone who might struggle with tech. (Edit: I would like to do it remotely)
 Whilst the ideal would be some way of sharing it to his tv, I know this is impossible without another device which adds a whole new UI problem. That leaves me with pc to pc, which I&#x27;m thinking something like google drive might be the simplest, but even that will be a learning curve.

 Any tips on what the cheapest is? (nno redunndancy required as it is just an offsite backup.).
 Any tips for dealing with uploading that much data quickly?

                              <span>Has anyone self hosted here before? I ask in here as my site stevenwhiting.com was supposed to be a place for myself for my notes. As an IT engineer I just wanted a place on the web that I could see my notes wherever I was. Unfortunately, after 12 years of keeping it up, I can&#x27;t afford it anymore. It will cost £95.99 again this year, I can&#x27;t fault Krystal Hosting as their customer support has always been really good. I just can&#x27;t justify paying that this year.
 I&#x27;m going to speak to them to see if I can possibly get a cheaper package but I was thinking of just hosting it myself on and off. So it won&#x27;t be on all the time. I have a spare Raspberry Pi that I could stick it on. Just don&#x27;t know how easy it is to host your own wordpress site.

                              <span>I have always wondered if the closer you are to filling an HDD if it affects overall performance? I know if it is full it will start acting weird but is there a specific percentage? Like if you have an 8TB HDD you should have at least 500GB in reserve or something available to keep up performance? I hope this makes sense.

                              <span>I come to this sub occasionally to see what cool projects people are working on and to enjoy the blinking lights of server towers. I&#x27;d love to have a piece of kit like this in my basement but I don&#x27;t really have a need for massive computing power or networking. Just wifi and an amazon dongle here. 
 What is your use or need for a server at home?
 ​
 p.s. I guess I can use one to store hard drives for YouTube footage backup? But then again I use an old LTO5 drive for that.

 Looking to build a DIY nas to replace aging QNAP.
 Will be used as file server and backup. However, I also want to be able to spin up docker containers for OS, CI/CD self hosted agents, VS Code server etc.
 I’m a little confused and unsure if possible/how I can have TrueNAS setup for file serving, and have these home lab virtualisation flexibility, how I might split the storage pool to accommodate files and VMs, whether, with TrueNAS as OS I will still have access to the CLI to do docker builds etc?
 I feel I’m missing some basic understanding on how such requirements might be set up on a home lab.
 Grateful for any clarity!

                              <span>As the title says, im about to get into this rabbit hole...
 A bit of background -- Like 20 years ago i was an Integration Engineer for a Telco vendor and specialized in management systems. I was quite fluent on HP UX and whatever applications we used to use back in the day. Life happened and I went to the Dark Side and became a manager
 Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I&#x27;m kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)
 I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal
 I don&#x27;t have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus
 Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant
 Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started. Does this sounds reasonable?
 Any other help of pointers you guys can give me are much appreciated

 Finally, with a functioning infrastructure and critical issues resolved we are ready to reboot the World Community Grid!
 Your ongoing support and feedback during the transition from IBM has been invaluable to the scientists who rely on us. Together we improved the Grid’s functionality and efficiency by targeting our limited technical resources, and while we certainly encountered more obstacles and challenges than we anticipated we are here now because of your patience and persistence.
 There is work that remains to be done. In particular, while we were able to restore the My Contribution page functionality and you may have noticed that results over the past 2…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve long been using these mini PCs as my home router. The current gen on Amazon for reference ..
 https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-ZBOX-N3160-DDR3L-1600-SATAIII/dp/B01N95X5KH/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?keywords&#x3D;zotac%2Bmini%2Bpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1664674168&amp;qu&#x3D;eyJxc2MiOiI1LjEyIiwicXNhIjoiNS4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjMuMzQifQ%3D%3D&amp;s&#x3D;electronics&amp;sprefix&#x3D;zotac%2Bmini%2Celectronics%2C158&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;ufe&#x3D;app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&amp;th&#x3D;1
 I just install linux on one of these, configure routing / firewall / dhcp / etc. It hits the sweet spot for me, small, silent, dual ethernet ports. I don&#x27;t care about the wifi and keep it disabled.
 Now I have occasion to run IEEE 1588 / PTP on my network. I&#x27;d like to host the grandmaster clock on my router. However, the box I have (slightly older version of the link above) does not support hardware timestamping on the ethernet NIC.
 ​
 0 % ethtool -T enp2s0 # the other interface shows the same capabilities Time stamping parameters for enp2s0: Capabilities: software-transmit software-receive software-system-clock PTP Hardware Clock: none Hardware Transmit Timestamp Modes: none Hardware Receive Filter Modes: none 
 ​
 I&#x27;m looking at new hardware, and I&#x27;d like to get something very similar to what I already have, but with a newer ethernet chipset / support for 1588 HW timestamping. I&#x27;ve had a really difficult time determining, for the candidate hardware, whether the onboard NIC will have this capability.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hey people.
 I&#x27;m looking to build a more proper rack based homelab for VM&#x27;s, NAS and networking but my office is upstairs and basically full and my NBN node is actually in my garage so it seems my only option is to set the rack up in my garage.
 Is there anyone here from Australia and more specifically in a more humid climate like QLD who has their lab in their garage? and if so is there anything extra that should be done? My garage is extremely clean and only other purpose is for my gym setup and a freezer so it should be a nice environment for it.

                              <span>Hi, I have an almost unused
  
HP Z220 Intel Xeon E-1240 V2 CMT
 32GB RAM
 256GB SSD for OS
 6TB x 3 for NAS
 4TB x 2 for backups.
  
Is this good for a Homelab virtual server + NAS.
 I am not into gaming or video editing. I will probably run Emby or Plex for media and will run 2 - 3 Windows VMs for family members and two Linux VMs as my dev server.
 I am planning to install Proxmox on it. It will be running a couple of VMs ( windows 10 pro + Linux Mint) and a TrueNAS instance severing as NAS. I am wondering if this config will be able to handle this workload.
 I am pretty new to all this. So bear with me if I have a few things backwards.

                              <span>Hello,
 Could you please advice me on what are the specs that are needed to create a home media server ? I already have a NAS 720+ with arr apps and jellyfin but I am not satisfied with its transcodification capabilities (I&#x27;ve been struggling to read medias on my android TV).
 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i&#x27;m looking for something that is standalone (basically I don&#x27;t want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I&#x27;m looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can&#x27;t use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

                              <span>Just installed Deskpool and the entire thing is very very sketchy. First of all, all of the posts I can find about it are from the creator of it, and everything is in Chinese. The user interface seems very outdated(think ESXI but 10x worse and slower). And instead of asking for an API Key for hypervisor integration, it asks for the ROOT password.
 ​
 Also even though they accept commercial payments, they don&#x27;t have any copyright (at least that I can find) or a entry in the Better Business Bureau database. There website https://www.deskpool.com/ is also sketchy (at least it feels like it with everything else) with basically 0 documentation to speak of. 
 Has anyone actually deployed this before? If so has anything been weird?

                              <span>I’m just wondering what domains/URLs you are all using for self-hosted services. Are you using subdomains? Do you have a domain with your personal name as main domain, or do you have a special domain for your services?
 I have a mylastname.tld domain and am planning to host multiple services via docker (publicly but only for personal use) and make them available via subdomains via Caddy reverse proxy. I am pondering whether to use my aforementioned domain like for example git.mylastname.tld or to use other formats like git.home.mylastname.tld or another main domain (instead of mylastname) altogether.
 This is not about the technical realisations, these are clear to me, just curiosity about how others organise and use their domains or if there is something like a best practice.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to do something similar to this, but using nomad.
 If I understand correctly the nomad documentation I have to setup a CNI network for this. This is my config right now:
 json { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;mynet&quot;, &quot;cniVersion&quot;: &quot;0.4.0&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;bridge&quot;, &quot;isDefaultGateway&quot;: true, &quot;ipMasq&quot;: true, &quot;ipam&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;host-local&quot;, &quot;ranges&quot;: [ [ { &quot;subnet&quot;: &quot;172.22.0.0/16&quot; } ] ] } } ] } 
 Nomad parses the config, gives no error message. So far so good. Now here is my job file for pihole:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hcl job &quot;pihole&quot; { datacenters &#x3D; [&quot;dc1&quot;]
 group &quot;pihole&quot; {
 network { mode &#x3D; &quot;cni/mynet&quot; port &quot;http&quot; { static &#x3D; 80 to &#x3D; 80 } port &quot;DNS&quot; { static &#x3D; 53 to &#x3D; 53 } } task &quot;pihole&quot; { driver &#x3D; &quot;docker&quot; env { TZ &#x3D; &quot;Europe/Budapest&quot; VIRTUAL_HOST &#x3D; &quot;pi.hole&quot; PROXY_LOCATION &#x3D; &quot;pi.hole&quot; FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 &#x3D; &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; WEBPASSWORD &#x3D; &quot;piholepass&quot; } config { image &#x3D; &quot;pihole/pihole:latest&quot; ports &#x3D; [&quot;http&quot;, &quot;DNS&quot;] ipv4_address &#x3D; &quot;172.22.0.2&quot; volumes &#x3D; [ &quot;/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole&quot;, &quot;/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d&quot;, ] } } 
 } }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If I use network.mode &#x3D; &quot;bridge&quot; and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine. However this version starts up normally, but it can not reach the internet:
  [✗] DNS resolution is currently unavailable 
 I have checked that CNI takes care of routing, the proper nat tables show up with ifconfig.
 Any idea how should I fix this? Anything else to check?

                              <span>I have an old gaming rig, some new hard drives, a list of things I&#x27;d like a personal home server for, and a few steps missing in terms of actually getting everything up and running.
 First is the OS, I&#x27;m thinking Debian since I&#x27;m more familiar with Debian based stuff than others, but if there&#x27;s better options I&#x27;m up to learn.
 The next stumbling bock is that I&#x27;m vaguely aware of containerization being good for things like the game servers and probably an Element instance I want to have but I have no idea where to even begin with that. Is it a &quot;definitely do this&quot;, &quot;good practice but not strictly necessary&quot;, or &quot;you&#x27;re probably not gonna need it&quot; sort of thing?
 The last is backups and storage. I&#x27;ve never actually done a proper network share before with Linux, but I&#x27;d like to. I&#x27;ve been using an external drive and Timeshift for backups, but it looks like it&#x27;s more geared towards non-network backups. Is that a problem that should sort itself out once I get a proper share set up or should I probably be using something else?
 Those are my questions. I welcome all help and suggestions you got for me.

                              <span>Hey! Just published a pretty big list of tools, categorized and organized into sections (Engineering, Marketing, Operations, and so on). Took quite a lot of time, and I incorporated tools from all sources I could find. 
 The stats are as follows:
 - 364 tools in total, out of these
 - 229 are open-source
 - 19 are fair-code (licenses that e.g. disallow commercial use, like Elastic license) 
 - 45 are proprietary with easy export options (mostly for reference)
 It&#x27;s also easy to submit new tools there if anything&#x27;s missing. Hope these serve as inspiration, there are also links to websites and I plan to add direct links to docs so you can jump to self-host any of those quickly. Hope you like it!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tidied up a project of mine enough to share. I give you, BeatLog! It&#x27;s available as a docker image and intended to be a local network companion to your server.
 ​
 Parse NGINX -- I use SWAG-- reverse proxy logs (access, error) and fail2ban logs, save the data into a PostgreSQL database, and generate neat reports, maps, and more. Note that adding locations to parsed IP addresses requires the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 BeatLog!
 Some features I&#x27;m proud of and use:
  
Rapidly parses log lines into useful data
 Characterize IP addresses as &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Outside&quot;, based on server&#x27;s current public IP address.
 Assess outside visitors by location, and other useful metrics
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren&#x27;t found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names
 Make fun maps
  
​
 Check it out if it appeals to you, and please submit any bugs you find or feedback you consider. As linked in the bullets above, I&#x27;ve tried to put some effort into the documentation to get a user started. Thanks!

                              <span>I need some help and have a lot of questions. I am unsure how to keep home network access fast, remote access secure and privacy for my traffic. 
 Currently running OMV + Linux based machine with docker (plex, arrs, vpn etc) but I want to move to a Proxmox host with VMs + containers. I acquired a Dell 730 for a killer price and will be moving to that in about 2 weeks. 
 I want to allow access to plex and something for plex requests to 3 users remotely. These 3 users will only ever access those two plex focused services. 
 I also want to expose about 10-15 services including the two plex ones above to 3 different users. Does this mean I need 2 different dashboards/sites for each user group?
 I thought maybe a reverse proxy (traefik) with authentication? (Authelia) put services behind wireguard to link to my VPN? Do I need something to handle certificates? Lets encrypt ? Cloud flare tunnels? So confused. 
 What&#x27;s the least complex way to do this and what order do I go in (maybe Traefik then wireguard then ???) Trying to figure out the boot/compose order so everything is ready before the next service starts up. Right 
 I have a domain name that I bought but how to use it Suggestions, links, guides anything to help put these pieces together is appreciated.

 In my quest to replace the seductive tools from GAFAMs in my (and my relatives) mobile/computer ecosystem with self-hosted ones, I want to replace whatsapp. After some research, matrix-synapse coupled with the element client, seems to be a good option.
 If any of you have succeeded in setting up something similar to what I&#x27;m trying to do, have tips, suggestions, leads or answers, then I&#x27;m interested :)
 Some personal constraints :
  
No domain name bought for the moment, I don&#x27;t want to depend on any external service, we&#x27;ll see if this choice will last in time (I also plan to host my DNS server)
 Hosting on a home server on a modest ADSL connection, the upload speed is therefore very low, but I intend to make with it at least for the whole test phase and then eventually mov…</span>

 Jellyfin, Sonarr, Bazarr, Radarr, qbittorrent, Adguard Home, Watchtower, Syncthing, Portainer
  
Only 2 things I use from Synology Package Manager is SMB Share and Tailscale for remote access.
 And I also require a Windows VM where I&#x27;ll need a USB passthrough which Trunas scale and core didnt offer, which made me switch to Xpenology.
  
Downside I ran into is Jellyfin Transcoding requires Nvidia driver to be 470 or above, Xpenology only offers 440.44 with no way to upgrade.
 So I&#x27;m looking for a Free OS or Hypervisor, that allows me to run every thing i have now in Docker containers and also offers me HW transcending in Jellyfin using Nvidia, plus allows me USB passthrough in VM and remote access with Tailscale.
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi all. 
 Hope this is the right spot to ask....
 So, today some weird things started happening on my network. All the apps that rely on &quot;outside access&quot; (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan  router (pppoe)  lan  nginx reverse proxy  apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns &quot;autobots&quot;.
 In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started &quot;falling off&quot; from my services. My phone wouldn&#x27;t sync with NextCloud, people&#x27;s locations didn&#x27;t update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if &quot;my&quot; domains were &quot;listed&quot; on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren&#x27;t propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).
 I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on? Anyone experiencing similar things?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some cheap cloud hosting for a discourse forum and a email server preferably under $15 a month would be perfect. I am going to use mail-in-a-box for the email server because of its lower system requirements. I used digital ocean previously but they increased their prices and AWS blocks SMTP ports. What are my options reddit?

                              <span>I currently run Nextcloudpi(not docker image) in Debian laptop with Photoview and Photoprism in Docker complementing the images and videos from Nextcloudpi. I also have motioneye for 3 of my cameras for continuous feed (not recording)
 ​
 Now planning to move the setup to a new machine with i5-9300U and Nvidia 1660Ti (6GB) machine with 16GB(can upgrade to 32GB as well) ram. I want to run the services that can also take advantage of the graphic card. So here are my questions
  
Is windows going to be better in terms of docker/services taking advantage of graphics? (I know docker in windows is VM whereas docker in linux run natively)
 I do see instructions to make docker use Nvidia graphics using NVIDIA container toolkit. Do they also apply to docker desktop? 
 Asking the above questions because it seems to be easy to manage docker containers through docker desktop app instead of old method
 
 Please suggest the services for photo/videos &amp; surveillance that can use my hardware optimally (both CPU and GPU) to render the content. 
 So far I have only seen Jellyfin that I can make it use the graphic card for video rendering and it worked great.
 
 Also suggest if there is any service other than Nextcloud(pi) that is better and can complement Jellyfin/Photoprism 
 Seafile is not for me because of it&#x27;s block based storage which makes it hard to backup my data to a cloud
 
  
Thanks for any inputs and suggestions

 With self-hosted services, is it unethical to replace the branding and designs with your own?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am running a single Proxmox server with a few LXCs and VMs. 
 On this, I have a single Ubuntu VM that acts as my main virtualized server for all my docker services. I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. 
 The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.
 This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I&#x27;d like to play with kubernetes a bit. I&#x27;ve already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.
 However, I still don&#x27;t understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I&#x27;d assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.
 If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.
 Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server? Is the increased complexity worth it anyhow?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have it on Cloudflare.
 Buy something like blah404.xyz, it&#x27;s about $40 for 10 years.
 Then, setup subdomains/zones like: *.machine_name.wan.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.local0.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.vpn0.blah404.xyz, etc.
 And, of course, these can all be compatible with Caddy and other pieces of software for automated SSL certificate management from LetsEncrypt.
 And, yes, you can set these to Private IPs as well. It&#x27;s low-risk to do that, AFAICT.
 And, I have a bash script that works on my linux server and my macbook that works with arrays and other goodies to help me quickly set the IPs (cron jobs too) by using Cloudflare&#x27;s API.
 Now, I no longer need to mess with my AdGuardHome instance because, via standard DoH or DoT, I can access all the DNS records I&#x27;d need for public or private use.

                              <span>I run Meshcommander and it works great.. i have full access and remote desktop to my 3 VPRO systems..
 Figured i&#x27;d give meshcentral a go and for some reason i can only hit 2 of the 3 systems.. and the 2 seem to alternate depending on which system i&#x27;ve rebooted most recently.. I can&#x27;t make head nor tail of it..
 Is there any alternative to meshcentral for a webui to manage multiple vpro systems with remote desktop capabilities?
 Edit : i&#x27;ve figured out what&#x27;s going on.. i&#x27;m hosting Meshcentral on a vps and have 3 tailscale failover subnet routers.. one on each vpro server as an LXC.. it all depends on which subnet router is being used.. whichever it is is the one i cannot access from meshcentral... i&#x27;ll bring it in house and away from the subnet routers and that should solve my issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently accessing my self hosted applications through a VPN (ZeroTier). The problem with this approach is that each user that wants to use a service, or even myself, needs to join the ZT network, and have it enabled. Even if other people were not to use the network, it&#x27;s still bothersome to me, since the ZT network on my phone consumes a lot of battery, and all the traffic is going through it which I&#x27;m not too fond of.
 So the option is obviously opening ports. However this has security risks which I don&#x27;t want to have, and I began looking for alternatives. It seems that a tunnel with Cloudflare would be a good option, but there&#x27;s some thing I want to understand about it.
 Cloudflare seems to simplify security, since they automatically detect and block suspicious connections, and they offer many tools to manually restrict connections with various arbitrary filters. However, let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s some services I self host that I want to allow everyone to access, and there&#x27;s some others that I want to restrict to selected users, how risky is this? Isn&#x27;t a chain as strong as its weakest link?
 If I have an application open to the public, couldn&#x27;t a vulnerability in that application compromise my entire network? Assume each application is running on its own docker container of course.
 I use a reverse proxy with nginx to access each service with a subdomain. Does Cloudflare limit my ability to do this in any way? I saw that I may need to add applications one by one, can I use a wildcard redirect or something?
 And also, does Cloudflare have data limits and speed limits? Since all my traffic would be going through them via the tunnel... I guess this is par for the course. It would really suck if that&#x27;s the case, but I guess deep down I already know the answer.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have gotten very interested in citrix storefront (web ui) and citrix desktop (Essentially bringing a vm to another device). Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM&#x27;s or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. 
 Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can&#x27;t be the whole solution because it can&#x27;t autocreate/allocate VM&#x27;s for users and doesn&#x27;t shutdown when not not in use. Doesn&#x27;t help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can&#x27;t auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically
 I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly. But sometimes I wish I could just spin up a VM with an easier user interface or create a new user with a VM already allocated that could be connected to easily.

                              <span>Some people want to use a computer in a room other than the PC is in. That&#x27;s where these various keywords come in: Remote desktop / KVM over IP / 100ft+ HDMI cable.
 Overall: this is a niche market. higher lag uses are allegedly mostly covered by RDP. I am going to put my gaming PC at my TV and any office work will hopefully be within the cheaper, laggier options like RDP.
 Here&#x27;s a summary of some things you can search for.
 Remote desktop / RDP
  
requires windows pro or similar
 presumably laggier than a direct wire solution
  
Non RDP software solutions
  
teamviewer
 anydesk ($120/year) https://anydesk.com/en/order
 p2p https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/p2p
 supremo https://www.supremocontrol.com/pricing/
 synergy
 barrier https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Pi-kvm
  
1080p50 (not a typo) x1 monitor
 $275 assembled + needed parts (power supply)
  
bliKVM
  
uses pikvm
 lives in pcie?
 https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Thunderbolt docks + Corning optical thunderbolt
  
$550ish for cable. additional dock cost
 hand assembled in clean rooms
  
Level1techs KVM
  
not directly relevant but good KVMs are hard to come by
 can&#x27;t vouch for it but has the right buzzwords
 https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-usbc-model
 he mentions around the 5m mark in the video that you can use a pi-kvm to chain a non-IP KVM over IP. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LwsznhIBPMc
  
Keywords to look for:
  
optical
 fiber
 KVM
 KVM over IP
 KVM over copper
 HDMI over ethernet
 thinclient
 hdBaseT
 displayport (seems to support more than HDMI)
 note the differences between displayport 1.2, 1.4 etc. and the daisy chain possibilities in there.

 I&#x27;m primarily using it to display information from PADD for the Pi-hole on my network, but I am curious what others may use it for.

                              <span>I currently have Windstream and they are using VDSL2 modems. It’s one of those router/WiFi/modem in a box type of devices.
 I want a VDSL2 modem that’s just…a modem, nothing else. It seems impossible to five though. No luck on Amazon.
 Any brand/models you guys would recommend that would just be a plan old VDSL2 modem and nothing else?

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I got a DL360 Gen9 recently and it came with 32GB of ram 4GB x 8 sticks, I plan to install a second cpu in the socket and buy another 32gb of ram 16GB x 2 sticks.
 What would be a the optimal way of slotting them. I was thinking of leaving the current setup on socket 1 where its all the black and white slots, slotted. and placing the 2 16gb sticks in L + j slot in the second cpu.

                              <span>So here’s the plan… 1. modify my old Honda generator for pushbutton electric start 2. Setup my UPS to trigger a relay to start the genny 3. Put it outside the window of my homelab along with a big reserve tank for gas (this takes care of noise and exhaust) and run a power cord into the lab 4. Somehow (maybe some sort of relay system) when the genny kicks on, it switches the PDU over from the UPS supply to the genny supply.
 Voila! Hours and hours and hours of uninterruptible power so my Minecraft server will never go down!
 Overkill?

                              <span>I want to create a high availability cluster in my homelab and (it may not be 100% necessary but) I want to use 5 of the same exact machine. I don’t have 5 of any version of Raspberry Pi and it would be cost prohibitive to do so. And since demand is high for Pi’s…
 The thin clients I’m looking at have AMD quad core processors (2.4 GHz) and come with 8GB RAM and 64GB SSDs. Power consumption is typically around 15W and being x86, I’ll never have to worry about finding compatible Docker images. Best of all, they’re going for around $50 each, so my existing Pi collection - even selling them for less than the crazy top-dollar prices currently found on eBay - should pay for 5 thin clients. (That’s important because I’m currently unemployed and can’t add any $ to make this happen.)
 Does this seem like a good idea to you? If not, why not?
 Thanks for your time and consideration!

                              <span>So its only recently occurred to me that I should prob be saving my 2FA backup codes in a better way than putting them in a TXT file. How do you all store your 2FA Backup codes? is there something that I can throw in docker to save them?

                              <span>To clarify what I mean in the title: I need help deciding on the best method to use for remoting into my homelab/network from the outside.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve currently got three options I&#x27;m deciding between, and I&#x27;m not sure which one would be the best long-term. 
 ​
 Option 1: I have a router that has VPN capability built in. I can set up the VPN on the route, download the OVPN client, put it on whatever device I will need to have access the home network, badabing badaboom.
 Option 2: Bastion host. I have a few spare devices I could turn into a bastion. Got a Lenovo T470 that isn&#x27;t currently doing much, got a RaspberryPi 4 that isn&#x27;t doing much, I could also spin up a VM on proxmox to act as a bastion.
 Option 3: Jump server. This one honestly seems a bit overkill and superfluous. The idea of hitting a machine then having to reauthenticate to another machine on my home network just sounds like a chore (I&#x27;ve also heard some people argue that in the modern cloud a bastion host is a type of jump server, I disagree, but I digress).
 ​
 So what I&#x27;m looking for is just to get some ideas about what others have done for their home network and how well it&#x27;s been working from a security standpoint and a reliability standpoint.
 Thanks in advance!

 Curious how I&#x27;m supposed to use it / what I&#x27;m supposed to do with it.
 Edit- can someone ELI5 what the free tier is? Like … what do I get? Is it just a VM? I’m totally green when it comes to this.

                              <span>Hey reddit :D i have questions..
 fiber scared me as of now but as the days go on, my lab and date requirements expand, and the distances I need that data to travel fiber is becoming the only option. So fiber it is but im kind of walking into it blind so here I am turning to the smart people of reddit.
 ​
  
I have unifi gear, does ubiquiti have their own transceivers? or do they just use the same ones? format? standard? as someone else like cisco?
  
​
  
 multimode LC is the best for what i want right? (long 10g run through conduit)
  
​
  
 do i need to find the distance and buy the correct length? and if so where? fs.com? or do i want to learn how to terminate fiber.. which from what ive seen isnt rly something you just.. do.
  
​
  
how far under the rated distance can I be before i risk burning out the receiver?.
  
​
 i think thats all, thank you all in advance.

                              <span>So, was going to add drives and just found that one of my raid drives has an error, fuck me, tried to identify the drive, and then remembered an issue I had noticed but didn&#x27;t think much of...
 I have two P822 controllers in my dl380 g6, to replace the p822 on the original backplanes, and they aren&#x27;t able to turn on the blue led to identify the drive in question. 
 Is there some sort of fix for this? It seems odd that they don&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s all HP oem hardware. 
 I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a seating issue or something from cleaning a while back, two drives read &quot;5TB SATA 512e HDD&quot; but the bad one reads &quot;5TB SATA HDD&quot;, not too sure why as I haven&#x27;t dug in too far yet as I&#x27;m occupied, but wanted to get this posted.

I&#x27;d like to spend as little as possible while also not wanting to pull my hair out after an hour if that makes sense.

 The words can be heard by clicking on the small speaker icon. But there doesnt seem to be an easy way to download the .wavs themselves. The only way i have found so far is to right click &gt; inspect element. I do know the source url though: https://www.learnpunjabi.org/stat_sound/1.wav. 
 But since we are talking 500 files this would take a long time.
 Is there an easier faster way with which i can download all the wav&#x27;s in bulk? I know python if that helps.

                              <span>This might interest some of you. SanDisk has a lifetime warranty on a lot of their flash media, including MicroSD cards, which I have a lot of for various uses. Their cards don&#x27;t fail on me often, but a couple times now, it&#x27;s happened. The first instance, my MicroSD card was replaced with another unit of the one that failed, as expected. But this recent failure was a 200GB card, and I guess they didn&#x27;t have any more 200GB cards laying around, because they sent me a 400GB card to replace it. Pretty good stuff.
 tl;dr SanDisk is real good with their warranties. Take advantage of them if you have the chance.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 So im doing some research on how events affect donation behaviour. I hope to match news coverage of a specific area with donations to its main NGO. I have the donations data - but I need to figure out to how to scrap data on news for this location (its usually on the news worldwide). What I mostly need is: date of news, is it generally positive or negative, and country(If possible). To some extent also &quot;intensity&quot; of coverage. Any ideas where I could start ? Pretty new on coding so maybe worth mentioning that

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve currently got a 14TB WD sitting on my desk full of legally ripped media and home movies. It was getting close to capacity so I picked up 3 more 14TB hard drives a few weeks ago during a sale. I have a total of 4 14TB HDDs now, 1 basically full. I&#x27;ve also got a 10TB synology DS220+ I back up critical files to that&#x27;s mostly empty. 
 I was thinking about going with single disk parity on TruNAS or Unraid. I&#x27;d set it up first with the 3 new drives and copy all my media over from my desk. Then I&#x27;d shuck the WD and add it to my server. I&#x27;d then then compress everything to a backup archive once a week and send it to my synology server (I can add 1 more drive to this if needed). 
 Thoughts on the setup? Also advice on TruNAS vs Unraid would be appreciated!

 I would most likely use the NAS for backups and not edit video from it or anything like that. Do you guys think I could trust these drives? Should I maybe way for a better deal?

 I&#x27;ve tried looking online but searching &quot;Wookieepedia archive&quot; only gives fandom articles on archives which exist in the SW universe.
 I just despise the fandom website so much that I wanted my own copy of the old Wookieepedia.

                              <span>I’m on the road a lot, with a huge amount of video files to edit on a MacBook Pro. My solution for video storage is multiple external SSDs for different projects (four currently), but I don’t like them just rattling around in a pocket of my laptop bag. Does anyone know of a smallish storage case that will hold multiple SSDs? I’m imagining something like the CD wallet I used to carry in my car back before the days of MP3s. I can find soft cases meant for a single drive, but haven’t found anything that will hold multiple drives.

                              <span>I have 28TB in a Synology 5-bay NAS, and am reaching reasonable limits to upgrading within the five bays, so I was considering just building a custom NAS in an old PC case and running my storage/Plex of TrueNAS (haven&#x27;t decided yet fully). The current drives are all still good and I would like to reuse them, but the data is stored in an SHR raid. I have a cloud backup in Synology&#x27;s proprietary&#x27;s HyperBackup format.
 Is there a smart way of moving my data onto the new system once I have it set up, or do I need to download the backup data and hope all works out with the Synology backup explorer (which I can only really test once I&#x27;ve deleted the original SHR data off the hard drives)?

                              <span>what i&#x27;m looking to do is set up something to sync a folder on my desktop every couple of days to a folder on Box. i am on a company laptop so i can&#x27;t download any software or use Time Machine, even tho i&#x27;m on a mac, because they don&#x27;t allow apple IDs. 
 Is there another way to do this? i also have dropbox acct, is there a way to do it with that? i want the files to reside on my HD and just be synced/backed up to a cloud folder.

 I&#x27;ve created a tool to aid in downloading all the content from services.
 Currently it supports
  
Itch.io games
 Humble Bundle Library
 Opera Vision Performances
 NASA&#x27;s APOD (more of an example really)

 ​
 With Hacktoberfest this month, if people want to submit patches for different services, I&#x27;ll happily review and merge them

                              <span>How do you check if your videofiles dont have any problems after you get them?
 I mean stuff like, overall file corruption or that it didnt cut out in the middle of the episode (sth like autocompare the length to tvdb)
 Whats the best way to check for this (besides going through everything manually) bc the data it would need is already there. 
 Does a program for that already exist?

                              <span>I&#x27;m backing up 100+TB of data. Do you all configure your backup NAS to also have disk redundancy or do you just leave them as individual volumes and script out rsync or robocopy to backup individual folders from the main NAS?
 I&#x27;m thinking that if I skip RAID on this particular backup (non-critical data), that if a hard drive pukes on the backup NAS I will plug in a fresh hard drive and restore from the production NAS (RAID 6) and then I don&#x27;t have to blow money on extra $300 drives that I don&#x27;t need.

(The SSD would be a boot drive, so I&#x27;m assuming the frequent reads/writes would make running TRIM beneficial compared to an SSD used solely for mass storage.)

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I have a question at the moment. When or with what reasons to create a new Docker stack for your self-containers?
 For context:
 I have a Synology NAS and I use Docker to run my applications. The *arr, Jellyfin, Heimdall, Calibre-web, Dazzle, Portainer, Duplicati, Vaultwarden, Watchtower, VPN client and 2 VPN connected download services and others.
 Portainer is run separately and all other services in a docker-compose (a stack in Portainer).
 The domain name and subdomains are managed by Synology.
 I want to add Swag instead of Synology&#x27;s reverse proxy. Because I have to open a lot of firewall ports to make it work with Synology&#x27;s reverse proxy and I don&#x27;t like it.
 After that, I want to use Home Assistant because I have many sensors in my apartment.
 Then add a Grafana to monitoring the services.
 And Authelia or Authentik
 So the stack is starting to have a lot of services. And I&#x27;m wondering if I should separate it or not. But I can&#x27;t think of any good reasons. And if I do. Do I have to manage 2 watchtower services and 2 swags? One per stack?
 ​
 Sorry for the language.
 Thx for the sharing

                              <span>I use a portainer stack for my docker compose and npm for my reverse proxy. Basically, I want to no longer be able to access the apps by typing in the ip:port, but through the reverse proxy. Would definitely love if there was some way I could do this in the portainer gui.
 My ultimate goal is to use the docker npm as the way to access my apps internally with simple names like homer.server.local or something like that. Then have another reverse proxy to use for external access pointing to the internal names.

                              <span>Hi everyone . I just came across a free waf like solution which integrates with Nginx.
 Openappsec.io
 Seems like it is made by Check Point . Looks to be better than everything else that available free from a WAF function perspective .
 Keen to see if anyone has any experiences with it ?

                              <span>Whilst this isn&#x27;t strictly selfhosted.. this &quot;server&quot; is part of my selfhosted solution so i hope you don&#x27;t mind..
 I run an Hp Microserver Gen 8 with a Xeon 1265L.. it&#x27;s got 2 16TB Red Pros in it..
 The OS is Windows 10 LTSC.
 There&#x27;s a couple of bus powered USB drives attached but for the majority of the day, it sits idle..
 It&#x27;s pullin a pretty constant 50w of power..
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why.. i&#x27;m hoping someone can tell me &quot;it&#x27;s your CPU&quot; or something similar to stop me endlessly searching for a software solution.
 CPU usage sits at around 14% due to Blueiris and Goodsync running..
 Any help to get this thing running a bit cheaper would be appreciated!

                              <span>My AWS SES credentials got leaked because of a dumb error on my part, and got picked up into a spam campaign that sent 70k emails. I&#x27;ve fixed the issue and locked things down, but all my personal emails are now going to spam, especially for gmail.
 I&#x27;ve gotten myself off of blocklists and my IP reputation and domain reputation shows to be okay on places like Talos and Spamhaus, however gmail still is marking my emails in spam.
 Is my domain permanently screwed now? I will never send any number of high volume emails from this domain because its for personal use only. Will it basically be impossible to rebuild my domain reputation because of low volume? Will the reputation recover over time even if I&#x27;m sending a very very low volume of emails?
 I don&#x27;t host my own email, I forward to Office 365, and use AWS SES to send automated emails to myself for home automation purposes. In hindsight I should&#x27;ve used a disposable domain for automated emails for this reason. 
 As much as possible, I&#x27;d like to keep this domain because it&#x27;s my family name.

                              <span>Hey!
 I&#x27;m getting more and more services in my selfhosted setup, some of them would benefit from having a mail account set up. So I was thinking about a mail server for just internal use. I would set it up with whatever DNS records are necessary and then restrict it again to local use. ideally, it comes with a web client.
 Any suggestions for what to use? Already checked out https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#communication---email---complete-solutions but can&#x27;t really decide, what&#x27;s useful.
 I&#x27;m running a Dell PC as server with Ubuntu 22.04 and Docker, I have a own (full) domain.

                              <span>I am trying out an Evernote replacement on Unraid using a Docker called Wiznote. Got it all working on a reverse proxy and the windows client, web client, and iOS client can all see the docker through my domain. However the time on the iOS app keeps coming up as UTC instead of GMT standard. 
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to change that. The windows client has the correct times however. Wiznotes support page mentions this but I have no idea how to enter the commands. Tried in console to no avail. Any help on how to do this and where greatly appreciated. Not so versed in console/terminal commands for linux. 
 &quot; 
 🕰Modify the Time Zone
 For example, change the time zone to UTC/GMT+08:00
 docker exec -it wiz /bin/bash cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime exit 
 ⏳Get local time zone
 Linux
 Add -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
 to the running command to get local time zone
 run --name wiz -it -d -v ~/wizdata:/wiz/storage -p 80:80 -p 9269:9269/udp -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime wiznote/wizserver 
 MacOS
 -e TZ&#x3D;&#x60;ls -la /etc/localtime | cut -d/ -f8-9&#x60;

                              <span>I have a query regarding a fresh install of wordpress in a docker container. I have my VPS, and my domain with Cloudflare points to it&#x27;s IP. I wish to use cloudflared to connect to the domain and any subs. Now, if I want wordpress installed to a subdomain &quot;wordpress.mydomain.com&quot;, do I have to change any ports in the docker-compose file? Or leave the default &quot;ports: - 8080:80&quot;? Or are there any other config or environmental variables I need to adjust?
 I will need to install nginx in a container afterwards as well, yes?
 I&#x27;d like the main url &quot;mydomain.com&quot; to host a different site/page, just a basic html/css entry page I can put together. And wordpress in the subdomain.
 Thank you.

                              <span>What happened?
 Hello all. I had to make a very painful data loss a few days ago due to an update error from NextCloudPi and had no backup for some now lost files.
 This now brings me to the point that I finally want to think about a backup strategy and I definitely need your help. I&#x27;ve always read a lot about this, but couldn&#x27;t really do anything with it because it was too abstract.
 What is the current status?
 I have a RAID 1 system with 2x 4TB NAS hard drives connected to my Ubuntu server. I never expected that a software error could delete all my cloud files, but now I&#x27;ve been proven wrong. I don&#x27;t do automated backups at all. At most, I manually copy the most important things to an external hard drive every few months.
 The file system is ext4.
 What I know could be helpful
 I know for example that there is btrfs as a file system and there is snapshot, but there it already starts, because I do not understand the functionality. Could that have helped me in my case where all the files were deleted? Then I know that there is rsync, which does more or less the same thing that RAID 1 already does (if I understood correctly).
 ​
 Of course, it would also be very efficient to save the data again on an external hard drive, for example. But I don&#x27;t know how this can be automated, because it would have to be connected all the time, which would quickly exceed the life of the hard drive. I definitely want to keep everything local and not fall back on external cloud providers such as Mega, Google, OneDrive, etc.
 ​
 So let&#x27;s first discuss the best realization in my case and possibly afterward how the whole thing is technically feasible. I want to make a backup of everything and not only of the data in the cloud but also of the rest. Thank you very much in advance!

                              <span>My server runs on open media vault 6 with docker. I want an application where I can use smb and the suggested application together. I tried file browser(docker application, that I like), but I cant use file explorer on my main machine to add files which reflect in file browser. 
 My use case is this: I want to add/remove files from my server through smb but through the internet(globally).(please do not recommend nextcloud or file run, they don&#x27;t work on my server, how so many times I try). Basically I want to add files in my explorer which will get stored in my server, but accesible non-locally.
 I don&#x27;t know how clearly I have explained my use case, sorry if I couldn&#x27;t help you understand.I dont know how else to put this.
 Thanks for helping out in advance.

                              <span>What self-hosted app do you find well managing your personal tasks/projects?
 I am looking for some basic app what would have the following features:
 - API
 - tasks properties like, due, label, title, desc, maybe custom one
 - projects (each project has own tasks)
 - project&#x27;s views (like see same tasks in different way like list or kanban)
 - filters and sort would be great
 ​
 ​
 Do you know something what may fit well? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I recently discovered this hobby of home server and inspired by posts here from dashboards full of apps, I decided to try to learn and do mine with a sbc that was lying around. I installed armbian and start to racking my brains trying to get started with docker.
 After I learned the basics of containers, I saw that it was relatively simple to deploy an application with docker, so a need arose: how will I be able to access them outside my local network? (By researching I found that accessing your local network through a vpn seems to be the easiest and most secure method).
 tl;dr: first I need to learn how to put domains on my local network instead of accessing the services by ip address and port. 
 e.g dashboard: 192.168.1.70:8080 -&gt; homer.pi 
 192.168.1.70:9000 -&gt; portainer.pi
 I didn&#x27;t find any guide for noobs, I just saw that I can do it through the pi-hole but I can&#x27;t direct to the ports, only to one address.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to load balance a media server between 2 sites connected via VPN with both sites hosting media files but the external IP pointing to one of the sites. I&#x27;m currently using Emby but the issue I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll run into is I&#x27;ve read the user &#x27;database&#x27; file isn&#x27;t able to be moved or copied while it&#x27;s open, so if a user connects to one server then disconnects and happen to reconnect to the other server depending on load, their &#x27;viewed programs&#x27; list or video resume point won&#x27;t be up to date.
 I&#x27;ve considered ESXi hosts at both locations that are able to clone but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s real time nor bi-directional?
 Or can anyone suggest another self hosted software that might be able to do the same, Plex or something?

                              <span>I use cloudflare mainly for the hiding the IP part, although I appreciate the whole thing. For video selfhosted sites, cloudflare sometimes does weird things and also it is against their policies to stream. But I am wondering, how else can self hosters hide their IP without cloudflare? Is this something I need to worry about? I am planning on adding a firewall machine in front of everything soon anyway, but not sure if that addresses the same thing, probably not.

                              <span>As the title states, I&#x27;m in search of an alternative to Textable ($5/mo). 
 It&#x27;s an online chat interface for SMS services provided by your own SIP provider using webhooks to send and receive.
 I&#x27;m getting ready to move a number I&#x27;ve used for a while to Flowroute, and I&#x27;d like to be able to send and receive messages in a similar way. I run FreePBX at home, but can&#x27;t find an integration that would provide what I&#x27;m looking for. 3CX PBX has an SMS/MMS chat feature, but it&#x27;s ~$150/year to use it.
 I&#x27;ve looked at Twilio, and they seem to have the APIs to do everything I want, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with any programming languages to write something to interface with it.
 I would love to be able to find something that works out of the box, but I&#x27;m open to something that would take a little work to get running.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can&#x27;t figure this problem out. I posted this before on here, but I cleaned the text up now and made the problem easier to understand, so I&#x27;m posting again. I&#x27;d appreciate any help on this as I&#x27;m really at my wits&#x27; end here.
 I&#x27;d like to use the NginxProxyManager container and have it only accessible when I connect to the server via Wireguard. But I can&#x27;t get it working.
 My configurations files are: - Wireguard compose file - NginxProxyManager compose file - What my firewall is currently like
 After deploying the previously mentioned files, I copied the Wireguard peer configuration into the app on my computer and connected to it. The issue is that nothing is accessible. I can&#x27;t Google anything, I can&#x27;t ping anything, and doing localhost:81 or server-ip:81 does nothing as well.
 I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a firewall issue either, as when I disable it on my server and try to access any site on my computer there&#x27;s no change.
 Here are the Wireguard and peer configuration files, with all keys redacted: - Wireguard configuration file - Peer configuration file
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant but the proxy network in docker has a subnet of 172.18.0.0/16 and a gateway of 172.18.0.1.
 I feel like the issue may be the AllowedIPs section in wg0.conf but I&#x27;m not sure, plus since I have a dynamic IP how would I even have it in a form where I don&#x27;t need to keep on editing it every time my IP changes?

                              <span>Hi friends. We have a bargain outlet store locally and I looked in their locked high-tech cabinet today and noticed a Unifi UGS device was listed for $80 new in the box. Did a few searches and saw that it seemed like a good deal. I have always used the off the shelf routers like netgear....etc and figured this would be something fun to learn how to use and add to my home network. Can it be set up and used without having to purchase other devices? In other words replace my Netgear router for starters?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I don&#x27;t know if it is the right subreddit to post this, but I believe it will fit.
 I&#x27;m actually the happy owner of a dell R715 (Dual AMD Opteron 6320 + 256GB of DDR3 ECC). And I just setup jellyfin on it and then I wondered if I could put a GPU inside the server. Hopefully this server already have x16 pci riser so I could put any gpu I wanted. But I noticed that this server doesn&#x27;t have any extra plug to add more powerful GPU like some server do. 
 So at first my head turned over my collection of old GPU, and I wonder if any of them could help in that regards (even just a little bit):
  
ATI RADEON HD X1300
 ATI RADEON HD 2400 PRO
 ATI RADEON HD 2400XT
 ATI RADEON HD 3450
 ATI RADEON HD 6350
 NVIDIA QUADRO FX 370
 NVIDIA GEFORCE 6200TC
 NVIDIA 7300GS
 NVIDIA 8400GS
  
The Radeon 6350 is the most recent of the bunch if i&#x27;m not mistaken, but I don&#x27;t know if it is useful or not in this scenario.
 I&#x27;m also wondering what if I buy a new GPU, what is the best cheap GPU for this purpose (used or new) Should I buy an older quadro ? Should I buy a 1030 or 1650 ? And what would be the downside of each ?
 Thank you for any help ! Have a nice day !

 As the title suggests, I need help. Since Dell decided to downgrade their user experience by pulling the platform specific bootable ISO, we&#x27;ve been force to use the repository manager, except the user experience of it is the equivalent of rubbing my bare genitals against hot gravel, and fails to produce anything bootable, when it does decide to download something.
 ​
 I was wondering if anyone had one they backed up or saved.

 So far I&#x27;ve scored a couple of Dell T5810s workstation and an unmanaged 5-port switch as well as two Thinkpads for my homelab. I don&#x27;t know how I can start to begin processing it as I am somewhat of a novice, but I&#x27;ve got a couple of idea. The workstations themselves I think are around on the older side of Intel Xeon processors, and are mostly 16GB of ram without any sort of max storage. My idea was to get a couple of SSDs &amp; HDDs and two more graphic cards (one is rocking a 1060, so I&#x27;ll probably grab a few more or update to a 1660) to do some machine learning, but I don&#x27;t know where to start on that end.
 My eventual goal as someone who want to potentially be an IT professional, I want to at least have an environment where

Two of the drives are in the bottom of the case with no air flow, so I run the case without the front panel and a box fan in front of it, obviously not ideal I am ready to move on.
 I do not have a rack and not going that route, but if some type of rack mount style is the only thing with good airflow for 10x drives I would be willing to make it work. My mobo is mATX if that matters.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;d like to replace my enterprise servers with something less (noise-making, power-hogging, heat-creating, space-occupying) and more (processing power, memory).
 Currently I&#x27;m using Proxmox to run 3 or 4 VMs on an ML110G7 with 16GB that&#x27;s been working fine for years, but the E3-1220 is starting to pant a bit under load. It&#x27;s hosting Homeassistant (OS) , Jellyfin, LMS/Subsonic and Piwigo, each on separate guest machines (I know I could run them all in docker, but.. I don&#x27;t wanna).
 My thoughts are to replace the ML with either a couple of HP Elite or ProDesk minis for a slight processing upgrade, or a single Beelink SER with a Ryzen 5 or 7 for a bigger bump. Prices are roughly comparable for 2x micro business desktops or one beefier Beelink. Think around $500 CAD.
 I don&#x27;t need dual NICs (or &gt;1Gbps), don&#x27;t need more GPU grunt than the iGPUs, and 32GB ram is plenty for the use case, so expandability isn&#x27;t a concern. 
 Your thoughts on mini business DTs vs Beelink (or similar) mini-pcs?

                              <span>I have a cyberpower UPS battery 1500VA with a odd enviroment
 Situation: there is a powercut in my house and UPS ran out of battery after some minutes.
 When power returns, seconds later i turn on the UPS battery and it shows a 100% charged battery!! (which have no sense)
 later, when there is another powercut, UPS battery ran out of energy in seconds too... (like never charged)
 this is a issue with the battery so i have to replace it? or is directly a UPS glitch so i have to get a new UPS?
 or every time UPS get out of battery i must wait 12 hours letting charging turned off and all the previous is an expected environment? 
 PD: didn&#x27;t found a UPS battery group here in reddit, only the UPS delivery service xD sorry if here is not the appropiate place
 thanks in advance

                              <span>I have an probably 10 year old Alienware desktop I&#x27;ve been thinking about turning into a server. I&#x27;m not planning or running very much on it, but I&#x27;m an IT student and it would be nice to have a home server to mess around with and test out things on. I&#x27;m concerned however about the power draw because I don&#x27;t want to spike my energy bill if I have it running 24/7. If I&#x27;m not running very much on it would the power draw still be pretty high, or would it scale more to the amount of use it gets?

                              <span>Hi there,
 First of all, lemme tell you that I love this subreddit :) Second of all, over the past few years and with my recent purchase of a Dell Powervault unit, I figured it&#x27;s a good opportunity to spend some time and budget to figure a rack solution once for all and make sure things can run 24/7. The only issue is I live in a small apartment and this Dell unit I bought is way nosier than I could&#x27;ve imagined. I explored immersion cooling and quite server cabinets (cuz I am a noise freak) but the price for both of these were quite hefty and opening a brand new dell storage to do DIY cooling in 4u is also not an option because it messes up with the warranty and same thing is almost true with immersion cooling as well.
 So, in the end, I found myself thinking more about different spaces in…</span>

                              <span>Since neither my country require, nor our phone provider have a designated demarcation point on-premise (you are even allowed to run the cable up until the neighborhood cabinet, but not inside it), and I finally have the tools required to diagnose our issues, I have decided to start testing (and at the same time, identify which socket is connected where)... Only problem is, I have no idea what to make of the connectors, since while I know that only two wires connect each socket (we have a similar system to BT&#x27;s here in the walls, however it is wired differently, with the red wire at pin 3 and the blue wire at pin 4), I cannot seem to understand how to test points that have 4 wires connected (two at the top, two at the bottom).
 Of course, I have disconnected the home phone and the DSL (technically VDSL2, with support for at least profile 30a, perhaps profile 35b, although it only has a 100Mbps RJ-45 port) modem/wired router beforehand, and only reconnected them to post this.
 Here is a picture to illustrate what I mean: https://0x0.st/o49r.jpg (I cannot seem to upload to IMGUR with Sync for Reddit)
 I do plan to replace all of our BT sockets with RJ-11 sockets, just to make troubleshooting far easier, since most equipment cannot connect directly to BT for testing (I also need to test cables, after all), with LeGrand&#x27;s modules making things easier for me there (I will be running both CAT5e for phone and CAT6A for networking, in preparation for my future homelab, after all), and for that I first need to ascertain what plugs where, especially since I need to move where the DSL modem/wired-router is physically connected.

 Hey guys - current config is internet into my Asus router, which has been great but it&#x27;s reached end-of-software-support and my (wired) network is getting too big for it, so I&#x27;ve roped in another wifi router with NAT turned off to give me +4 RJ45 ports... not ideal. 
 So anyway, I just built a pfSense box and I have a 24-port Cisco 3560 I found in the trash at work. So my plan is as in the linked image at top:
 Internet into pfSense, then on into the Cisco (SFP port 1). SFP port 2 of the Cisco (SFP) will go into the Asus in WAP mode to handle the wifi traffic.
 This page ( https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-vlans-in-pfsense/ ) gives a decent overview of setting up VLANs to segregate traffic but it indicates I&#x27;ll need to assign VLANs in the switch as well. I can do this but then it begs the question about wireless devices... 
 I imagine the &quot;Trusted Systems&quot; VLAN devices will have access to each other, the internet, and my file server.
 IOT will have access to each other and pfSense NTP.
 Guest will have access only to the internet.
 Since wireless devices will all be coming into the Cisco through one SFP port, I can&#x27;t just assign that port to one VLAN; if pfSense is handling DHCP, presumably I can use different subnets for the devices by individually assigning IPs.
 By default, new devices would be part of Guest until moved into Trusted or IOT... which is the gap in my current understanding. 
 Thoughts? What am I missing here? Thanks in advance! I&#x27;m happy to learn by messing around but since I&#x27;ll be taking down the entire home network to do this, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t take too long. ;)

So with that in mind, how do you all store all of your spare parts so it doesn&#x27;t look crummy? I have dozens of sticks of memory, hundreds of screws, various expansion cards, multiple video cards, motherboards, HSF assemblies, I mean you name it and I&#x27;ve probably got a dozen or more.

                              <span>Hi, I am currently using SyncbackFree V10 to backup my files locally. However, the free version does not support versioning and the license for the paid version is valid only for the version that you paid for. Currently they are in V10 and I&#x27;m not sure when they will update to V11. I&#x27;m worried that if I pay for V10, they will update to V11 very quickly, then I have to pay again. 
 For cloud backup, I currently don&#x27;t have any. I do have a Nextcloud server set up and is using the Nextcloud software to sync certain folders/files.
 I&#x27;m trying to see if there are better alternatives, free or paid. If free, I need versioning as my critical files are changing everyday and I schedule daily backups for those files &amp; folders. If paid, is there a better licensing method compared to Syncback?
 My requirements are as follows:
 1) Local backups and Nextcloud server backups
 2) Able to choose which folders/files to backup for Nextcloud separately from local backups
 3) Versioning
 4) Incremental Backup
 5) Scheduling
 6) File integrity check
 7) Need to be able to restore individual files
 8) I&#x27;m not sure if I need image backups as sometimes I like to wipe my computer clean and reinstall only the software that I really need at that time. A lot of crap can build up over months/years of using the computer and I do not want those crap to be restored.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m an aspiring data hoarder with no coding, Linux, or PC building experience (though I&#x27;d be open to trying these things) who is in need of a personal data storage/server solution.
 I would like a storage solution that can hold on to at least 20TB of files without risk of sudden failure (&quot;redundancy drive&quot; seems to be a key term here). It needs to be able to handle multiple python scripts running at all times to record Twitch streams while serving video via Plex or Jellyfin.
 Bonus points for upgradability. The cheaper the solution that meets all these requirements, the better. Feel free to go over on price as much as needed. I&#x27;m aware that $500 is probably optimistic.

                              <span>I want to have my data, which is currently about 1.8 TB, encrypted and secured with a filesystem having the nice features of checksumming and compression.
 My storage media: 
  
My Passport (WDC WD20NMVW-11EDZS2) 2TB USB external HDD (My main disk)
 An old 1TB laptop HDD (2.5”) now in an HDD caddy inside my laptop
 An old 1TB 3.5” HDD that connects via a SATA-USB adapter
  
The latter two disks have successfully gone through badblocks and smartctl tests, so I assume they are wiped and ready to go.
 I use a 250GB SSD for my Windows and Linux dual-boot installation, and I don&#x27;t intend to include it in my setup.
 Unfortunately, at this moment I can&#x27;t afford adding a new device (I live in a very poor country with hyperinflation).
 BTRFS and ZFS seem to be the most popular and suitable ones for me, but don’t know if BTRFS has completely healed its bad reputation. ZFS sounds interesting and I really want to learn it, but I don’t know if ZFS is recommendable for my small setup, plus, my RAM is 12GB and non-ECC . I’ve also read about some filesystems that would cause problems if you run out of space, I want to avoid them.
 The ability to access the FS on Windows is good, but not completely necessary. WinBTRFS doesn’t seem to be 100% reliable to not corrupt the data on Windows… but not sure.
 So what filesystem do you recommend to me? What encryption scheme is recommended? I’ve heard that some filesystems have builtin encryption. I assume, first I have to create an encrypted filesystem on the two other HDDs and copy the files to them. Then I should wipe the external HDD, and create a filesystem on it and copy the files back.
 Your help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hello! Just wondering because I&#x27;m searching for more drives for my main system and I don&#x27;t want it to be too loud. As far as I know, Exos are the best TB-per-dollar but also the loudest drives so I want to know if getting WD Red or Red Plus is better if I don&#x27;t want the system to be loud. (8 to 12TB drives)
 It&#x27;s just for multimedia storage btw

                              <span>I understand this is very much a non-issue, but the current FAQ section under our Wiki is... not good. The only potentially good thing(s) are the two links to more information on downloading reddit profiles. We (and by we, I mean the mods) should either make an actual FAQ or just remove the section entirely.
 Again, I know it&#x27;s a non-issue, just wanted to post my thoughts. Being stuck at home with covid is boring.

                              <span>I only have a laptop. I guess that rules out 3.5” hard disks which I read here as good ones.
 I don’t have data more than 2TB right now. So I want to buy a 2TB HDD. But I read here that 2.5” hdd below 8TB are generally SMR and not that great quality wise.
 I have a sale going on in my country on WD and Seagate HDD. 
 Question:is it a good decision to buy a 2TB wd or seagate HDD or shell out more money and buy 3.5” HDD with a case to use with a laptop? 
 I want to use this as a backup hard disk.

Does anyone know of a database or a website that might store some of this information.? Anything is much appreciated, I&#x27;ll just create the database little by little. I know it&#x27;s possible to scrape Twitter but not for the volume I want

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I neglected my backups. There, I said it. I gotta change something about it though and I would like to learn about the dos and don&#x27;ts.
 I got a small server I would like to backup. I intend to use restic for it.
 Is the following approach already fine? Or am I missing something?
  
There&#x27;s a restic repository on the server where I backup my files to.
 I sync the restic repository to an external drive.
 I sync the external drive to another external drive (weekly).
 I upload the contents of the external drive into my cloud.
  
Thanks a lot!

                              <span>So due to many terrible political decisions made recently and not-so-recently, electricity prices in the UK are rising absurdly quickly at the moment. 
 Just over 2 years ago we were paying 13.31p/kWh. Prices more than doubled in April this year and are going up again now to 34p/kWh. Business rates are as high as 93p/kWh.
 I&#x27;m currently running a 12 bay Supermicro server with 128 GB RAM and dual Xeon E5-2650 v2. It uses approx 4.2 kWh per day so running costs have gone up from £17/month to £44/month and are set to rise more soon.
 I&#x27;d like to move to a more power efficient option to save money. I don&#x27;t desperately need the dual Xeons, all I need is the following
  
10-12 bays
 enough processing/GPU to be able to run Plex for 1-2 people
 2 ethernet ports
 quiet enough in a cupboard
 nice to have at least one ethernet port 10 GbE
  
If I can spend a few hundred quid on lower-power hardware, I&#x27;ll make my money back in a couple of years.
 What are my options? I&#x27;m up for any ideas about more efficient hardware than can still hold a decent number of drives. I&#x27;d probably prefer not to build in a PC case as I&#x27;m sure there are lower power prebuilt options but I&#x27;m open to almost anything.

                              <span>I remember them being advertised directly on wikipedia. I also remember seeing used ones on ebay at some point.
 I am trying to get a hold of them. I remember many many articles changing and entire articles removed that used to exist. I am trying hard to find one of these dvd&#x27;s.
 ​
 *Update: I was able to download a 200gb tar file of an old wikipedia, but now every app I try to use to open it crashes. File&#x27;s too big :(

I went to the wiki on this sub and I tried YouTube-dl-gui but it was taking forever to even download one video. Is there a way to speed up the download for that or is there a better program to use. Thanks

 -R  Repeat fill/test/wipe steps given number of times. 
 What this does. It automatically reads and writes enough &quot;random&quot; to your disk drive optimizing your $badclustr file to lock out all the bad spots on your disk.
 Application? Particularly useful on worn out disks, but will work with new also. Unattended cleanup so you can use that disk again (or use it for cold archives).

                              <span>on the 29th march, 2019, this video was uploaded to youtube. This is a public record of an aim game, currently world record.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;brS9f4qaSQk&amp;t&#x3D;7s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;NeoNinja
 However, on the 25th april 2018, a previous video of this same aim game was uploaded, with the youtube ID https://youtu.be/1qL0rFGB2LA
 The reason why this is so significant is because the score difference between them is about 5 seconds of gameplay. almost a whole year of training to gain 5 seconds on an aim game (because it is so difficult).
 the only place i&#x27;ve seen a snipper of the old aim video is here, at this timestamp specifically. https://youtu.be/E8NtJtyKX-Y?t&#x3D;133
 I&#x27;ve searched twitter, old video statistic websites, old forums. Through these searches, I even found a video uploaded the day…</span>

                              <span>I am sure many of you know this already, but Newegg has been selling the Exos 14TB (new) for $199.99 over the last few weeks. Today, with the new ZIP buy-now-pay-later 15% off promotion, the price is $170, which equates to $12/TB. You can save up to $100 on the promo, which is perfect for 3 drives (save $90).
 I know there are concerns about Newegg packaging and warranty, but this seems too good to pass up. My first time buying drives - I think you can just return them if they are damaged / not covered by Seagate warranty right?

                              <span>So I thought I future proofed myself for longer than I did but I&#x27;m getting to 70% used on my array and starting to look at expanding again. My problem is I have already used all of my pcie lanes and probably am overusing the pch as well and trying to figure out the best option to start adding more vdevs. 
 My goal is actually to add 4-6 20tb drives and 2 1tb ssds but I&#x27;m about out of sata ports before I even got to this point. Is it worth looking at threadripper or some cheaper modern xeons? 
 My current system running trunas core:
 11600k 32gb ram(probably need to up this to at least 64gb) 8 18tb hdds 3 2tb nvme 10gb mellonox card Lsi expansion that supports 8 drives.
 The motherboard has 4 sata ports but is using one for the boot drive and my thought was two other ones for the additional 1tb ssds.
 Just trying to see if anyone has run into a similar issue. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better to just get threadripper or a newer xeon/epyc or maybe at this point just source a cheap small system and have a secondary volume.

 Could also be an ok way to make a slc cache drive since they aren&#x27;t made anymore(?).

                              <span>(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T)
 Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but mighty NAS (mini-ITX) which is also going to he used as a web server, and one of the &quot;requirements&quot; are that jt should ideally consume as less power as possible since it&#x27;s going to stay on 24/7.
 Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:
  
TDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T
 frequencies, including the base frequency
  
So, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it&#x27;s the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.
 So yea I understand that the T under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.
 My concern is the following.
 When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? 
 The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.
 Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something?
 I&#x27;m asking here as there&#x27;s plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.
 Any advice or insights is very much appreciated.
 Thanks a lot! 😊

                              <span>I recently quick formatted a 5TB SMR seagate drive which was in cold storage for 5 years , then suddenly after my pc froze (not due to HD) while data was being written to it and it’s now showing 8 bad sectors then after I reset the pc again it showed 40 ? I’m now moving the data from it to another drive and it’s moving data fine but a few file are inaccessible unfortunately..can improper ejecting of a hardrive whilst writing to it cause bad sectors as it was totally fine before this ?? 
 Is this drive reusable? Please help my fellow data heads ⭐️😎

                              <span>I’m at my wits end. I can’t figure out what the problem is. Usb sticks work fine with USB ports. Everything is fine. I can read from the drive no problem. 
 But any form of file transfer from anywhere to the external hdd, or even a folder transfer within the external hdd resets the usb system(all connections reboot) it works fine on my desktop so the drive is I know the drive is fine. 
 I’d appreciate any tips or ideas? Part of me thinks it’s a permission issue within the drive but I have no way to be sure.

 (link is invalid, just an example)
 I tried putting the magnet link from an ed2k file onto a document.txt and upload it to IA but it seems it&#x27;s not finding the files. I&#x27;m not sure if IA can do the same with these as it can with torrent magnet links (paste the link on a text file, rename to something.torrent and IA will download the contents). I can&#x27;t seem to find the help page either where I saw this before, am under the impression AI could also grab ed2k/Kad metalinks but from my testing it can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sharing the file correctly and it has a couple more seeds.

                              <span>Hello, all of my mad data lads! I currently have a Supermicro Unraid setup with 130TBs of storage that I use primarily for Plex and personal video storage and I need your help.
 I started a pretty decent non-prof sports photography/videography business and am in need of a big time storage solution for long-term archival and some everyday usage. I wanted to build this out more &quot;officially&quot; and efficiently than my little at-home setup so I figured I would ask for some advice here. I&#x27;m also willing to &quot;hire&quot; someone (just out of my own pocket) if there was someone out there that could help me design and put a build together. 
 So my use case, here is what I am looking to do:
  
Have long-term storage for photos and primarily video of Las Vegas High School sports (we are starting with boys and girls basketball this year)
 Being able to store game film from every high school game each season and archive that footage for 10-20 years.
 Have a storage solution that will allow multiple video editors and contributors to edit video (premiere and final cut) from different storage areas directly (will have 5 Mac Studio computers located locally within the same office at the servers, so could do 10GBE runs, etc).
  
Based on the personal storage I have been using for the last 6 months of filming myself I can see how this is going to scale at a massive level and put me in what I would consider the &quot;DataHoarder&quot; zone! I appreciate any assistance from the community I could get for this and hopefully this post is in the right place.

                              <span>I have two servers locally that I want to verify that the data is truly a clone. What would be the best method to run a sha1/256 check against both copies and verify that they are truly the same? Both of these servers run Debian.
 Thanks
 Obviously I&#x27;m talking about datahoarder quantities, 100+ TB ~1,000,000 files

                              <span>Howdy. Picked up my first hard drive today and I&#x27;m pretty blown away by just how much space these bad boys have. I wanted to ask, how long do these things last? I&#x27;ve got the thing hooked up right next to my PS5, but I&#x27;ve got some concerns.
 Just how durable are these things, anyway? Will a power outage turn my data into Swiss cheese? Is there a shock-resistant case or something I can put around it? Is the 1% failure rate actually true? Or is that just a marketing thing? I really don&#x27;t know!
 So yeah. Apologies for the noobie questions, I just really want to make the most out of this thing without somehow screwing myself over.
 EDIT: Jeez. You guys are so passive aggresive. What&#x27;s wrong with you people?

                              <span>They&#x27;re much cheaper so tempting but because they&#x27;re refurbished, you&#x27;d think these can go wrong again? Is it worth the risk?

                              <span>tl;dr: if an Intel X540 overheats - what it do? does performance just drop or does it disconnect? I was under the impression of the latter. 
 anti tl;dr: I have two Intel X540s - one in my main PC (Windows 10), one in my server/NAS (Server 2022). Until today they were setup direct-attach. 
 Large transfers of single files (&gt; ~5GB) will start out saturating 10 GbE for a bit, drop to zero and hang, then pick back up. It&#x27;ll repeat it a few times over the course of a transfer. 
 On a 60GB mkv it happens about a half dozen times (all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it). Smaller files (&lt; ~5GB) are a non-issue. 
 I bought the NICs about two years ago and and tried to figure it out but couldn&#x27;t and assumed it was a quirk of direct attach. 
 Then I got a deal on a 10 GbE switch (Ubiquiti USW-Flex-XG) and set it up today. I made my X540s my primary NICs in each aaaaaaaand the problem is worse. I&#x27;m not even hitting 5 GbE, let alone 10 GbE. 
 Here&#x27;s iPerf3 - the result is the same in either direction.
 Here&#x27;s an actual transfer - all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it. this is to/from an NVME but it happens with any combination of drives (SATA SSDs, RAID 0 HDD array, other NVME). 
 The only thing I can come up with is maybe an overheating NIC? the X540 in my server has a 40mm fan strapped on it (because there&#x27;s room). The X540 in my main PC doesn&#x27;t have a fan because there&#x27;s no room for it and the heatsink is lava. but I was under the impression the NIC would drop if it overheats?
 Windows, Intel ProSET, and Ubiquiti all show 10 GbE. I also tried taking them off auto-negotiate and no difference. 
 Any big brains got any ideas?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve come across a Synology RS812RP+ for sale with 4 2TB Red drives included for £40. It&#x27;s pretty cheap but I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a really old bit of kit (2013). Despite that, is £40 worth it to just have a NAS as I don&#x27;t have one currently, or am I just paying to shift someone&#x27;s e-waste for them?

                              <span>Anyone have experience booting proxmox raid on bifurcated NVMEs on an r730?
 Ive tried using Clover, editing the image to load the NVME driver. Also tried proxmox bootloader.
 Proxmox installs on the MVMEs after creating the raid in the installer, but never boots to it after reboot.

                              <span>Hey. I know this question has been asked before but I still can&#x27;t find an answer that solves the problem I&#x27;m having.
 I have 3 systems, 1st my day-to-day Windows desktop, 2nd my Windows &#x27;cloud gaming&#x27; VM, and 3rd my TrueNAS system. My goal is to have all my games from Steam, Epic, Origin and GOG all installed to a Networked Drive/Folder that&#x27;s stored on the TrueNAS system, which is then accessible to my 1st and 2nd system.
 Most guides suggest mapping my network drive as normal and installing the games there. This however causes permission issues, which can sometimes be solved by mapping in privileged mode and others, games won&#x27;t even attempt to start.
 Another option which worked fine was mapping an iSCSI drive. However, this has the problem that only 1 system can access the drive (apparently you can have multiple, but it&#x27;s highly discouraged?). It also seems it&#x27;s only really good to set an allocated volume size, not just expand the until the drives get full. If I could do iSCSI, would this bypass the RAM and SSD cache I have for that pool?
 So my questions are, what should I do? and Is there an alternative I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hey guys! 
 I got an unused Fujitsu Futro PC here with a Intel Celeron J4105 and 8GB of RAM here. It only supports a single M.2 SSD, I had a 1TB drive lying around, that i built into it. I&#x27;d like to use this PC as a little NAS, to put some files onto it and make them accessible on my network. I would also like to put some videos and music on it and be able to stream it to my smartphone and TV at my home. 
 Which operating system would be the best fit for that? I looked into truenas and plex, but I don&#x27;t know if they are the best choice.

                              <span>So I have a challenging build I&#x27;m looking for input on. I&#x27;m looking to build an all-NVMe TrueNAS box with 10GbE using an X16 to 4x M.2 board with bifurcation. However the build is space constrained so I&#x27;m stuck with Mini-ITX boards. I&#x27;ve settled on two options I can find:
 AsRock Rack EPYC3101D4I-2T - EPYC 3101 4C/4T
 SuperMicro X10SDV-4C-TLN2F - Xeon D 1521
 The problem is I&#x27;m not sure how CPU constrained I will be with these boards given ZFS and the throughput NVMe can achieve, or if there are other options for boards.

                              <span>(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T, since I still have to decide what CPU to go for, but first I need to fully understand the T-series vs non-T matter)
 Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but relatively mighty NAS (mini-ITX, with Unraid) which is also going to be used as a web server, and one of the &quot;requirements&quot; are that it should ideally consume as less power as possible since it&#x27;s going to stay on 24/7.
 Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:
  
TDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T
 frequencies, especially the base frequency
  
So, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it&#x27;s the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.
 So yeah I understand that the T-series under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.
 My concern is the following.
 When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? 
 The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.
 Does this translate in less energy used by the T-series if compared to the non-T when both are subject to the same light load?
 Is this understanding correct, or am I missing anything?
 I&#x27;m asking here as there&#x27;s plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.
 Any advice or insights is really appreciated.
 Thank you very much! 😊

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out an easy (and safe) way to connect to my home servers while I&#x27;m at traveling or at work. I have a handful of local servers, but the only internet facing boxes are the Jellyfin server and Minecraft server. The others (Home Assistant, proxmox, etc.) I am not quite comfortable port forwarding to the open web for security reasons.
 That being said, I would really like to be able to access some of these things from outside of my home network, and I would like to be able to do so safely.
 Obviously RDP is off the table, and I was cautioned against using VNC for similar reasons. My question for everybody: how are you all connecting to your home servers? It&#x27;s probably something simple I&#x27;m overlooking, but it would be so nice to use!

 I tried adding &quot;resolvectl domain %i internal.example.com&quot; to the end of the postup config. But the docker container doesn&#x27;t contain resolvectl so it fails
 I&#x27;ve tried editing the search domains of the host, which does pass to the container, no luck
 I&#x27;ve tried mounting a custom resolv.conf into the container, no luck
 There has got to be a way!

I see some people get more than 1 router to have muliable lans but you can do such with a switch or just 1 router.

                              <span>I setup a Dell PowerEdge R510 server with Hyper-V 2016 on bare metal headless install years ago. It has treated me great and I have no issues *that I know of*...
 I have 10 older hard drives (that I bought used) installed in RAID 6 for non-important data, and then 2 newer hard drives in RAID 1. Being a R510 everything is older inside including the RAID card and iDRAC.
 When I try to access the iDRAC via old IE, Chrome, or FF I get: ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH 
 I think the iDRAC is too old? I don&#x27;t know the version/model off hand, I don&#x27;t have a need to reboot it to get that info at this point. When I did the install I was able to get into the iDRAC but didn&#x27;t find it useful or prob more honestly didn&#x27;t know how to use it... But now I can&#x27;t get in without full blown troubleshooting and downtime.
 Is there any way to monitor OS health/stats, HDD health, and maybe even get alerts/emails when things change if the iDRAC is dead/old?

 I&#x27;ve set up the server.yaml with the base_url and behind_proxy.. i&#x27;m obviously missing something from the NPM config.. but i&#x27;m just not sure which bits from the documentation i need.
 I&#x27;m running NTFY using the ubuntu repo and have it running on port 82.

It doesn&#x27;t have a simple docker setup like Amazon has but it has ssh access. So I feel like it should be possible. All the instructions I find are how to do it on your local machine, which isn&#x27;t what I want to do. 
 Is there a simple guide to getting docker up and running on a server?

But I dont really know if I can trust the source of the app. I figure it cant hurt to try it out, but I&#x27;d like to be able to monitor the server for a while and make sure its not trying to phone home, or make any other odd network connections. 
 I have looked into Wireshark, but it is very overwhelming, and even after watching some guides Im not confident in my ability to set it up to watch for the right stuff.

                              <span>Hi All.
 I&#x27;ve set up Cloudflare to expose some self hosted apps to the web. I&#x27;ve used the Windows tutorials for setting up a tunnel (here) and installing as a windows service (here). 
 However, I&#x27;m having two problems:
 1) The tunnel doesn&#x27;t seem to automatically re-establish after a reboot, but I thought that was the whole point of installing as a service? I need to manually start the tunnel every time
 2) When I manually start the tunnel in powershell, it seems to hang after: 
 2022-09-29T17:27:03Z INF Starting metrics server on 127.0.0.1:51247/metrics 2022-09-29T17:27:03Z INF Connection 7f227281-c6e6-4293-b844-ba1a77477c9c registered connIndex&#x3D;0 ip&#x3D;198.41.200.233 location&#x3D;MAN 2022-09-29T17:27:04Z INF Connection 95624ee5-9a2e-4562-b503-369ddc82b4cc registered connIndex&#x3D;1 ip&#x3D;198.41.192.57 location&#x3D;LHR 2022-09-29T17:27:05Z INF Connection 3417ba7f-6047-444f-9c9d-b185b27f3d18 registered connIndex&#x3D;2 ip&#x3D;198.41.200.13 location&#x3D;MAN 2022-09-29T17:27:06Z INF Connection 2542ce0f-aca3-4e59-80d0-44f899e539ca registered connIndex&#x3D;3 ip&#x3D;198.41.192.227 location&#x3D;LHR 
 i.e. I don&#x27;t get a command prompt back. A quick look at the cloudlfare log shows this error every 12 seconds or so:
 {&quot;level&quot;:&quot;error&quot;,&quot;ip&quot;:&quot;198.41.200.73&quot;,&quot;connIndex&quot;:0,&quot;error&quot;:&quot;Unauthorized: Failed to get tunnel&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2022-09-29T17:40:11Z&quot;,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Register tunnel error from server side&quot;} 
 Wondering if anyone has come across this before, and maybe knows of a fix? My Googleing didn&#x27;t find any solutions.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done plenty of research and didn&#x27;t find anything like that working on Linux, the most promising would seem:
 Manage engine - Looks great but only working on windows (apparently there&#x27;s a free cloud-version too for now), a solution for self hosting on Linux would be running a VM with windows and installing it there, i don&#x27;t know if a poor raspberry 4 could handle that tho
 Spiceworks.com - Only for windows and no future development for Linux in their program
 There&#x27;s also Flyve but looks like it&#x27;s kind of abandoned, little to no documentation available and installing seems quite challenging.
 I&#x27;m searching for something i can self host on a rapsberry pi and access over my network, would be great with a dashboard on apache.
 But i&#x27;m open to other variables

                              <span>Hello,
 since the first version of paperless-ngx I use - 1.9.0 and today 1.9.2, I have a problem,
 that processing some files of the queue starts but never ends.
 Instead I can see in the Docker Logs teh following: 
 16:21:02 [Q] INFO Process-1:4 processing [file.pdf]
 [2022-09-29 16:21:04,113] [INFO] [paperless.consumer] Consuming file.pdf
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Enqueued 1
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Process-1 created a task from schedule [Check all e-mail accounts]
 16:24:09 [Q] ERROR reincarnated worker Process-1:4 after death
 ​
 I am not sure, where the problem could be, has anyone experienced similar issues?
 Appearently, I cannot share this exact file, but If you&#x27;d like to try on your instance, I have a Datasheet as PDF which does not get consumed either.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I created a webapp to store coupons, discounts and loyalty cards. Several barcodes are supported. It helps me to get rid of a couple of physical loyalty cards in my wallet, as I can scan the barcodes on the phone.
 The app is self-hostable and open source. Feedback is very welcome: https://github.com/metikular/coupon-store

                              <span>Hey reddit!
 Just a refresher: Last week I announced Fasten, a self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 1000&#x27;s of insurances/hospitals/clinics 
 Here&#x27;s a couple of screenshots that&#x27;ll remind you what it looks like:
 Fasten Screenshots 
  
Your interest in Fasten was overwhelmingly positive, and its obvious this is worth pursuing further!
 I&#x27;m happy to announce that I have a &quot;Beta&quot; version that&#x27;s available for testing.
 Having said that, there are some limitations to this Beta
  
You can only connect to Sandbox accounts on the healthcare providers (no real/personal accounts yet).
 It&#x27;s only packaged as a Docker image
 Search is disabled
 There&#x27;s no background processing, so healthcare provider access tokens will expire (and need reconnect…</span>

 For example, I have a &#x27;Christmas&#x27; directory of mp3s. I&#x27;d like to create a &#x27;Christmas Channel&#x27; that randomly plays one of those to any client listening. (it doesn&#x27;t have to be directory based, using tags or database or whatever would work too). Same for a &#x27;Hard Rock&#x27; directory or such. 
 Or even having a static playlist would work, as long as it&#x27;s saved server side and all clients can access it.
 
 Ideally I&#x27;d also like an android app/client - but having a good mobile webpage would also work.

                              <span>Finally I decided to dump over 5k photos out of my memory card in my digital camera and try to organize them with some self hosted service. I rearranged them to a year-month folder structure using local tools (exiftool) and upload them to my server. I also have two rolls of scanned films without proper EXIF info, which are placed in dedicated folders.
 I give both LibrePhotos and PhotoPrism a quick test since they don&#x27;t touch the structure of original files so I can run them both at the same time.
 Unique LibrePhotos Feature I like: Auto event albums. Super convenient as it basically just needs timestamp. I mainly use my dc to record my dates and LibrePhotos successfully identified most of them. 
 PhotoPrism has Moments but it seems to have more strict rules. PhotoPrism only identified 3 m…</span>

                              <span>This is a hardware-related self hosting question -- hopefully that is okay. :)
 So, I have an old HP inkjet/scanner combo I&#x27;ve been using forever, to scan full sheets. It does great work but it&#x27;s been making odd noises lately and I know it won&#x27;t last forever.
 I&#x27;d like to use something to scan things like invoices and receipts, doing so under Unix/Linux.
 Bonus points if I can do the scanning on the command line -- my current solution I have to use X windows and a graphical tool to capture the image(s).
 I&#x27;m using a self-authored tool with this stuff to manage finances. Right now I just used it for full invoices, as the scan takes a long time. But I&#x27;m hoping to track individual receipts in an integrated manner. (I&#x27;d be willing to release part/all of this tool once I get this integration going, it needs some tuning and updating to be fully not-just-me ready).
 Suggestions or helpful advice appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Hoping someone can help out. I have a docker server on windows 11 and I am having issues with WSL randomly crashing or something and losing access to my containers. They are all behind a reverse proxy using a cloudflare tunnel. Anytime it happens all I have to do is run wsl —shutdown from a command prompt and I regain access. But then after a random amount of time it seems I can’t access them and I get the cloudflare error page. I can’t access them locally either with my ip. None of the containers go down and I don’t even know where to look for logs to see if anything is erroring within the kernel. I have tried reinstalling docker and removing wsl feature from windows and re enabling and it still does it. I’ve also looked at the GitHub for wsl and it seems maybe others are having this issue but I can’t find a fix that works for me.

                              <span>Going through the process of building and obviously have my homelab in the forefront of my mind. I ran several ethernet runs in my current home for ubiquiti access points and cameras, as well as a few to our office + family room /tv area. I’m incredibly stoked to be able to run cable without having to crawl in the attic. 
 Any big tips or things to be mindful of while I have access to the wall cavities?
 So many posts suggest running 3-4 cables per room, is it really necessary?
 My lab:
 • Ubiquiti UDM Pro
 • Ubiquiti 16 Poe switch
 • Ubiquiti 10gb aggregation switch
 • Unraid box (super micro 36 bay)
 • Truenas box (also super micro 36 bay)
 • UPS

                              <span>I hope this isn&#x27;t against the rules, and I am not soliciting... but I am looking for advice on how/where to post a job opening.
 I&#x27;m looking for someone to manage a 75 node network that supports a staff of 15. It&#x27;s got everything from Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, ESXi, Proxmox, Docker, Ubiquiti, MySQL, and Synology, and in-house built apps. Most of the hardware consists of custom build workstations and servers. We have very little that runs in the Cloud. 
 I&#x27;ve been a longtime lurker in /r/homelab. I built most of this myself and many of the ideas have come from this group. I&#x27;m just at the point now where I need someone to take it over full time. 
 The whole lab is accessed remotely by the staff and I need someone who can be there hands on to manage and document it all. Make sure things are backed up, fix/repair broken hardware, do reboots, upgrade/build new workstations as things age, install new software and keep things patched/secure and running. They also need to be organized enough to manage a large volume of data coming in and out of the office on a weekly basis.
 I&#x27;ve posted variations of this to a bunch of job sites and have gotten over 100 resumes to sift through. After a dozen phone screens, no one is coming even close. 
 Most resumes are from people who are Tier 1 Helpdesk who do password resets, break fix, and some basic administration; but no one has ever installed anything from scratch. Only 1-2 people have ever built their own computer or know much about hardware, and no one seems to have any experience in Linux or Docker. Not a single resume has highlighted any Homelab experience.
 So, my question is:
 Where do you people look for jobs? Am I asking for too much? Is the job not attractive because it&#x27;s not Cloud based? Could there be something horribly wrong with my job description?
 Any advice that can point me in the right direction would be appreciated.

They both individually work when inserted in the network, but when they are both are next to each other in the network, there is no connection between them, even with both in un-mannaged mode.
 I&#x27;m wanting the prosafe+ next to the ISP drop, and the power connect lab side. Anyone got any ideas i can try, to figure out what&#x27;s happening?

                              <span>I have a powerful host with huge cpu/memory. I would like to run different types of VM on top of it. So I can switch environment conveniently for different purposes(dev zone, windows VM, side project, etc).
 I currently create a virtual bridge on bare metal host. The KVM VM connects to this bridge to get same IP range as bare metal host.
 Things overall look good but I occasionally run into weird issue such as not able to ssh to VM from outside world. Wondering whether my homelab&#x27;s overall design is correct.

                              <span>At one time, you could just startup an SMTP server and have at it.
 Nowadays though there&#x27;s (obvious) reasons to not allow just anyone to stick an SMTP server on the Internet, even if it&#x27;s a send-only server and it&#x27;s behind a firewall so nobody ever connects to it but you. While you can do this, pretty much any legitimate E-mail service out there will immediately flag anything you try sending as spam, or outright refuse to accept your messages in the first place.
 There&#x27;s a lot of reasons you might want to be able to deliver arbitrary E-mails - not just to yourself, but to others, possibly across disparate E-mail domains. The vast majority of such messages need not ever be replied to, so even the E-mail address they come from is not necessarily that important, other than that it should be able to be identified by the recipient.
 Are there services out there that are generally trusted to be able to do this, even if for a modest cost? Basically I want to be able to have a reliable way to send both myself and others who are relevant various alerts and messages.
 Examples:
  
I want errors found on ZFS with zed to go to me and a friend,
 I want to design an app that can E-mail a small number of people when I post new content on my Jellyfin server
 I want to have a script send a daily report of some server stats to me.
 I want to have a Web app where a person with an account in my system can submit some kind of job, and when the job has finished an E-mail is sent to the account&#x27;s stored E-mail address with the results of the job.
  
I know that if I were to just, say, create a Gmail account for the purpose, I could configure my apps to connect to Gmail&#x27;s SMTP and deliver that way, but I&#x27;m not sure Google even allows this type of use in the TOS, and even if that&#x27;s not a concern, it&#x27;s likely not going to make you look very good when all your E-mail account is doing is sending out obviously auto-generated E-mails on a regular basis.
 How do you guys handle this?

                              <span>I have been tinkering with hardware quite a bit – but some things remain mysteries to me and I finally dare to ask those questions in public. Been trying to read up on them online, but some information is scattered and inconsistent.
  
Are SAS hard drives worth it? From what I know internally they&#x27;re the same as SATA drives and have a physical limit at around ~200 MB/s throughput.
 Why specify SAS&#x27; hard drive connections as 6G/12G if throughput is limited to ~200 MB/s anyways?
 SFF-8087 and SFF-8643 are apparently the same electronically, just another physical connector. Is there any difference and can I just use adapters to go from one to the other without performance loss?
 Is there any real world difference between SAS2 6G and SAS3 12G backplanes? From what I understand each SFF-8xxx cable running to the backplane will get one dedicated 6G/12G connection. So serving four drives each that would mean 1,5 Gbps throughput per drive when working with SAS2 6G, right?
 Aren&#x27;t HBAs limited to 6G anyways? So why even bother with 12G backplanes?
 How do SAS expanders work and what&#x27;s the performance? This Dell SAS expander seems to expand to 24 drives and connects to another server for JBOD via a single SFF-8088. Do I get 6G/12G for all 24 drives or what&#x27;s the best way to connect a full array of hard drives without sacrificing performance?
 How do top loaders like 45Drives or Supermicro&#x27;s 90 drive top loader serve all of the disks? Do they just have 22 HBAs? How do they ensure full performance?
 I assume SAS3 12G is relevant for faster flash storage – but why is it still relevant when everyone talking about NVMes for best performance nowadays?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a little homelab, which I diagrammed the relevant part here https://i.imgur.com/2dtMFXK.png
 Basically I have an ESXI on my server, which hosts a Linux VM with an Apache web server. I can access my Apache without any problem, the problem begins when I want to access my ESXI web interface from the outside. ESXI has its own web server, but my router/firewall is configured to send incoming 80 and 443 to my Apache IP.
 I&#x27;m not sure of what would be the way to direct for instance esxi.mydomain.com to the ESXI web server. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I live in the middle of nowhere, only place I can post ads that I know of are facebook marketplace, but there&#x27;s very few people that would be interested in homelab gears.
 I got stuff like an UDM-Pro brand new still in the sealed box, or a used mikrotik switch, that I want to sell, but I don&#x27;t have an ebay account, and I&#x27;m a bit worried about selling on ebay since their policy tends to overly favor the buyer. 
 Thanks for any advices!

 I need a home firewall to protect my children. I believe my old HP Z400 desktop can serve this function. I would appreciate any recommendations for free firewall software that I can put on it.
 Thanks.

 A good notes app with the ability to schedule notes for a particular day and simple checklist support.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently hosting nextcloud and vaultwarden on my raspi 4 4GB which I overclocked to 2 GHz. I recently bought a Fujitsu S740 ThinClient with an Intel J4150 and 8 GB ram. I additionally want to host bookstack wiki, an email server, a Minecraft server and maybe some other stuff to experiment with. 
 How do I choose where to host which services so I use my resources as efficiently as possible?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can&#x27;t figure this problem out.
 So I want to use NginxProxyManager but don&#x27;t want it publicly accessible. I read I should only access it on localhost then, after connecting to the server via Wireguard, but it isn&#x27;t working for me.
 My Docker configuration for Wireguard is this, for NginxProxyManager it&#x27;s this, and my firewall looks like this.
 After deploying Wireguard, I copied the peer config and loaded it into the Wireguard app on my computer without issue.
 But when I connect to it, I can&#x27;t search on Google, or even access the port 81 that I wanted to (http://localhost:81) in the first place.
 I even tried curl-ing the address. On my server it&#x27;s fine and I get a response, but when I do it from my computer it just says &#x27;connection refused&#x27;.
 Anyone have any hints or ideas on how to fix this?
 I tried adding my IP to my firewall with sudo ufw allow proto tcp from my-ip to 80,443 or something, but it didn&#x27;t work. I also tried disabling my firewall and then accessing http://localhost:81 on my computer, but that was unsuccessful too.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m actually searching for the fastest media server solution.I&#x27;m currently running plex on my home server, and it works fine.Tho I have a backup with all my media on the cloud and I would like to make it as fast as possible.I tried:- plex, cool but slow if used on web- jellyfish good but still a little bit slow- emby wich for now is what I&#x27;m sticking to.
 Everything works with medias from a rclone mounted drive, network speed is not a problem so... what would you suggest?
 EDIT:
 Compromising on some features is not a problem, I just want the fastest way possible

                              <span>Hi everyone! Just shipped a product called Gardens: https://joingardens.com/apps. 📷
 PaaS (platform-as-a-service) refers to a model where the service helps you provision and run a platform for hosting apps and/or apps themselves without the hassle usually associated with it.
 New PaaS solutions show up pretty often, but they&#x27;re either proprietary, lock you in, or aren&#x27;t friendly for non-developers.Gardens solves all of that. Here&#x27;s what it does:
  - Makes setting up your own PaaS with an admin panel and setting up apps easy as cake. You don&#x27;t need to know how to code; there&#x27;s a library of 130+ apps available. They&#x27;re set up in one click
  - Does not lock you in. Your data as well as the PaaS application itself (Caprover) stays in your cloud. We support DigitalOcean but will add more providers soon
 - Has social features. While the whole self-hosting infra stays on your cloud, the main site features step-by-step guides and posts from big open-source companies to help find and share knowledge
 Curious to hear what the community here thinks! Gardens is open-source on Github, and accepting feature requests. Hope you&#x27;ll like it!

 And by txt2img I would expect you feed our an image and it tells you in text what it sees and where.
 As for txt2txt you would feed it a book, chapter, paragraph or sentence and it gives you a single word, sentence or résumé paragraph about the text. 
 Maybe you could zoom out of the whole text and apply these résumé as large colored transparent text overlay over the relevant pages so you can get a bird&#x27;s eye view of an entire text and be able to drill down on areas of interest.
 I&#x27;ve seen the Reddit news article summary bot so I know this exists in some capacity. I&#x27;m just hoping to find a self hosted, generalized version of this ?

 Is anyone aware of an self hosted Hazel alternative. Preferably on Docker, but I don&#x27;t mind installing it on a separate VM.
 Thanks so much!

It&#x27;s pretty sweet, but nobody has made a self-hosted gallery for the images and their prompts/settings... Yet plenty of online options exist.. https://lexica.art/, https://www.krea.ai/, etc
 What a conundrum! Who wants to be cool and be the first?

Do they open the SSO login in a browser ? Do they work at all if the service is behind SSO.
 The apps could be nextcloud, navidrome, jellyfin, immich etc.
 (Note: I am using SSO as a blanket term for user authentication)

 I&#x27;ve got some resource hungry containers that I do NOT need running all the time. Is there a means to launch docker containers on demand outside of launching portainer or some such, ideally via a web interface or link. My infrastructure is NOT hosted on the internet, so security is of slightly-less concern. Just curious if it is possible more than anything.
 Or, can I somehow pass a command via a web interface/button to portainer to start/stop a specific container?

                              <span>Hi there,
 ​
 For a while I&#x27;m using photo view https://github.com/photoview/photoview and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this gallery, but sometimes I want delete or move an Album, and I need to use (https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) for move or change file names or Album names or Albums directory. 
 ​
 Can you advise me some software with similar structure like photo view( I mean structure and gallery and album structure also, I don&#x27;t need face recognition) ?

                              <span>Hi All,
 As the title suggests, I&#x27;m looking for an alternative for Nginx Proxy Manager. My reasoning for this is I&#x27;ve been using Nginx Proxy Manager for the last 6 months or so, and in that time, I&#x27;ve had multiple instances of it just.. Failing outright. The docker container will be running, but traffic will not flow whatsoever. I&#x27;ve also had issues with SSL certs not renewing, as well as not issuing. I can&#x27;t keep having my services go down and reverting backups on the main server, rebuilding the container, or having to roll back updates/push new updates constantly to try and fix the problem.
 Recently, I had it fail again, and am unable to get it working whatsoever. I switched back to good old Nginx basic, writing the configs manually and setting it up, and it works fine.
 I&#x27;m looking for an alternative with a GUI. I don&#x27;t want to go back to command line and writing configs manually. I&#x27;m just too tired of having to pray that Nginx Proxy Manager will work, or having to roll back to get it working again.
 Please suggest some alternatives with a GUI and ideally docker based as I&#x27;m running this on a Windows machine.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I came across this subreddit and asked myself the following question. Suppose you want to host e.g. a Nextcloud, Bitwarden, etc. on your own server but have no idea about setting up the infrastructure. Is there a tool (or even a paid service) with which you can deploy the application (+ web server and so on) on your host with just a few clicks without necessarily depending on a provider? All this without additional software and via a frontend that guides me through the necessary steps?
 ​
 I am well aware that you have to take care of the connection from the tool to my host for example. My question is only aimed at the pure deployment or setup of the application.
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

 but i want to mess with self hosted password managers and 2FA for all of my services as well and both of these require https (so SSL) 
 so is there a way to set custom domains on my local network ( which i have done once through adguardhome) and then getting SSL certs for those domains ?? 
 Thanks for any help :)

                              <span>Hello r/selfhosted community!
 For the context, in case you have seen it before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers. The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users&#x27; contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What&#x27;s new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.

                              <span>Hi guys.
 Currently Iran is blocking the internet mostly, and are trying to do what north korea and china do with their &quot;internet&quot;
 Almost no vpn works, only tor with snowflake connects which is so slow you can only send a text every 30seconds.
 Right now the only thing that I think is working properly are proxies, I don&#x27;t know much about proxies but some mtproto and socks5 proxies are working on my telegram (they get blocked after a while but we&#x27;ll use a new one)
 Can you guys provide some guides on how to use proxies for my whole linux and android device, and provide a list of proxies?
 Also a huge thanks to everyone who is sending us their help and prayers.

                              <span>I live somewhere with very restrictive internet censorship. Google DNS, Cloudflare and other well known dns providers are blocked and DNS requests are forwarded to a government resolver no matter what you set on your device. DoH (such as dns.google) doesn&#x27;t work at all. 
 Is there an easy, noob-friendly way i can host my own dns on a vps overseas?

I was wondering how one would go about downloading a live feed from the site that are just a static image that refreshes every 3 seconds? An example of a stream: http://221.189.0.181/cgi-bin/guestimage.html. 
 I&#x27;ve tried Jdownloader2 but it only grabs the current image that is up. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll need something that refreshes or waits and pulls again? Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hello
 I want to build my own server, and I want to build de pc myself
 The use is going to be: 
 1) Automate media gathering: Radarr + sonarr + prowlarr + notifiarr + maybe 2 or 3 more *arrs. + Qbittorrent 
 2) Plex media server with tone mapping (normally for one user. Maximum 2 users at the same time) I need it to be running in Linux or Docker for compatibility (https://support.plex.tv/articles/hdr-to-sdr-tone-mapping/) as I need the tone mapping to be done with hardware and not software 
 3) Home assistant server 
 4) Backup server
 Could you advice me??
 Thank you!

                              <span>Right now I do my cloud backup to Google Drive Enterprise or whatever it is called these days, and while it works, it has some significant drawbacks. Mainly, it is limited to 750GB upload per day and could go away or not become unlimited at any time. I would like to switch to something more stable where it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m just freeloading off of an accounting oversight.
 Given the similar nature of most hoards (ripped blu-rays, youtube archives, linux ISOs, etc), it seems like there should be a way to share backup of a given collection with others, deduplicating and splitting the cost in the process. With B2 and Cloudflare for example, you could do this very cheaply.
 Does any such thing exist? Would you use it if it did?

                              <span>Hello, 
 Just a question.
 For the past few years while I was studying at the art academy I&#x27;ve been hoarding stuff from public computers people kept around. Best example: we had a scanner classroom with a dozen different scanners for digitalizing film photography and such. People often didn&#x27;t delete the stuff from the computers after they were done and I collected them. 
 Now I want to start an art project with all these collected files, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is allowed. I know from some of them who it was, but most of the time people didn&#x27;t really add names to their files. I probably can ask the ones that did add their name for permission. But is that even necessary?
 It was stored on public computers, there were no rules about the usage of it all. 
 I also recall artist Sherrie Levine who blatantly copied work of great artists such as Evan Walker, Edgar Degas and Marcel Duchamp. Without asking their permission of course. 
 This might be the wrong sub to ask this, but someone might be able to help me out here.

Are there any working tiktok scrapers which you have found or created? I have tried few which didn&#x27;t work. I know tiktok is a big firm and they have made scraping difficult but are there any tools which work?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I need some advice on where to go in my data hoarding/collecting. I currently have a DS214 that I&#x27;ve outgrown with 2 10tb drives in SHR-1 (RAID1). My main use for it is storing photos and videos for my photography work. I&#x27;m not accessing the data all the time but typically 1-2 days a week locally only. I&#x27;d like to eventually scale this more to increase storage and have a better 3-2-1 plan since, obviously, RAID isn&#x27;t backup. I&#x27;m thinking of using B2 eventually, but I need to solve the local issue first. I have an older (2014 era) custom PC that I can repurpose but am not sure what direction to move in. I would like a better and faster workflow for accessing my photos and I’m working mainly from my Mac currently via the DS214.

                              <span>I am open to Linux or Windows. I have DVD ISOs of TV shows and want to extract episodes as separate mp4 files and of course transcode to them. I don&#x27;t expect the tool to give me reasonable file names or episode names but if it did that would be super cool.
 Aiseesoft used to have a dvd ripper program that seemed to work ok but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be on their current product list and their new products seem crazy and complicated.

                              <span>Hi. Below are two links to a retailer in my country that sells two IronWolf drives. I&#x27;m a little confused, though. What&#x27;s the actual difference between the drives? They have the same name, but the price is different (though the actual difference is negligible - only about the equivalent of 4-5 USD). One has higher RPM but lower read and write speed, plus smaller cache. The other drive is the opposite - lower RPM with higher read and write speed and bigger cache. Also, the first drive is a little heavier. Does anybody know what&#x27;s up with that?
 Drive 1: here 
 Drive 2: here

 I&#x27;ve heard there is a way to get Dropbox Business Advanced for a bit cheaper. Who can help me with this? I do like to get the plan, but 3 users is too much for me and the price for the plan (when getting a license for 3 users) is too high compared to what Google offered with their Enterprise plan and my budget.
 Thanks!

                              <span>EDIT: [SOLVED, LEAVING UP FOR POSTERITY]
 Hi everyone. 
 Basically I would like to export every reddit comment that I have ever made.
 I have always wanted to write a book, and while most shit I have written on here is drivel, in the six years I&#x27;ve had this account (12 year vet of reddit here) I have experienced and written on the subjects of pandemia, the war in Ukraine, changing economic and social climate in Poland, France, and the United states, art, literature, music; you know, some occasionally good or interesting things.
 I also believe that the observer effect and known intent of wanting to write would, if I revisit these topics, strip away some of the eloquence, grandeur, or rawness from when I originally passionately wrote on these subjects in participation instead of intent to create a larger body of work. 
 So, I would like to export my reddit comments into .txt or something (is epub easy to set up I&#x27;ve no experience with this format but I suspect it would open up some tools to me, please correct me if I am out of date, I deal more in audio and graphics.)
 So, if anyone has any advice, I had performed my due diligence and tried to find things on my own, but so far I haven&#x27;t turned up anything due to build in limits to reddit that only catalogue the last 1k comments.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Hi guys I just bought Godzilla (2014) on blu ray and ripped it using makemkv. The thing is that the file was 27GB and I thought it should be more, so when I played the movie in VLC it didn&#x27;t look as detailed as it should. I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, I would like you to help me with that with some advice. My only goal is to have a remux file of the movie.
 PS: I leave you an image of the drive with I used
 PS 2: I have two screenshots, as you can see in the 3D Bluray version Godzilla&#x27;s scales are very clear but not in the standard Bluray version. The same goes for other scenes where in the Bluray 3D version everything is more detailed. https://imgur.com/a/Z5hUjbU

 Would there be any other way or fix that&#x27;ll allow me to view these videos through the Wayback Machine? Please and thank you

 Here&#x27;s just one of the links I tried but wouldn&#x27;t load the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5pcpzkl_9eI

                              <span>I am managing folder structures for our team&#x27;s information. It&#x27;s in sharepoint, but practically-speaking, everyone accesses it by syncing to OneDrive and navigating through File Explorer. 
 I am constantly getting suggestions to deepen folder structures, to provide more organisation. I want to better understand the pros and cons of this. I would like to say No, because I think users will have more clicking, not necessarily guaranteeing the data hoard is properly filed. But that just sounds like a negative Nancy / pessimistic response.
 Advice?

                              <span>I’m very uninformed and uneducated on this subject, please bear with me.
 When I search for what HDD should I buy, results mostly said I should buy cheap one, but multiple.
 They also talked about bytes per dollar rule and something but, I honestly forgot.
 So…I’m here to asking direct help, again.
 I’m planning to get Terra Master D5-300C DAS, and I use it for storing huge video and image files. Nothing crazy, casual use, I think. Don’t sure if it’s helpful for you to give me advice.

                              <span>I have been using RaiDrive 2020.6.80 (I use this old version because new ones require payment for the shared drives connection) to connect my main Google Drive enterprise, and also my shared drives. Today, the shared drives do not connect, and it just tells me: Delegation aborted Reason: () GoogleTeamDrive: https://lambda.raidrive.com/v1.1/cloud/GoogleTeamDrive/access_token -&gt;(BadRequest)
 My main enterprise drive still works. But the shared drives not. Also heard from my two people I have given access to shared drives, and set up the same RaiDrive system.
 Anyone else noticed? Could they have “fixed” their loophole of using an old version? Or maybe just a temporary glitch?…
 EDIT: Well for now I switched to using the Google Drive client on those machines aswell. But shame if RaiDrive stopped working.

I am looking for the best way to accomplish this goal. Can you advice me on which data storage should I choose for this task? Right now I am planning on using Google Drive, but there are propably better options.

Google of goharddrive code gets plenty of hits from weird sites, but nothing works. I have signed up for email, and this isn&#x27;t something I need to do asap, but no need to wait if they are never going to show up. 
 Anybody know for sure? What I have read a few places is that you get a code for first purchase.

Given up on trying to find anything that has the LAN’s on the front, and also has to be available in Australia. Any recommendations?

                              <span>I’m in the process of upcycling some of my old hardware into a basic server (NAS and some very lightweight VMs) but I have an issue ; I only have one PCIe x16 slot, and only 2x SATA III ports, and 2x SATA II. I’m using an SSD for a boot drive and I have 3x 6TB drives. Is it more worth it to add more SATA ports with the PCIe slot and an expansion card or do I use the slot for a low/mid-tier GPU I have (1060 3gb)? Not sure what would be more worth it. I would be using the GPU mainly for accelerated transcoding, but idk if it’s worth sacrificing the SATA speed on 2 of my hard drives.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been reading up on various file server options and would really appreciate the sub&#x27;s input.
 Current setup: Three-node Proxmox HA cluster. TrueNAS Core running virtualized on one Proxmox node with local HBA and disks passed through. Total file storage is only around 5TB.
 Problem: TrueNAS Core is overkill for my current needs. The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can&#x27;t take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.
 I&#x27;d like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I&#x27;m looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn&#x27;t support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data. I&#x27;ve looked at openmediavault, Unraid, Ubuntu server, and stripped-down TrueNAS with a virtualized disk - but can&#x27;t figure out which path to pursue. 
 Hoping someone has been down a similar road and can offer advice. Thanks!

 tldr at the bottom. 
 Long time lurker here. I was dreaming about a homelab for some time and a few months ago I made the first baby step and bought a Synology DS920+ to have a NAS in general and have a place where I can play around a bit with docker containers to see whether I really like this hobby or not.
 I spent at least a dozen night since having the NAS playing around with my home sandbox to say the least and really like the whole host things for yourself and build a mini &quot;empire&quot; locally. Anyway a long lost child is on the surface again and I enjoy it.
 So the other day an electrician were over to do some job here and he is a very cool guy and we have talked a lot about homelab stuff and he said that he has some old servers which he just happened to have because he l…</span>

                              <span>I posted this in r/WireGuard as well, but since r/homelab has a larger membership, I thought I&#x27;d see if any of you had any ideas.....
 Ok, so, I have a number of issues trying to keep things running on my external access to my hosted services in my home. All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I&#x27;ve been doing this for YEARS, but I&#x27;ve been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. 
 All that to ask this....I&#x27;ve been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.
 I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.
 That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I&#x27;ll just use my existing configs for it, but what I&#x27;m NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it&#x27;s just using OpenVPN, but I&#x27;m not sure).
 Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?
 Ultimately, I&#x27;d like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don&#x27;t limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode&#x27;s IP my public IP.
 Although, now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).
 Am I making this too complicated? LOL!
 Any help or thoughts would be appreciated.

 I am currently running a dell r720 with all 8 2&quot;5in drive bay filled. I have recently procured 8x 3&quot;5in 4TB SAS drives and was hoping I could get some ideas on how to connect them to the server as I would like to use them. I am using Truenas Scale if it helps. Thanks

                              <span>I could not figure out how to answer about the T620 Fan Gantry Question in a way it would let me post pictures. 
 I can confirm that the fan Gantry from a T630 / T640 can be adapted to the T620. I ordered the Gantry from eBay that was for a T630/T640 and I had the fans from a T620 (same fan type that is in the CPU Shroud Assembly) - The only thing I had to do is snip the small metal piece blocking the Fan connectors to go down.

 Use Tin Snips to cut that piece out and Use Needle Nose Pliers to bend the edges back down.

Since the manual is not helping much I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ve mounted them correctly. There is a gap in the front when sliding in the case cause of the way the rail is mounted, which does not allow me to fasten the case to the rack in the front, is this normal and secure or should I mount the rack rail further back(1st img)?
 Thanks!

I believe that the NUC will use around 45 watts~ but am not sure about the other build, I know it&#x27;s dependent on work load but any guess as to how much power it&#x27;ll use?
 Here&#x27;s what I do with Proxmox, at the moment:
  
5 out of the 20 VMs run most of the time, the remainders are just for testing, learning, etc. 
 I run a lot of containers, Linux OS&#x27;s and a couple of Windows OS&#x27;s 
 The containers are small, mostly web servers, the most intensive ones are TrueNAS and Emby
  
I will have to put a couple hundred into either build after I make the sale on the tower. Thoughts? Advise?

 Are there any other &#x27;fun&#x27; apps I can install/make use of?
 Very new to the Docker world so not sure what is currently out there

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I am looking for a solution to basically do a NMAP scan every 15-30 minutes on my network and either alert me of new devices or show me the new devices. Same as doing port and host monitoring. 
 Im not sure if librenms will do this for me but i can look into it. 
 Goal:
  
notification of new devices
 web ui
 port mapping
 latency testing
 non-credentialed scans/ credentialed scans
  
Any ideas would be great!

                              <span>Made this to get some inspiration (and hopefully help others in the same boat as me). 
 My current set up consists of a TrueNAS server with ~8TB usable storage and a Plex VM running inside of it, a Raspberry Pi with a VPN server and PiHole installed, and a Dell Optiplex micropc running Docker which currently has Zabbix and Portainer running on it - I definitely plan on upgrading soon, but as the title suggests, I’m looking for some ideas on what else I would like to run.
 Some ideas for the future: Graphana; some sort of camera managing software for a future security system (found an open source option which looks great but can’t remember the name off the top of my head) and a backup solution that would backup servers to TrueNAS.
 Anyway, what are you people in this subreddit running currently and is there anything you would suggest I take a look at?

                              <span>I am trying to figure out how to manage access for internal servers running various web apps. (It is important to note that neither these apps nor servers are exposed to the public Internet.) In the past, I have relied on unsigned certificates or even no certificates. However, I am starting to see apps that will not work in either of these configurations and web browsers that are becoming increasingly unhappy about unsigned certificates.
 I get that there are risks with unsigned certs, but these are tightly controlled apps inside my LAN and so I am less concerned. I am familiar with letsencrypt and use that for external facing apps. But all of these servers are internal only and so an external CA makes little sense.
 Any advice on how to handle this?
 TIA!

 I had the machine running pi-hole via docker, it broke a few times, I fixed it a few times, but I&#x27;m feeling more confident in my skills. I&#x27;ve been trying to get a vpn to go with it, but I&#x27;m running into issues. First I thought I would give mistborn a try and I ran into issues. Recently I&#x27;ve been messing with wirehole and opened an issue thread without any luck. Should I stop trying to use things in docker? Is there something different I should be doing? Any help is appreciated

                              <span>Hello all, I’m looking for an application (preferably docker) that is able to generate a task completion report in PDF format that can be sent to the user via SMTP or can be viewed via a web portal. 
 This app is to prevent any disputes between me and the users during project discussions and on-site communications (e.g. on what user has requested and how they want the task to be done, signed at the end of the day and a report is generated for recording purposes.)
 The report itself needs to have the following information: - Unique running numbers to keep track of the report, something similar to an invoice. - A table that allows me to input the tasks that has been completed. - A signature line for user to sign. - Date &amp; time of task completion in the report.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to self host a tailscale alternative.. (or similar).
 I&#x27;ve seen a lot of the recommendations but most of them need a fair bit of investment to get them working so i;d like to ask some advice as to which one to sink my time in to..
 What I have : 
  
A VPS with 3x vCPU Core, 25GB SSD RAID-10, 2GB RAM, 3000GB Traffic - 1Gbps Port,1 Dedicated IPv4 Address
 2 Proxmox hosts locally
  
What i&#x27;d like : 
 Edit : A web gui!! i need a web gui to administer things!
 A VPN that will allow me to connect in via the VPS (ideally) and access my entire local network. Routinely, i&#x27;d be taking down one of my proxmox hosts, so i&#x27;d like to host a subnet router or similar on each one so there are failovers should i take one down..
 the VPS should also be able to ping my entire local network (for uptime kuma)
 I&#x27;d also like another subnet router for another remote network on a different IP range..
 Tailscale does everything i want on the free tier.. except for having 3 ingress(?) points in to my home network... if i&#x27;m not using the correct terminology here or anything else is off.. please tell me..
 Edit : looking at the tailscale documentation they offer a beta feature at the business class level called &quot;subnet router failover&quot; this is pretty much exactly what i&#x27;m after.. but you know.. selfhosted and free :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for an app that would let me manage redirects for domains easily. Basically, something that just asks what the old URL and new URL are and what type of response code to issue. Anything out there that handles this?

 Do You thinks if I make a 4TB LXC Container with tnycore fileserver (samba ) and give it a Local IP , then Share it as a network NAS to my Dockers VM on the same Proxmox server is a Good idea ?

                              <span>Connections and connection groups disappear when added to a connection group but still exist somewhere behind the scenes. I made a connection group called “networking” under the Root folder but now anything that I add to the networking group just disappears. If I try to make another group under networking the same thing happens, it seems to add without error but then it is not there when I expand the networking group. If I try to make the group again it says the group already exists. 
 Any ideas of what to check? 
 Also does anyone link directly to guacamole sessions? Im hoping to integrate with zabbix using macros to link hosts to a guac connection such as https://guac.my.tld/#/client/{HOST.IP} but it seems like guac uses auto generated strings for the url. Anyone doing something similar?

                              <span>Initially when i started my project, i planned to make my setups secure. My threat-model is probably quite low, as i am the only one using it and don&#x27;t publicize anything.
 Despite that, i still wanted to opt for a secure setup balancing my technical knowledge and skills, and practical usage.
 Before i started this all, i read up on what other people did and my &#x27;conclusion&#x27; was &quot;yeah, i should do that too because that seems right&quot;. But lately i am pondering if i should.
 I&#x27;ve created a DMZ network and installed a Treafik Proxy server within it. This proxy will redirect request to the actual application. I&#x27;ve already setup my firewall rules (only allows 80/443, and proxy to my app), the application (on a different VLAN) and even secured the docker socket.
 My next step was to add MFA like A…</span>

 Something with a calendar for appointments and who has him what day?
 The ability to upload pictures would be great; something to hold pictures of health cards, passport, insurance info, etc.
 Any thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

 Pretty much as the title say, I&#x27;m curious if anybody is self-hosting this? 
 If so, have you followed the guide to open all the required ports
 Open TCP ports 80, 443, 33073, 10000 (Dashboard HTTP &amp; HTTPS, Management gRCP &amp; HTTP APIs, Signal gRPC API respectively) on your server. 
 Or have you found some way to chuck a proxy in front of it?
 Thanks

                              <span>&quot;On October 26, 2022, the cost for .info registrations and renewals with Google Domains will increase from $12 to $22 per year. You can minimize the impact of the price change by adding up to 9 additional years to your current registration at only $12 per year.&quot;
 That seems like a big jump in price. I&#x27;d like to keep my .info domain, so I&#x27;m just wondering if there is a better alternative to Google Domains.
 (This is for my self-hosted stuff.)

                              <span>Greetings, I am searching for some chat solution that can work with SIP.
 How I imagine that is that you have one client where you can chat and where you also have some kind of dial pad to do sip calls.
 Sofar I wasn&#x27;t really able to find something that would work like this and the closest thing I found was the old jitsi desktop client which has XMPP and SIP in one application. Which would be perfect if only it wasn&#x27;t EOL and buggy

Would it have been scraped in that time? To fix it, I needed to restart it, which wiped out the docker access logs, so I can&#x27;t read them.
 Nay help would be appreciated, because I&#x27;m freaking out.

                              <span>Hi Everyone👋 , I&#x27;m one of the developers of ILLA, and I&#x27;m here to introduce our product here. We have many new features gonna be released by the end of Sep. 
 Our team members came from early-stage TikTok &amp; Kuaishou. We realized one huge issue during developing those products, operation and marketing teams need a tool to monitor data. It&#x27;s a very tedious job for developers. Therefore, we decided to build a low-code open-source tool to solve this. Our team believes our product is easy like Minecraft, but we definitely have more possibilities. You can even customize your own &quot;block&quot; in our product and sell it in the marketplace. (The feature is coming soon)
 ILLA is an open source low-code platform to help you to build internal tools in minutes. Alternative to PowerApps, AppSmith, and Retool. Check out our website to know more about us.

                              <span>Hello guys, quick question:
 I also want to use my knowledge and server power for good things. Reading about the developments and the cencorship in iran is devastating, but I stumbled across this tweet and this repo by signal to help people in iran get the word out.
 For the signal proxy, they are using nginx and letsencrypt already and the ports 80 and 443. My current setup already involves an nginx proxy as well as a certbot, so how can I host this signal proxy in my infrastructure?
 Some docker and nginx wizards are needed and the help is very welcome! Thanks 
 Edit: This is a blog post about the situation by signal

This is probably me being bad at things because I&#x27;ve been spoiled by LSIO containers, but I ran into trouble installing both of the ones I was able to find: https://github.com/Zuluru/Zuluru3#launch-zuluru and https://github.com/harisjlatif/doubleheader. Anyone here use these or have a recommendation? Thanks!

                              <span>So i was wondering which would be the best, 
 - divide de external drive in 2 partitions, one NTFS and the other HFS or 
 - Make it Ex-fat, but it dosnt have the journaling feature, so i dont know if it would be less stable to crash my backups in the future 
 Obs: Fat-32 is not a possibility, since i have files larger then 4gb 
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>Hey guys, im new to data hoarding so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 Recently, i got a hdd and decided to compile all the digital family photos we have from the past like 15 years and organize them so my mother can view them (she loves family photos). How can i rename all the files based on date created? Theres about 2tb of pictures and i dont want to go into the properties of each individual one to get the date it was taken and then rename them lol. Is there a way to rename them en masse?
 Edit: i should say rename by date modified, as the dates created are all recent since they were just created on this hdd. Date modified seems to be the day the photo was taken.

                              <span>So, 
 I own a QNAP TS-453D with these inside: 
 - 2 x WD red plus 4TB (WD40EFZX) drives in RAID 1 (39-40°C) 
 - 2 x WD black 1TB WD10JPLX drives in RAID 1 (34-36°C) - using these just becase they&#x27;re standing and doing nothing for the moment. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m going remove the WD Blacks and put another two 8TB drives in RAID 1. I&#x27;m considering one of these CMR drives: 
 ​
 WD Red Plus WD80EFZZ - 5640 rpm - warranty 3 years - 25/30 dbA - 255 € 
 WD Red Pro WD8003FFBX - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 29/36 dbA - 277 € 
 Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 - 7200 rpm - warranty 3 years - 28/32 dbA - 219 € 
 Seagate IronWolf Pro ST8000NE001 - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 28/30 dbA - 265 € 
 ​
 I&#x27;m using the NAS for two things only: 
  
Plex/Emby server 
 
PC / phone backup 
 
 ​
 The transfer speed right now is ~110Mb/s (1 Gbit link), which is good enough for me. 
 ​
 The price difference right now is not a deciding factor for me at all. But what matters for me more is: 
  
silence 
 
temperature 
 
longevity 
 
 ​
 The PRO&#x27;s (WD &amp; SG) both have 5 years of warranty - but, from the specs it would seem that it comes at the cost of drive noise (&amp; higher operating temperatures). 
 ​
 Any suggestions for my situation? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d like to have a quiet (and not to warm) NAS that will be reliable for some time.

                              <span>I’ve been paying $60 for 1TB of Amazon Drive cloud storage to save mainly photos and videos totaling about 500GB.
 And having Amazon Photos is a nice since it easier to view photos there than on Drive.
 But Drive is shutting down and Photos by itself is no good because the one feature I need to have is the ability to bulk download in the event the service shuts down. I love that Drive has it.
 Does anyone know of any good alternatives that makes it convenient to bulk download in case of an emergency?

                              <span>Hello, I have found myself in a position where I need to archive several terabytes of data for long term storage and have begun to seek out an external LTO-5 tape drive since I read this was the start of encryption for LTO tapes as well and I feel encryption is important for the data.
 I really only have a modern windows 11 machine however, and my PCIe x8 slot is blocked by my GPU. I would really prefer not having to find a workaround for this.
 My question is, do PCIe x4 SAS HBA cards with the external ports exist? The LTO-5 drive I am looking to buy is a dual SAS one, so I assume I need one that has 2 external ports? I think that&#x27;s the kind of card I need, anyway. I am novice.
 I&#x27;ve of course tried to search on my own, but it&#x27;s difficult for a newcomer with lots of unrelated results.
 Thank you for your consideration.

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m looking to have a big amount of data, and I wonder what is the best solution for my case
 I pretend to have a machine running 24/7 as media server, with radarr and sonarr. It will also serve as Plex media server. The las function it will have, is going to be a home assistant server.
 I wonder if it is a good idea to invest in a mini server, a good nas, or what I&#x27;m thinking, a nuc with a nas connected through usbC
 The nuc is a nuc11i3, and I think that the most basic nas would do the job, as I only need it as storage. I want to do this because I need to do tone mapping.
 What is your opinion /advice?

                              <span>Years back, I built myself a 50TB server with ZFS and 2 redundant disks. Massive storage beyond my imagination. Of course I have adopted the hoarding ways and now starting to feel the limits.
 I bought a motherboard with a decent number of SATA ports and expanded it with a SAS controller (seemed like a pretty niche piece of hardware!).
 What are my options for further expansion? I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.
 Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this? When I look it up I find a bunch of synology expansions arrays.
 Sorry if this is a silly question, I don&#x27;t exactly know what I should be searching :).

 Is this setup considered safe? How could I improve it.

                              <span>I have a r630 that I believed to have a bad motherboard. I then Purchased a r730xd and have the same exact issues. Ill run through my troubleshooting steps and maybe someone will see something Im missing.
 The issue is as follows, A1 and A3 show as bad memory channels.
  
swap A1 and A2, while swapping A3 and A4. still shows as bad memory in channels A1 and A3.
  
So this tells me that either the r630 motherboard or CPU1 is faulty. 
  
Swapped CPU1 and CPU2. Still shows as memory channels A1 and A3 are faulty.
  
So this tells me the motherboard is faulty.
  
Buy r730xd barebones and install my cpus, memory, hba, and nic. didn&#x27;t install in any order grabbed cpu and memory at random. Shows A1 and A3 faulty. repeated steps 1 and 2 with r730xd. Is it likely that I got 2 motherboards with faulty dimms slots/traced on the exact same dimms? I would lean to cpu but swapping them on both servers didnt move the error.

                              <span>So far my understanding is:
  
Pay for a line to be built (2mile road to nearest fiber conn) 
 
Continue paying for data which throttles at 150GB ($2/GB) 
 
Use my phone hotspot (which also throttles at 50GB) 
 
Rent office space? I can&#x27;t find any near me
 
 Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me. I start sweating when I see Slack or another JavaScript website download 20MB+. All those little things add up. Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. 
 I&#x27;ve considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I&#x27;m pretty sure cell towers are a bust. 
 The nearest library is nice but it&#x27;s only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. 
 Am I stuck with Starbucks? 
 I&#x27;m a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things. Anyone have any experience with rural internet conditions? How do you solve your data cap issues?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m upgrading my consumer level mobos to server grade and am looking for your experiences. I&#x27;m currently planning to get ASUS P12R-M/10G-2T for my pfSense router. Mainly due to that I&#x27;ve learned to trust Asus mobos, it&#x27;s got 2x Intel X710-AT2, ECC, IPMI, M.2 and is actually available. I&#x27;m likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I&#x27;m a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)
 - How&#x27;s the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I&#x27;m aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I&#x27;ll succeed with a 2U though.
 - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?
 - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense? I&#x27;ve got a separate 2x10GbE Intel PCIe NIC too.
 - Other gotchas that you wish you&#x27;d known before jumping to server boards?

                              <span>I am setting up a backup server and need some help dealing with the storage.
 Using XCP-NG as the hypervisor. I have 24TB of raw disks. I&#x27;d like to use this disk space mainly for the the backup, but would also like to have some space for other stuff.
 Should I:
  
Setup ZFS on XCP-ng and just give a large virtual disk to the backup VM?
 Setup ZFS on XCP-ng, and then create a NFS/iSCSI share to be mounted from the backup share?
 Setup TrueNAS and pass through the drives, then setup iSCSI or NFS for the connection to the backup VM
 Anything better that I might be missing?

 Found these m4 thumb screws on amazon for less than 10$ to space them out so heat will be dealt with better.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I have two APC R2000 Rack-Mount UPS&#x27;s for my HomeLab that appear to be completely dead. No output, no lit LED. Checked with known good batteries (from 3rd UPS). I&#x27;ve checked for (visibly) blown components, and confirmed that power makes it past the main circuit breaker.
 I&#x27;d like to find someone in the Boston/MA/US region that I can pay $$$ to repair. I can deliver and retrieve, they are too heavy to ship, so I&#x27;d like to find someone in the region.
 Thank you for any recommendations.

                              <span>I am running into and am too stupid to figure it out on my own. I&#x27;ve tried reading google, no one wants to dumb it down for me.
 Scenario: I have Ubuntu Desktop on VMware. I have multiple users for me and 2 friends so we can share the vm. I am installing xrdp so we can all remote in wherever we are (already have vpn up and running).
 We all use windows as our daily drivers because it&#x27;s easy and what we grew up on. We will all be using RDP to get in.
 It works fine on my account after enabling the remote desktop bs in settings. Cannot get it to work at all on the other accounts despite all of them having the same settings. 
 Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. Please educate me.

 Will this do the trick? My home PC is ALOT better, but im 2 years from an upgrade and I&#x27;m chomping at the bit to dabble with my pelco... any advice is appreciated. Total noob in pre planing stages. I have a decent amount of media id like access to throughout my house and perhaps a plex server. Movies and music. Is this enough or should I hold out? Thank you!

This was the listing image and matched what I received. hese cards look like they have a IBM server proprietary connector. Am I on the right track?

So would this be something good to add to my resume? Any feedback is appreciated. It&#x27;s a work in progress and is incomplete so far. One thing I can&#x27;t figure out is how to add a theme to the page, I would like it to be dark.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve mounted my homelab and it is working great! 
 The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I&#x27;m looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.
 I&#x27;ve got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they&#x27;re lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?

                              <span>I’m thinking of setting up a raidz array with eSATA. My current mobo only supports 6 Gb/s sata. It looks like eSATA maxes out at 6 as well. So I’m considering an external hard drive array case and run ZFS. Do you guys see that being problematic at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m running a OPNsense on my proxmox host which serves as the gateway for all my VMs. The proxmox host is running on my LAN at home. My setup:
  
192.168.0.50 - my workstation which i use for daily stuff
 192.168.0.48 - proxmox host
 192.168.0.61 - opnsense gateway which is used to seperate my homelab from my LAN at home
 10.10.10.0/24 - my homelab network
  
If my dc is at e.g. 10.10.10.2/24 - what would be best way to configure the opnsense so that I could rdp into the dc from my workstation at 192.168.0.50?
 ​
 Looking forward to your suggestions, thanks!

                              <span>What are y&#x27;all running for a GPU for transcoding? Or anyone got one for sale? I have 1 stream and source files are 2160p which leads to video stutters every few seconds, so I&#x27;m thinking I should go the GPU transcoding route. I&#x27;m debating on running Plex along side jellyfin to see if jellyfin is the problem but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be.
 The server is in my basement so noise is not an issue.
 Edit: it&#x27;s a 1u server, whoops

                              <span>At home I have dual WAN. I have AT&amp;T Fiber and T-Mobile 5G Home Internet. The T-Mobile connection is CGNAT, so no inbound connections possible
 This is a problem for remote access as well as a service I use that needs to send webhooks to a local server. 
 I set up a Wireguard server on my VPS, setup a tunnel between my firewall at home (PFSENSE) and the VPS, and then I used nginx proxy manager &quot;Streams&quot; to forward the port I need for webhooks to the local host at home
 Now no matter what the internet is doing at home, it will always be able to connect through the tunnel and back to the server
 Now, I want to get a remote access VPN working. I have OpenVPN setup on PFSENSE which works very well for me. I figured I could just do the same and &quot;Stream&quot; 1194 back to the firewall, but it doesn&#x27;t connect. 
 Has anyone gotten this to work?
 I would just use Wireguard on the VPS, but the outbound internet in Linode is not great, a lot of services are blocked by third party companies from Linode IP&#x27;s, and the DNS config in OpenVPN is much better than Wireguard and everything in my home network &quot;Just works&quot; via OpenVPN, not so much with Wireguard

                              <span>Hi all
 There&#x27;s been alot of posts around hosting signal proxies to support Iran. My question is it going to really help? I want to help anyway I can and if a signal proxy will genuinely help I&#x27;ll do it, but iv read conflicting information saying VPNs are needed more. 
 I don&#x27;t know anyone in Iran so not sure I&#x27;d want to host a VPN for anyone to use.
 Interested in others thoughts on this?

 When I am on the tailscale network and I try browse to the service using the DNS entry in pihole, it won&#x27;t work. What am I missing?
  
I have setup Tailscale on my home server (running Ubuntu SE 22.04) and have advertised my docker network as a subnet

                              <span>Curious as to which way the modern wind is blowing. I have nginx setup natively (i.e. not in docker) due to some legacy stuff on my server. Without boring you all with the detail, it took me quite a while to get SSL working on a local intranet via nginx. I am tempted to migrate to a docker container of nginx or caddy, but what I have is also working.
 Who&#x27;s using what now a days? Caddy seems more... recent in its featureset and development. Is it easy enough to deploy?

 I created a home server to essentially replace and finally get rid of Google&#x27;s storage forever, and all was going so well until i realised I needed to constantly update my records with my current public IP since my public IP is dynamic.
 Well, when doing this, I found that Cloudflare blocked API use for my domain name, a .tk free domain, for unknown reasons (all i could find relating to this error on Google were just screams of help and no resolutions whatsoever) and now I&#x27;m just stuck here confused at how I can have my domain still running effectively without having it drop due to the ISP&#x27;s IP cycling.

                              <span>TL;DR
 I&#x27;m sharing a nice 1-line command that prints docker network name and it&#x27;s IP (Gateway&#x27;s IP strictly speaking). See below.
 ​
 Long version
 Problem: in AdguardHome I see all these IPs that are coming from docker containers. I&#x27;d like to see which containers. Turns out it&#x27;s not that straightforward to clearly see what container produces what network at which IP range. (at least not with a simple docker command).
 So, I went on a and wrote a lengthy nodejs script that would loop through docker networks finding these IPs and nicely print them for me.
 Then I realised that there must be an easier way.
 The Bash way.
 So here is the final version of a day&#x27;s work. Maybe it will help someone save the time :-)
 ​
 The command
 (echo &quot;NAME GATEWAY&quot;; docker network inspect $(docker network ls --format&#x3D;&quot;{{.ID}}&quot;) --format&#x3D;&quot;{{.Name}} {{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null) | column -t -s &quot; &quot;

                              <span>All,
 After fighting with Plex and the Plex Service on a domain join windows computer, I&#x27;m needing opinions on a simple DLNA server that can run without any logins or user interactions. We&#x27;ve also had no luck with the built-in DNLA server that Windows 10 has.
 Does anyone have recommendations? I want to be able to reboot that computer on a schedule and still have the DNLA service run when the computer is back online.

                              <span>How do I use nginx proxy manager to tunnel a vikunja instance to my domain? This is my first time using npm, but every time i try to connect to the domain I set for vikunja, I get a 502 bad gateway error. I don&#x27;t think its a problem with the app itself, as if i connect with a direct IP, it runs as intended, but with whatever I have in NPM, it gives me the error. Both my vikunja and npm are in their own docker-compose.yml files, and they are bridged with a docker network. I tried using 127.0.0.1:PORT, localhost:PORT, and vikunja-frontend-1:PORT in the dashboard, but none worked.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Question for anyone who knows Wireguard.
 I have a VPS, it runs the docker container wg-easy, works great. At home I have a PFSENSE Firewall, I configured the wireguard tunnel with the VPS as the server, and I can get traffic over to the VPS via Wireguard with no problem, speeds are great
 My question is, how do I get the traffic to work the other way? Do I need to add some static routes?
 I read this guide:https://hacdias.com/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat
 That does not mention static routes, so I&#x27;m not sure how that exactly works.
 Second question would be, I see that in this guide there is PostUp and PostDown configurations for WireGuard, if I look at the conf for wg-easy, it only has PostUp. Do I need the PostDown?

 Using XCP-NG as the hypervisor. I have 24TB of raw disks. I&#x27;d like to use this disk space mainly for the the backup, but would also like to have some space for other stuff.
 Should I:
  
Setup ZFS on XCP-ng and just give a large virtual disk to the backup VM?
 Setup ZFS on XCP-ng, and then create a NFS/iSCSI share to be mounted from the backup share?
 Setup TrueNAS and pass through the drives, then setup iSCSI or NFS for the connection to the backup VM
 Anything better that I might be missing?

                              <span>Trying to get https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io working right. So I&#x27;m trying to keep me up to date on new free games from https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedeals/new.json?limit&#x3D;50 like this:
 https://i.imgur.com/6F4qFHo.png
 https://i.imgur.com/D0dJhvC.png
 But I&#x27;m not really getting the desired results. I&#x27;m getting notifications whenever anything new is posted there. Even if I put free and 100% in extracting text, I&#x27;d get like 3-4 lines with either 100% or free, which is correct, but when new stuff is posted this extracted 100% or free gets moved around and it triggers new notifications.
 What I really want is compare snapshot x(now) to y(old), if new line or new text with 100% or free appears AND is different to snapshot y THEN trigger.
 Not if it moves around, not if it&#x27;s the same as before.
 A current snapshot looks like that: https://i.imgur.com/bbC5d8q.png
 The diff looks like this and still triggers notifications: https://i.imgur.com/5xnNoQp.png, even though I have checked &quot;new lines&quot; and triggers set to new/100%, I guess moving the lines with &quot;new&quot; and &quot;100%&quot; equals &quot;new lines&quot; which is why it triggers.

                              <span>Hi all! First post in this awesome community. 
 I&#x27;m planning out my first media stack (rough thoughts: https://imgur.com/a/A5hqOH5)
 Two specific questions, in order of priority:
  
How should I set up my VPN such that it&#x27;s only routing traffic from certain services (i.e. the -arr stack and the like) and not from others? 
 If you see the diagram above, should the red arrow be there or is this a misunderstanding?Should all traffic route through the reverse proxy?
 In the described use-case above, how should I set up my VPN? Wireguard on the VM, or gluetun or something else?
 
 Any advice about pros / cons in running k3s / microk8s on VM (proxmox) or bare-metal?
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

Do I need to install something, should I run this in a container after its started? Some guidance would definitely be appreciated.

 Unfortunately all the good ones seem to be cloud based (eg https://www.cheqroom.com/ https://www.ezofficeinventory.com/ https://www.assetpanda.com/)...
 Do you guys know anything similar that can be self-hosted? 
 Would be nice if it was open-source, but not a must.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Cloudflare Access to secure my self-hosted (but on public (sub)domains) services. I noticed that the Bitwarden extensions and apps cannot synchronise anymore when I put the URL behind CF Access. Most likely, the sync agent just gets redirected to the cloudflare login panel, which prevents it from actually syncing anything.
 I&#x27;m using Authelia and Bitwarden&#x27;s inbuilt security so it&#x27;s no huge deal, but would be nice if this could somehow still be behind Access as well - redirecting attacks to cloudflare instead of my own server alleviates some of the risks involved and a password manager has to be very well secured imo. 
 If anyone got ideas on how to tackle this, please LMK!

                              <span>I am currently redoing my nextcloud (previously used snap) and after hours of looking i couldnt really find which one to choose or direct comparisons what the benefits of each one are.
 What i have found out so far:
 Aio didnt really work because i dont want to expose nextcloud (instead access via nextcloud.local)
 Snap is pretty limited in therms of options. Also docker versions seems to have better performance than the other ones.
 What are the benefits of each one?

My long-term goal is that I want to have an adaptable graphical timeline visualization that can show the timelines of multiple people and how they overlap and intersect.
 But to avoid falling into the same trap of trying to develop the perfect solution from the get-go before starting the actual collection and never actually starting the project because I got overwhelmed, I&#x27;m looking for the best &quot;starting&quot; solution that lets me expand later.
 My instinct is to go with a Wiki, that way every person has a dedicated page to make tagging and linking fairly trivial later on. It&#x27;s also a recognizable format that lots of people w…</span>

 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I&#x27;m completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a &quot;bad&quot; reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

                              <span>I have Promox running Portainer in 1 VM. Portainer is hosting Homer Intranet page, port 9455; I have Uptime Kuma on 3000. I want homer to display some stats of Uptime Kuma but I keep getting CORS error. Homer troubleshooting says to use a CORS anywhere solution but I just can&#x27;t figure it out. 
 I use Nginx Proxy Manager to create proxies for portainer, 10.1.2.3:9455 to intranet.my.lan. 
 Is it possible to use this same tool for fixing this CORs issue?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m rebuilding my server, while adding more features, moving away for it being just a nas box plus a docker host, it will give me the ability to host vms have software raid etc.
 My 2 options were proxmox, and freenas, having worked with the first, the continuous pop-ups about buying licenses, plus the inability to manage network shares on its own, it&#x27;s a turn off, even if it has a very straightforward way for managing VMs.
 Now, freenas, seems tailored made to act like a nas, with vms feeling like a afterthought, for example, I cannot find a way to have a vm obtain a IP Address from my network&#x27;s DHCP server, only behind NAT.(on proxmox this was a simple toggle called bridge connection) Documentation on this, imply that bridges are for link aggregation. (https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/network/interfaces/bridgecreate/). If there are any solution to this, I&#x27;ll be more than happy to to give freenas a go.

                              <span>Hi all!
 For an internal workflow and data management tool I am looking for the best software. I will most likely use a Postgres Database and would prefer a free project.
 So far I looked at Budibase, Appsmith and Tooljet, of which discarded Budibase for it&#x27;s weird and non-intuitive UI.
 I wondered what other users think about usability and suitable use cases.
 Thank you so much for giving me an insight into your projects, I highly appreciate it!

                              <span>This happens, when you try to get away from hosted services. And this only covers my most basic needs. I still find it way to complicated and convoluted. Any ideas for simplification?
 My self-hosting setup
 Legend:
  
Blue Stuff: Mobile
 Purple Stuff: Desktop
 Grey Stuff: My Server
 White Stuff: Other people&#x27;s servers
 Orange Stuff: Data
 Green Stuff: Actions
  
Suggestions should try to follow these principles:
  
No Software that is written in an interpreted language
 Software needs to be non-commercial and preferably open-source
 If possible, the software should follow an open standard
 Software needs to be standalone, no additional dependencies
 Smaller and simpler is better

                              <span>Hi all; with the way YouTube has continued expanding it&#x27;s ads (both in length and frequency), what self hosted service (Invidious, Viewtube, Piped, etc.) you see as the best way forward for continued access to YouTube content sans the ads and the tracking? I&#x27;ve long hosted a small Invidious instance for myself and a few other folks, but I have been making some changes lately and wanted to see what the most current wisdom on this front was. Thanks!

                              <span>I normally boot onto an SSD, but I just got a new 2tb hard drive. I tried plugging it in, and now when I try to start, I get power for about one second then everything just goes off. 
 I&#x27;m not trying to boot onto the hard drive or anything, just plugged it in for the first time, and am still booting off of the SSD. My assumption now is that my old 450 watt power source doesn&#x27;t have enough power for it, so it&#x27;s just causing the power to go off after a second. Any other ideas what might be causing this? Could an incorrectly plugged in drive cause this? I don&#x27;t see why it would cause it to power off immediately unless it&#x27;s trying to draw too much power.

All the Spotify to mp3 converter are either paid or only allow for up to 1 minute per. Does anyone know how I could do that? I can get Spotify files downloaded from a friend with premium if that is needed.

                              <span>Full disclaimer: I am using a Windows 10 Machine (mostly for Plex) and do not want to switch to Unraid or any other OS. I would like to get this figured out using just Windows 10.
 Please help me understand how this works when I go to set this up on my Windows 10 machine. I currently use Storage Spaces, but it is a pain to use and I&#x27;ve heard good things about using Stablebit DrivePool and Snapraid together and I&#x27;m leaning towards switching.
 I have 10 8TB drives I want to use. From what I&#x27;ve read, I would likely want to use 8 of the drives for data and 2 for parity. I would use DrivePool (without duplication) to essentially make a big 64TB drive (at least that&#x27;s how the pool would present in Windows, right?), and then configure Snapraid to use the 2 remaining disks as parity disks.

 in fact, lately it seems that jd can&#x27;t even grab a single picture or video off of it, and raider gives &#x27;no profile found&#x27; error.

 I was wondering because I always see HDDs for sale on r/buildapcsales and sometimes see some WD reds and red pluses. So is it better to buy whatever I see on sale there for a reasonable price or wait for black friday and shuck the easystore 8tb bestbuy hdds. I&#x27;m not sure how the performance of those drives in the easystore are compared to the ones that go on sale as a sole drive.
 ​
 thanks for inputs!

 Of those one huge channel with 6000 videos over the past 12 years was recently deleted. Still, a seemingly safe gaming channel has had about a dozen videos either privated/unlisted or deleted (some due to newly added age verification hits)
 I do not wish to disclose the exact channels/videos, these videos will soon end up on archive_dot_org. Though it&#x27;s a warning to you: add all your subbed and favorite channels to a daily youtube-dl (yt-dlp) download.
 If you subbed to too many channels to create a list manually: create a Google Takeout for the youtube profile you&#x27;re using, set the smallest archive size. The first archive will contain a CSV with subscriptions.

Obviously I am going to be needing a bit more storage space than the 240GB M2 SSD that&#x27;s already in there. For my intents and purposes I expect to be needing about 10 TB of space. I have already settled for SSDs as opposed to HDDs because of various factors (biggest ones being power and noise) and I am currently working on a plan to integrate them into a flexible system of drives. Since the Nuc I plan on getting only supports one more 2.5&quot; drive I am going to have to come up with solutions to connect the drives externally. I have been researching for many hours now on how that would look like if I want to keep the total cost as low as possible and I have come u…</span>

                              <span>Hi
 I have a rather large video library (none of it personal videos) it&#x27;s all made Movies and Series so I can replace it if I have to, though it would be inconvenient.
 I just filled up my 4th 5tb (because they&#x27;re portable) drive and currently the prices are a bit rediculous, so I&#x27;m gonna be stuck with what I have for a few months. I have two 500gb drives, which is barely large enough for anything. i wanted to merge it into a Spanned Volume so that I&#x27;d have a 1tb drive.
 My question if one fails then what happens to my data. As i said, I can replace the series, since I got them all from the internet or by backing up my DVD collection, so I don&#x27;t mind it but it would be inconvenient.
 Since it&#x27;s just series, performance isnt much of a concern, as long as the shows play smoothly, I&#x27;d be happy.
 Also would it ware my drives out faster. They&#x27;re pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven&#x27;t seen much use. It&#x27;s just 500GB&#x27;s each so I don&#x27;t mind them breaking in a few years but until the prices of the 5tb&#x27;s in my country come down a bit, I don&#x27;t want to replace them.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have 4 x Seagate Exos 7E8 8TB (ST8000NM000A-2KE101) and I just learned that there might be an issue with the factory default settings on these drives resulting in rapidly increasing load cycle due to low disk activity. I have had my drives for about one and a half year on a server that is has very little accessed and I can se the Load_Cycle_Count is already above 45K!! Now I am terrified that these drives will start dying on me. 
 I have these on a Linux system and I am not sure about what to do. I figure I need to install the SeaChest/openSeaChest tool and change some parameters. Does anyone know how to install the tool on Linux and which parameters I need to change? I have the drives set up in a ZFS 2 x mirrored vdev configuration. Are the operations I need to do with the SeaChest tool safe while the drives are in normal operation in the ZFS pool?

                              <span>I have been steadily accumulating video, photo and audio data, as well as project files as long as I&#x27;ve had a computer. My hobbies have led me to take photos on family/friend holidays, special occasions, press shots for people, footage of music videos/live events, downloaded song library for DJing, the list goes on.
 Anxiety warning - until recently this data was sprawled across a collection of relatively unprotected internal hard drives, old USB thumb drives, external drives, memory cards and my current and past machines. I took it upon myself to consolidate this data on one external drive and have since mostly organised it. For the task I chose a WD 12TB My Book external drive, of which I bought two.
 Question - I want to sync the two 12TB external drives through my Windows 10 machine, I&#x27;ll call them A and B.
 After an initial carbon copy of the two drives, the dream is to easily update the B drive now and then with any additions or organisation changes that I make on my A drive, automatically (after plugging both drives into the computer), without having to remember the file pathways for each change or addition.
 I have been informed by some lovely folk over at r/Archiveteam that shucking these enclosures and building a NAS system could be an option for me, but I would like to explore any ideas people had that didn&#x27;t involve buying more hardware. 
 Would appreciate any advice on this, thank you in advance!

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about drives failing and such. I have my media stored on a few drives and would like to know the best way to go about backing them up? This is on a Linux setup.
 Do I just copy them over (after zipping them or something) to another drive? Do I use a backup software, like rsync or Bacula? I don&#x27;t understand much about the redundancy thing with Raid and I also don&#x27;t have the drives or the budget for drives to support it, like some people do.
 My media is mostly movies/shows but there&#x27;s also smaller files, images, books, etc.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>For the mods, this is not advertisement nor selling, just asking. well it very sounds like some hustle, but let me tell you.
 I’m korean (south, obviously), and the thing is, recently one of the biggest filecoin mining pool here has been liquidating their equipments. 
 They said most of their disk’s uptime is average 5000-10000h, manufactured in early 2021, I/O barely happened (they have been ‘floating’ as term in filecoin)
 So I thought, “Well, so they’re basically dumping pre-tested HUGE hard drives (datacenter grade even)?”
 So I bought 2 WD HC530 14TB drives and currently waiting for my PERC H310 to come in order to connect SAS drives.
 I&#x27;ve bought dozens of these liquidation deals time to time, and I can tell you these are the good one. almost new. dustless, no scratches.
 And the second thing to tell you is, since current currency rate is very low for korean won, these are even cheaper in dollars. so I thought “Well, maybe I can sell these to datahoarders?”
 So here I am. Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$. These are used, not refurbished.

                              <span>so i see things like this for big seagate exos drives and the like:
  
Standard model, ships in 512e format, Fast Format allows either 512e or 4Kn sector size 
  
and dont know what it means. is this a feature i should be looking for, or something for compatibility? 
 fyi im running a zfs filesystem on my truenas scale server using mainly repurposed desktop components. i am currently using smallish ironwolf drives but my next pool is going to be a mirror of something like 2 x 12+TB drives and i dont want to buy until i understand this feature.
 thanks all.

                              <span>Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.
 I&#x27;m currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don&#x27;t enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).
 From what I can decipher reading the interview:
  
They&#x27;re intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical&#x27;s traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).
 Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned &quot;somewhere between&quot; Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there&#x27;s currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.
 The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I&#x27;ll leave it at that.
  
What I didn&#x27;t see in the coverage (if I&#x27;m not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we&#x27;re talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc&#x27;s inorganic pitting &quot;secret sauce&quot; or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?
 I&#x27;d be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:
  
How optimistic you are about this project?
 Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we&#x27;re talking WORM) backup.

                              <span>Hey all, I recently discovered Dr. John Campbell&#x27;s YT channel, and in one of his more recent videos he mentioned that he recently received a strike against his channel for proliferating misinformation. If you&#x27;re familiar with his content, he&#x27;s been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he&#x27;s a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it&#x27;s a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won&#x27;t be around for long, since he&#x27;s been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you&#x27;ve ever watched any of his content, you&#x27;d know he&#x27;s extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I&#x27;m thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I&#x27;m looking at? Thank you.

                              <span>Setting up a Synology NAS currently and have a storage pool of 2tb in a RAID 1 config. It’s now asking me to create a volume and logically my brain wants to create a single volume of 2tb, however that seems inefficient as I won’t be using all 2tbs. 
 Is there a functional difference between creating a single max size volume vs creating multiple smaller sized volumes as needed? 
 Also can I get a quick run down on partition vs volume vs allocation size?

                              <span>Folks, I&#x27;ve created and just released an open-source fully automated multithreaded system for archiving images uploaded to Discord channels directly to the WordPress website, with MySQL and AWS S3 cloud storage support.
 It&#x27;s essentially a multithreaded Python script that takes Discord images (e.g. Midjourney or any channel) and sends the full high-resolution version of the image automatically to Amazon S3 storage (creates thumbnails as well) and also auto-uploads each image as a new post (along with all the details) into the WordPress website. This is where either you (as an author) or people (if you share it with the online community) can see the image collection process in real-time (as the archiving process takes place).

                              <span>Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I&#x27;m thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.
 I&#x27;ve come across some comments like &quot;NAS isn&#x27;t intended to be turned on/off&quot; or vague comments such as &quot;they aren&#x27;t rated for that&quot; but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don&#x27;t see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.
 Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.

                              <span>Has anyone looked into this? I did some digging but all I found were logs from https://www.gharchive.org/, these are helpful but I&#x27;ll have to download all of them and then extract the usernames, and then after that clone each repository.
 ​
 Just asking if there&#x27;s already an existing tool, it would be nice to have something where I can have a threshold of how many stars each repository has.
 ​
 I already did most of the work and I can continue using my method, but I&#x27;m just asking if there&#x27;s something that already exists and is maintained.
 ​
 Here are the steps I took:
 I&#x27;ve downloaded all the logs in 2 methods
  
using the API on https://www.gharchive.org/ &#x60;wget https://data.gharchive.org/20{15..22}-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz&#x60;, it actually ended up being 800GB which is insane
 the other way is to use google cloud platform BigQuery, I downloaded a CSV of users which was almost the size of 300MB CSV file
  
now that I have these, I can then use github api to get their repositories.

 Thinking books as well and guides for gardening. Size isn’t really an issue as I’m planning on building a nas to connect to my solar generator. Just some stuff to get started, I have about 10TB of shows and movies as such (rather small). Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

 I’m looking to move away from my QNAP NAS to a DAS. The DAS will be connecting to an HP ProDesk 600 G6 Mini which is running as a Plex server / Home Assistant server, and which supports USB C 3.1 Gen 2 (or USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 as HP like to call it!). It doesn’t support Thunderbolt. The DAS won&#x27;t be moving to any other computers at any time, staying connected to the server.
 I don’t want to add extra stress to the server (i3-10300T and 32gb DDR4-2667 but runs 24/7 for HA) so I’m thinking hardware RAID, and because I’ll be running at least four drives I want RAID 5 support. I can’t fit a RAID card in the ProDesk 600 G6 min…</span>

Media of all types: books, films, videos, music, audio, animation, photo and art. It is more or less organized as filesystem and folders/subfolders serve as categories/tags of interest. Last couple years i have thoughts maybe there is better and more robust ways to catalog and use my stuff.
 Today i gave it a light google search and found some free solutions: GCStar, DataCrow, Tellico. Did not tried them yet because it looks like a lot of work to transfer from my current way of doing things and get feeling of the programs usability.
 Most important things for me now:

 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096WHH242?psc&#x3D;1&amp;ref&#x3D;ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
 Price is right imho and once installed crystal disk says they have been powered on 2 times with 4 hours of run time and no errors. Seems legit? I am thinking of adding them into my NAS and building a new set based of 12TB drives with maybe 3 more for a total of 5. Am i missing something or should I check something else before buying more? I have been out of the NAS drives game for so long i feel newbish.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 ​
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. 
 I&#x27;d prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. 
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

                              <span>(Wow. The title is awesomely misleading.) I have a lot of conference videos which i need to stream to people who are interested in listening to again. Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into &quot; nsfw&quot; territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?
 We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>After having many issues with flash drives over the years, I have recently reverted back to using optical media for backup/ archival purposes. Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. 
 I&#x27;ve found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. 
 I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I&#x27;m working on periodically. 
 I&#x27;ve had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them. I use SSDs instead.

                              <span>Posting in r/DataHoarder since we got such a great response last time :) We mirrored a *lot* more books from Z-Library. We were pretty surprised by how much their collection has grown over the last year, since we first scraped it in mid 2021.
 Anyway our full blog post is here: http://annas-blog.org/blog-3x-new-books.html Seeds would be again very welcome. We got a good number of seeds for our first collection, so thanks for helping with that!

                              <span>I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can&#x27;t quite remember when I purchased and how much I&#x27;ve used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was &quot;stored&quot; on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I&#x27;d been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)
 I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn&#x27;t the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?
 Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.
 I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I&#x27;ve run some tests on it I&#x27;m starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical
 (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of advice from all the posts here through the years, but now I have a question that warrants a post.
 I am looking to add more extended battery systems, but am out of rack space to mount them. I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?
 I&#x27;ve got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg
 Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better. I wonder if anyone has had any experience with this.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I have a small question concerning the CPU Temperature on my Dell R715 running Proxmox (Linux). My end goal is to write a script that change fan speed depending on the cpus temperature. I have the script written and in a working state, but I don&#x27;t really know what temperature to listen to.
 Why I don&#x27;t know what temperature to trust ? well, because nothing makes sense!
 Here are my temperatures reported by IPMI and sensors when the server is at idle (with working LXC container, but not much load:

 And here is temperatures when all 16 cores are stressed:

 As you can see, underload temperatures risesd in the sensors command, but not in the…</span>

                              <span>I picked up a 42u rack locally and I’m now realizing it’s definitely a networking rack and I have some concerns. I’d love to use this rack if possible because it’s very sturdy and too heavy to move again 😂
 Question is will an R730 fit in this threaded rack where the depth between the front and back threads is 27.5” (69.85cm)? I found I need to buy the Dell 331-0166 2U PKCR1 2CGTG Threaded ReadyRail Adapter kit to made this work which I’m willing to do but now worried that it’s too shallow for the rails to properly click in and seat the server?
 I don’t care if it sticks out of the back past the rack, I don’t have a back cover. I’m new to this and just want to make sure before I invest in the adapter kit and rails that it’ll slide in there properly. 
 I have a PE 2950 III as well I plan to rack so I’ll need two kits if anyone has one to sell! 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all - long time lurker first time poster,
 I’ve got my hands on two older desktops which I want to use as a NAS, and for labbing around with in vm’s and such. (Possibly also a BlueIris NVR)
 Pc’s are both running i7-4790’s and have 32GB of 1600Mhz DDR3. Both machines have 256gb of SATA SSD and 128GB of PCI SSD (dont ask about the PCI i dont know either) One also has a Quadro K4000 and the other a Quadro K4200
 Ive also got access to 6x 2TB WD Black Enterprise drives, with 4 being already installed in one machine and 2 sitting cold, as well as the odd 1TB HDD sitting as storage in the other machine
 I’ve and have played with Proxmox on these, but not sure if I have enough power to run or if its overkill for what I want to be doing - eg if TrueNAS will be sufficient
 Not sure how well Plex &amp; BlueIris NVR will go on the hardware due to being virtualised and being on the older side. 
 Would love some opinions! PFA of my dusty and cable mess of new projects! (don’t worry will be cleaned soon)

                              <span>Hello,
 I am an amateur photographer mostly focusing on wildlife photography but occasionally help out other with events. I am currently self hosting my storage solutions using truenas in a VM that is not exposed remotely. I am looking for some software solutions for the following tasks: 
  
Remote uploading photos from wherever I am. I would like to be able to make backups easily. Deduplication would be nice feature here. This would need security but I believe nginx can handle that.
 File download if someone has a link, username, and password ( does not have to be super secure but ddos protection would be nice). To share files with people and event organizers when relevant. Zipping would be nice
 Basic file/directory exploration. I would like to be able to share a single photo with people or see if I have a photo of a particular bird species .
  
What I have tried:
  
Libre photos does not seem to have upload or download tools and not directory structure
 Next cloud seems to be a lot more that I need and doesn&#x27;t seem to play nice with truenas for me at least accessing existing files.
 Currently I manually make zip files for sharing and link them in html tag for download but that can be time intensive
  
I would prefer FOSS but I am willing to talk if it&#x27;s cheap enough. This is all hobby work.

                              <span>Hi all - I&#x27;ve been slowly building up my lab from having a single 6-core server to also having a few older generation NUCs and a laptop. With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don&#x27;t care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.
 Now, I&#x27;ve installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it&#x27;s really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. 
 So my questions are: 
 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? 
 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).
 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?
 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?
 Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out. Sorry if some of those questions are basic, I wasn&#x27;t able to get conclusive answers on the web.

                              <span>So i install FreeIPA so I could run ldap for sso and use it as a certificate authority. 
 I cant reach the WebUI from my desktop computer. I can ssh in, I can get a kerberos ticket from my desktop as well. I checked to make sure httpd is working and it is. I even install a user interface to see if i could reach the webUI from itself, I can. 
 When I type in the IP address for the server, it switches to the FQDN. Then gives me &quot;Unable to connect&quot; error. 
 I didn&#x27;t set up dns when i installed it, so I imagine it is dns some how

                              <span>Hey there!
 ​
 I&#x27;m running Mac Mini Late 2012 with Debian as a home server.
 I just got done with installing ssh and I was wondering how can I have movies / series MP4s be watchable with all of my devices? 
 I read that SMB is pretty unsecure. Is there an SMB alternative that is more secure?
 Also having a Web GUI would be cool since I don&#x27;t have any DE installed.
 ​
 The software would need to run on Samsung Smart TV, PS3, mobile devices etc.
 ​
 Thanks for reading my post

                              <span>Just looking for some info/advice please.
 Currently I have a home server that I&#x27;m running a few services on and exposing some of these (nextcloud, bitwarden etc) to the internet via a cloudflare tunnel and routing internal traffic through nginx proxy manager.
 I&#x27;ve been having a play with some cloud based servers lately, mainly just as a testing ground for projects. I was wondering if it is possible, or even if there would be any security benefits to point my domains/cloudflare tunnel to the cloud server and then route the traffic via a tunnel or VPN connection in to my home server from the cloud server?
 If this is possible and there is an advantage in it please could someone help out with some info on what software/setup you used?

                              <span>I have an HP z600 that I am using to host a cople services, such as portianer. In my server is included a NVIDIA Quadro P2000 that doesn&#x27;t seem to get recognized automatically by portainer. I tried looking around online but I haven&#x27;t seen any similar problem 
 I oblviously made sure that both portainer and NVIDIA Drivers are at the latest version available, was wondering if anyone had encountered this problem before and if it is solvable 
 I am currently running Ubuntu Server 20.04.5 LTS

 some of these services are: Photoprism, Navidrome, Jellyfin, Qbitorrent
 Is there any service that can add 2FA to these existing services ?
 or is there any modifcation that can be done to these existing services themselves to get 2FA ? 
 Thanks in advance for any help :)

                              <span>I often see posts or videos about homelab projects and almost everytime I hear no mention about SWAG with nginx or traefik being mentioned instead. I personally use SWAG for reverse-proxy and certs and I&#x27;m happy with it but seeing that almost everyone else is using other platform I feel like an outsider and I start to wonder: what am I missing? Is not SWAG the right choice to secure and proxy my web-services? And why I don&#x27;t see more people talking about it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an HP envy laptop with i7-10510U and 16gb ram and 500GB SSD (even has a discrete 250MX nvidia GPU).
 It is currently mostly unused, I was running proxmox on it for some time with a few VMs and containers, but currently thinking of migrating to TrueNAS Scale, the obvious problem with a laptop that there are no sata ports (or expandability in general is very limited).
 So in order to really benefit zfs and use it as a proper NAS, the only way it seems is using some sort USB enclosures/dockings for SATA HDDs/SSDs, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a decent option.
 Note: there&#x27;s a USB-C port which can act as a display port / charging / data - perhaps there are some things for storage I can plug in there as a more reliable alternative to &quot;just regular&quot; USB-A ports?
 Note2: The data stored on it is not super critical, mostly family photos and some movies etc. and I&#x27;m backing up automatically to Backblaze anyway, so things like ECC memories and edge cases are not really a concern.
 Alternative option:
 I have a tower gaming PC which is running pretty much 24/7 anyway, so I could through in a bunch of HDDs, and run TrueNAS scale in hyper-v. Though that leaves the laptop without a purpose really, and it has more than decent hardware for a home server.
 What do you suggest?
 Thanks

Is there a way to repurpose these using some self hosted method to pick up the signal or turn them into some generic radio signal I can use my rtl setup to pick up or are they essentially trash now?

 What I would like to know is if there is any way or tool to delete some data from the source automatically after it is synced with my syncthing and uploaded to the destination?
 I don&#x27;t know if in syncthing or with another tool that could be done to keep the source disks always with enough space

                              <span>Hi!
 I setup Homer using Docker with Portainer, but the one thing I don&#x27;t get running are the Services / Status. My mapped directory contains the config file and folders for icons, but where do I place the content of homer/src/components/services/? Or are those already somewhere? :-) For pihole I then added:
  - name: &quot;Pi-hole&quot; url: &quot;http://192.168.2.100/admin&quot; tag: &quot;smarthome&quot; logo: &quot;assets/tools/icons/pihole.png&quot; subtitle: &quot;&quot; # optional, if no subtitle is defined, PiHole statistics will be shown type: &quot;PiHole&quot; 
 But nothing is shown :-(
 ​
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Looking for self hosted tool for track own tasks, I use notion but wants sth selfhosted, I really would love following features * multiple project&#x27;s * project card can contains markdown content * card can have custom property * multiple views and filters * API
 Actually that could be two different apps just wants to have possibility to connect card with note via some kinda link or sth
 Does anyone know something what might be worth to have a look? Or maybe you use something to track personal tasks what might be better?

                              <span>Until I started meddling with self-hosted services I thought that I know at least enough about networks and requests but struggling to understand what some services do, thought me differently. 
 I am currently running a test server (playing around and learning Proxmox). This one is a gen 6 i3 NUC. I am waiting for a gen 8 i5 NUC to arrive. The idea is to make a Proxmox cluster and put all the essential services on the weaker device and all the other goodies on the more powerful one. In the next few days, I will ask some questions to better understand what I actually need. 
 Intro
 My network is a very simple one. I use /24 address space on a Synology router as the default gateway, and behind it have currently two Win10 machines, soon to be two NUCs, a TV, and a printer hardwired, and every…</span>
