                              <span>I am self hosting without a static IP.
 I know that we can ask DDNS providers (like DuckDNS) for a subdomain (e.g. example.duckdns.org), and it will point to my IP as long as I keep updating DDNS entries with tools like ddclient.
 Say I buy a domain from some domain registrar. What do I need to do to ensure the domain points to my IP? Does it still involve DDNS providers? And is the process different with different registrars?

 I just want a simple explorer I can access, and drag my files in. I run the server exe myself and its all done manually.
 Does anyone have any recommendations and could you tell me what this would even be called because I&#x27;m struggling to search for it without the right terms.
 Thanks!

                              <span>What is the preferred way to encrypt a volume on disk that is shared through a NAS?
 I looked into following options but all store data unencrypted:
  
Synology - SMB
 Raspberry Pi OS - SMB
 OpenMediaVault -SMB
 Create Veracrypt container on a SMB shared folder. But as SMB is file level storage, wouldn&#x27;t it upload/update the whole file when a change is made inside the Veracrypt container?
  
Any recommendations for SMB? Preferring it due to the robust support available across OSes.

 is there something out there I can get used for a good price that would support those? going to the x550 is almost 4 times the price (60 bucks vs 200)

                              <span>I have several WireGuard tunnels. I have the latest one deployed on my OPNsense firewall. I have one firewall rule in place on the wg interface to allow everything inbound.
 I have the DNS set to the IP of the firewall and another to 8.8.8.8.
 Upon removing 8.8.8.8, DNS still does not resolve, but I lose internet access. This leads me to believe the tunnel cannot get to IP_OF_FIREWALL for DNS requests.
 I can ping and access everything (including IP_OF_FIREWALL) by IP on my subnets, but DNS will not resolve.
 I have tested this on Windows and Android, both externally. Everything works except DNS.
 ​
 I feel like I&#x27;m missing something here whether that be a firewall rule or something stupid. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I am looking to convert my existing trays in the Rosewill RSV-4000 (w/ three 3x5.25&quot; bays) to hot-swappable bays. I see a few options on the internet, but am not looking to spend the money associated with the ICY dock as I could just get a used server online. I am looking for something in the range of &lt;$100. Any user experience on bays that were used in this case, or generally recommend?
 I was looking at this, but don&#x27;t want a fire hazard as well. Actually looks like the old norco ss-500.
 Any input is appreciated!

                              <span>I recently ordered a TrueNas box to migrate my white box NAS into, and I want to take the opportunity to revisit my backup strategy. It really seems like unlimited cloud storage is dead, and doing the math, backing up my 18TB ZFS pool to e.g. B2 would cost $90 a month (!), compared to what I paid with CrashPlan before they went belly up. And I was on backblaze until I stopped daily driving a single windows machine. 
 I’m gonna shut up before I ramble, but I’m curious because searching around the sub I sure get that impression.

                              <span>Time and time again I find movies I&#x27;m after on misc torrent sites and 9 out 10 times I don&#x27;t see any technical information like video bitrates, What audio tracks are included, if there are commentaries etc.
 Sometimes I&#x27;m able to cross match with certain sites but not always and pasting the full release name in a search engine hardly ever brings any usable results.
 Are there any sites or sources where I can find the nfo&#x27;s/technical specs for ALL releases that are scene or almost scene?
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi. Total newbie here. I was wondering if I could get some external HDD to be accessibld via wifi or Ethernet. 
 After some research, I found that the general answer is a NAS. However, I find this solution to be much more of what I need: a place in my local area network to put my stuff.
 Do you have any advise? Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got some music on my hard drive which I listen to and seed via bittorrent. Problem is, it is a lot of random folders, some with discographies, some with separate albums, all in different formats, with a lot of broken tags and some other weirdness. I&#x27;d want to back all this up in a more organized format: something like a bunch of &quot;artist/album&quot; folders, with all the files in a single format (AAC, maybe?) for file compression. 
 For that, I&#x27;ve tried using SoundConverter. While it does work, more or less, it is quite bugged - sometimes it just puts files in random places, it can&#x27;t handle album icons, and when there are issues with tags (No tags, tags with spelling issues, tags with encoding issues, you name it) it does weird things. 
 I thought about trying to hack around some Python to do that for me, but I feel that it is a problem which is probably solved already. Despite that, I wasn&#x27;t able to find any software better then SC. What programs do you use to organize your stuff?

 hi all,
 my archive recently is growing fast, and so is my worry of file corruption**–** mostly involving compressed archives and iso&#x27;s
 so i ask, what is the best way to handle such file? it is to decompress and store them or just store the compressed archive in a dedicated section? and the iso&#x27;s?

                              <span>Hi there
 I&#x27;m interested in getting a NAS, although I&#x27;m having some trouble on what route to take, hoping to get some advice here
 I&#x27;m currently debating on whether I want to buy a Synology NAS or maybe just finding some old PowerEdge tower server that can fit 4 bays (going to be buying 4x4TB Red Plus HDDs, should be sufficient for my storage needs ~ for now ~)
 But the Synology NAS is quite expensive, around $550 here in Canada - pre tax
 I don&#x27;t mind the cost, but one thing I plan on doing is accessing this NAS outside the network, going to be keeping it at my parents until I have a big enough space to keep whatever I get
 Would the Synology NAS be good in this case? 
 I&#x27;ve searched around on the subreddit but haven&#x27;t had much luck

                              <span>Hello!
 I like running a command to essentially mirror my 6TB drive to another identical 6TB drive every week or two. For now, I prefer it to RAID. The command is set up to only mirror files that have been changed, rather than copying EVERYTHING each time. Th initial mirror back in the day was a big one, but all subsequent ones just update what&#x27;s been changed.
 The issue I have is that the destination drive ends up with less available space than the source drive, even though they should be identical in size after the mirror.
 Currently, the source drive shows 276GB/5.45TB free, while the destination drive shows 178GB/5.45TB free.
 If I click into each drive and manually check all the file sizes, they come out identical, yet somehow the drive summary graph always shows higher usage on the destination drive.
 I have hidden files being shown, including protected OS files. I should note that both drives are separate from the OS drive, and only used to store media files.
 I don&#x27;t have any compressed files on either drive. Both drives have a cluster size of 4096 Bytes, with 512 Bytes per sector.
 I&#x27;m just stuck scratching my head as to why the drives show different file sizes. It&#x27;s like there&#x27;s a super-hidden file somewhere on the Destination Drive, but I can&#x27;t find it. Any guidance is appreciated!
 EDIT: Here is the RoboCopy command for reference: robocopy P: B: /mir /v

                              <span>I have multiple 5 TB external hard drives for backing up a family video collection. These drives are all less than one-year old. 
 Several of drives have had same issue over the past few months: slow initialization/mounting and slow transfer time (around 10/mbps). I have seemingly tried all I can think of to isolate the issue: tried different Macs, different formats (APFS and Mac OS Extended), different cables, etc. Sometimes it improves, but then reverts back to being slow. The interesting thing is that I tried WD’s 2 TB models and have not had these problems. 
 I running Mac OS Catalina on a late 2013 iMac and a M1 MacBook (2020) running Monterey. The source drive is a Samsung T7 2TB SSD. The targets/backups are WD 5 TB Elements USB 3.0. For backup software, I use Carbon Copy Cloner. 
 Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have never archived any data before, and I think it&#x27;s time to sort out my mess of hard drives before it&#x27;s too late. 
 I&#x27;m looking at archiving my photos, videos and university work to optical media. I&#x27;m unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.
 I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.
 The data I&#x27;m storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.
 I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it&#x27;s worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback on this topic. 
 Many thanks :)

                              <span>Hey all - I&#x27;m searching for a replacement for the Addonics AD5HPMREU HPM-XU and I ran across this post which mentions the U3-QS3 (I purchased one, but have not tested it yet). I&#x27;m looking to control around 20 SATA CD/DVD ROM drives, so port density and cost become important. Is anyone aware of similar boards - I really liked that the HPM-XU used a USB-B connector instead of the MicroUSB.
 I&#x27;m putting all of this into a dedicated enclosure, which will connect via USB to a PC or laptop. I&#x27;m specifically looking for solutions that do not require a host computer/bus (other than USB) but do have power within my enclosure to power drives and cards like the U3-QS3.
 FWIW - Most off the shelf cheap USB3 -&gt; SATA cables appear to not support ATAPI.
 I&#x27;m not interested in building a dedicated computer to do this - I want a USB3 interface I can move around, and plug into multiple devices w/out having to bring anything else with me.

 HDD&#x27;s were magnitudes more expensive and software like plex didn&#x27;t exist so I&#x27;m wondering if this was a thing at all back then.

 Could somebody explain what the difference is between this regular Seagate model and the Seagate Backup Ultra Touch ?
 They&#x27;re both about the same prize but you get 2TB with the regular one as opposed to the 1TB of the Ultra Touch. I&#x27;d like to know what the added value of the expensive one is, if any.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I run plex and a number of docker containers, standard nginx webserver, and I use the machine for testing code, mainly python.
 I&#x27;ve been running this config in some fashion for around 5 years now. Just thought I&#x27;d get some feedback on better ways or more efficient ways.
 The machine is currently in the garage, not climate controlled. HD temps run around 35-40C sometimes in the summer up to 50c it get quite dusty. I was considering going synology with a a 5bay and a number of very large drives, just for plex
 This is the most recent iteration:
  
Supermicro H11SSL-NC AMD EPYC 7401 24-Core Processor
 128gb ecc RAM 2667MHz
 Nvidia p2000 gpu
 2x LSI HBA
 LSISAS3008 and LSISAS2008.
 2 x Thinkserver SA120 Direct Attached Storage
 2x 12 bays full of random drive sizes mostly shucked WD or Seagate Barracudas - one SA120 is backup zpool the other is active.
 (cron job rsync between them hourly)
 total size: 65TB for main zpool 25TB for backup zpool
 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS OS
 Case is just an EATX basic tower. Nothing special in anyway
  
before i go down this road. is it even feasible to get 60tb of space and have 4-5 simultaneous streams on something like a synology that is quiet enough to keep indoors in a home office?
 edit:
 tl;dr
 I guess my question is how do I achieve high amount of storage with the lowest noise and heat issues?

                              <span>Hello, data hoarders, I am not one of you, I just came to seek a bit of help :)
 Is there a way to search through the archived websites with an exact part of the URL? 
 ​
 Example:
 Archived website URL: www.example.com/things/database/knownword
 So I only know the &quot;knownword&quot; from the URL, also the title of the website is&quot;knownword&quot;. The website is surely archived, but still archive.org doesn&#x27;t give me that website as a result when I try to search for it.
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Been using it for a while and just noticed that it&#x27;s contacting CDN77 and DataCamp Limited even when I&#x27;m using Proxy and with update check turned off. Not sure what it&#x27;s doing and how to check it, but that seems suspicious.
 Does JDownloader2 or any other downloader do the same?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve been looking at cloud storage options, and the best plan I&#x27;ve found is the Microsoft 365 Family plan, that with 6 accounts you can end up with 6TB of data for $100/yr.
 I&#x27;m wanting at least 2TB, though of course more is welcome, I&#x27;d be open to smaller plans that were at least 2TB if they were cheaper. Does anyone know any better cloud deals?
 Alternatively, what would be my better options for local storage? There are so many options here and terms I don&#x27;t know, that I&#x27;m a bit lost. It looks like the startup costs would be relatively high, and then drives will need replacing fairly often, I&#x27;m wondering if at $100 a year (or less if anyone has suggestions) if the cloud would actually be cheaper than local storage in the long run.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I asked the previous owner of our house not to throw away what he didn’t want and wow do I have a lot to digitize and hoard. While digging through a large box of VHS tapes I realized I hadn’t seen most of these sleeves in 20+ years and felt they would be a good candidate to scan and upload to archive.org. I have the first 6 scanned and uploaded. Sadly most of the tapes have molded and with only 1 of 4 VCRs working I can’t risk playing a moldy tape. It’s sad as there are several marked as Bulls games from the early 90’s that would be awesome to have as the original broadcast.
 Link for anybody interested

                              <span>it felt outrageous of me to pay any amount for Caddies or a NAS when the pandemic has bitten way into my budgets for food even (can get real hefty if you just want to check and move data across more than one HDD at a time, and involving a NAS for spare HDDs i shuffle around and forget i&#x27;ve got felt unecessary.)
 so i thought: hey, considering all the ports on a PC that a cable can convert to SATA from (eSATA, USB) why don&#x27;t i get going with an external HDD library? it&#x27;d make a neat decor, and i&#x27;ve got a spare PSU. would that work? seems to me like yes. yes it does. i might get fancy and build a Jedi Library looking rack for my spare HDDs to be on display, for looks and ease of access, instead of shuffling them around in boxes.

                              <span>Hi, 
 Is there any tool to clone and backup multi repositories locally and maintain these up to date? 
 The idea is to hoard and archive several open source projects on my server, in case they are removed, such as what happened to youtube-dl few years ago.
 Any good apps out there? I only know this one gickup, but documentation is pretty much inexistent and don&#x27;t seem to understand where stuff is cloned into

 I saw a guide recently on how to make a selfhosted jellyfin automated server with docker on linux. I decided to make a guide for us Windows noobs, and how to selfhost the entire process on your own computer or windows device. 
 I tried to walk through the entire process as if you&#x27;re a complete noob like I was! Let me know if you like it!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have used Nginx Proxy Manager for a while now as a reverse proxy and to manage my SSL certificates, for items like my own static site and Jellyfin, and I never have much trouble getting it to work. I&#x27;ve decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I&#x27;m having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.
 Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver&#x27;s docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:
 version: &quot;3&quot; services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID&#x3D;1000 - PGID&#x3D;1000 - TZ&#x3D;America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 
 I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let&#x27;s Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:
 Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server&#x27;s IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes 
 When creating a new SSL certificate:
 - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains 
 All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed
 The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I&#x27;ve set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I&#x27;m unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I&#x27;m completely out of ideas.

 Lan Subnet 192.168.100.0/24 Web Server IP is 10.10.10.10 and can be pinged by the Lan Subnet . 
 I want to redirect whatever whatever traffic the clients on this subnet TO an https web server with the IP 10.10.10.10 or it is domain . 
 I wonder 🤔 How to do that ? Can proxy do it ? I would redirect all the Lan traffic to the web server ? Any good Toturials ? Thanks

                              <span>Hi All,
 My docker is running out of space rapidly with only a few containers running.
 Any idea what is taking up all this space in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir and how to remove uneccesary files ?
 Qbittorrent has downloaded a few files but these are going straight to NFS share on my Truenas.
 Sureley the other containers dont need to use this much space ?

                              <span>Here is the situation, a few VM on Proxmox on an i7 64GB. Root disk is a 1TB Nvme. Also a 2TB sata disk for data. 
 An ‘old’ (was brand new but replaced by the 2TB SSD) 5400rpm WD blue has been repurposed for backup connected via a USB-C (2 disks) dock. I don’t know if it’s the 5400rpm speed or the dock throughput but I had to ratelimit backup as it was messing a Win10 vm. It’s still not perfect, backup take 12 hours for a 100GB disk. I am looking for a few solutions : - put 2 SSD in the dock (ZFS ?) - Buy a 5 disks USB dock with 3 or more SSD (ZFS ? Again) - Or... As many are complaining about these USB docks buying an old 1U disk rack on eBay. There’s so many options on eBay that I need someone kind enough to point me on the right product. Obviously there’s no 1U disk rack which can be connected via USB so it will be Ethernet and as far as I understood these have a CPU which means a OS so are file servers (correct me if I’m wrong). Can someone point Me to a cheap solution or another way of seeing things. Thanks for your help v.

 I knew it was used for file sharing but I had no idea how much it does, so in case there are any other people like me that missed the memo on everything Nextcloud offers here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve discovered and in the last 24 hours:
  
File sharing. This is obvious but I want to emphasize how seamless this is. Nextcloud provides an interface similar to google drive or one drive for managing, uploading, and sharing files, and it works perfectly. It makes managing user permissions easy and finally gives me a way to share a link to files on my server. No need to try and get people to m…</span>

                              <span>Hello!
 Not sure if this is the right place to post, so apologies if not!
 I ran into an issue with the new Portainer update with the new UI. The font wasn&#x27;t working and it came with this ugly serif font instead, however weirdly enough it displayed the font when Portainer wasn&#x27;t accessed behind my reverse proxy
 With lots of googling I&#x27;ve managed to fix it to allow the font to load behind the reverse proxy!
 In your nginx reverse proxy security config under &quot;add_header Content-Security-Policy&quot;, add the following &quot;font-src * data: blob &#x27;unsafe-inline&#x27;;&quot;
 For me, because I use OpenMediaVault this config file was located under /etc/nginx/openmediavault-webgui.d/security.conf, however varying on your setup you might find the CSP line in another file!
 Just thought I&#x27;d make this post in case anyone else ran into this issue, as I couldn&#x27;t find anything similar on reddit quickly &amp; easily. Hopefully save yourself some time if you run into a similar issue! That&#x27;s all :)

                              <span>I started scrolling and came across umbrel. I&#x27;ve been toying with proxmox at my work while preparing to start hosting at home and now I&#x27;m wondering if there is any reason not to use it or any reason to use it over proxmox. 
 TLDR; tell me about umbrel compared to proxmox.

                              <span>I posted this over to /r/linux4noobs but wanted to see what you guys thought of this.
 I have been using a Synology NAS for a while now. In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.
 I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.
 I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.
 So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?
 I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.
 Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?
 The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don&#x27;t have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI&#x27;s or something like that.

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to host two different versions of NPM - one for my &#x27;prod&#x27; services, i.e. ones that I&#x27;ve thoroughly tested and setup, and one for my &#x27;dev&#x27; services that I&#x27;m still testing. I have two different docker networks - one is docker_prod and one is docker-dev. Both are going to be in different subnets by design.
 What&#x27;s the best way to have two different instances of NPM, one for each batch of containers within it&#x27;s own docker network? Right now, I&#x27;ve got 80/81/443 opened on my router and it points to my &quot;prod&quot; instance. I read about the --scale function but that seems to be for running multiple instances of a single container (i.e. for load balancing)
 Is there a clean way to approach this, or am I overthinking? Thanks for any help that is offered.

In other words, if I were to format the drive. Will password component stay intact? I am wanting to use the secure flash drive as a ventoy and a storage drive. I know that a ventoy can also be used as a storage medium, as I&#x27;ve tested it and it works. How would I go about restoring the secure drive if something goes wrong?

                              <span>Good morning,
 I’m now starting to explore the wonderful world of sql and databases.( if this questions is best suited for another sub please let me know) or link to a guide. 
 I’m completely lost on how to do this. I thought it would be simply since the database is already setup and populated. I cant figure out how to send a local DB to Grafana. I’ve tried searching and can’t find the answer.
 I have a navidrome.db that I’d like to use with Grafana.
 How do I publish the Db? 
 I’m running Ubuntu 22.04 and navidrome is in a container. As of now Grafana is not in a container and installed directly. (Was just testing it with snap) 
 Thank you in advance.

 Is there a (free) thing like that out there ?

                              <span>As the title suggests I&#x27;m looking for a home lab solution to block certain content on a network that would be suitable for even a basic ISP router. Maybe a pi acting as DNS with a content blocker for a specific Mac addr? 
 Backstory is my 18 year old nephew is using dodgy movie watching sites and such on the WiFi at his Nans and Moms house which raises concerns with the ISP and possible viruses. I&#x27;ve tried advising him so far from an IT Professional standpoint but he&#x27;s still playing the &quot;I know better&quot; card with his Mom and Nan so they want a solution from me to stop him doing those things on their networks as they don&#x27;t trust him to listen to what I&#x27;ve told him (and I&#x27;ll be doing it on mine but I already have better routers)
 Naturally because he&#x27;s 18 so software on his laptop isn&#x27;t an option so content filtering at a network level feels the best way to go.
 tl:dr - I need a method to block certain content for a certain device (or devices) at a network level as a software block can&#x27;t be installed on the devices

                              <span>Hello.
 I am starting building my home lab and I plan to have a 1 node k3s cluster to host a few apps for personal use, like NextCloud, Jellyfin, PiHole, etc.
 While some might say is overkill, I like the ease of deployment and management that k8s gives, using industry standard practices and tools like GitOps with FluxCD.
 It will also be a great way to increase my k8s knowledge and to play with tools like Prometheus for monitoring, Istio, etc, in a more real-life scenario. And will be a lot funnier too :)
 I also have an old QNAP NAS, that I use to store media and backups. Eventually, if I install NextCloud or Jelyffin in my K8s cluster, I would like to use the NAS as storage device.
 My main doubt right now is if I should get a new and more powerful NAS with like 8 GB RAM and a Quad Core…</span>

                              <span>I have a LOT of services i.e. Watchtower, HomeAssistant, FileBrowser, Duplicati, Cockpit, Portainer, Glances, Uptime Kuma, Pihole, Nginx Proxy Manager, Tailscale, etc.
 I know I can setup notifications within many of these services. And many of them don&#x27;t have notifications functionality built in.
 What I want is a tool that out of the box can scan log files for the services I choose and send notifications over whichever method I choose e.g. Discord, Email, Telegram, etc. This will break the dependence of the service itself having notifications functionality. Sort of like Zabbix, but with much more available templates that cover more services.
 EDIT: There are some must haves:
  
Web interface
 Easily available template configurations for different services like those mentioned above. I don&#x27;t want to have to tinker and configure the alerts myself.

                              <span>So this is kinda a weird one for me. I can run the install exe fine. I can also run the program fine from winefile on the physical server itself. When I try to do the exact same over SSH it completely dumps my Xserver. 
 I&#x27;ve tried running directly from wine command using display commands to push it one past current display or current display
 I&#x27;ve messed around with winecfg to try and push it through different windows versions.
 Wine desktop crashes it as soon as I try to run exe. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if I need to move the program directly onto the native server and attempt to call it from there. 
 Anyone have experience with this?

                              <span>Hi, what do you guys use as an lte Backup? I need some device I can pug into my network. My router (opnsense) is running as an VM so I cant blug anything in there and I dont really want to try it with my providers router. if I get a lan lte router I can probably work out the routing on the opnsense. Does anyone has some hardware recommendation. It should have a lan port and run smooth 24/7.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at things like Next loud, OwnCloud, SeaFiles, etc, but just wanted any recommendations or personal experience of what might work best. 
 Here&#x27;s what I have to pay with since migrating Plex to it&#x27;s own box (for better CPU and UHD file playback) I have an old super micro board in a 4U EMC Isolon case. Currently running 24x 3TB drives dual Xeon E5645 CPUs (12c/24t total) and 128GB RAM. Like I said it&#x27;s aging and now that storage has come down significantly I&#x27;d like to replace some drives for Plex and use some of these in RAID10 for a private/personal cloud. 
 My parents don&#x27;t get cloud anything. Their 2TB backup drive, when not misplaced, is about half full, so I shared my M365 user acct so they have that to backup to, but it&#x27;d be so nice to be able to host stuff for my family and parents/siblings. That way any time they need help recovering folks or logging in/accessing, we&#x27;re not resetting passwords or I&#x27;m remoting in to unlock, etc.. be nice to just send a link or have it as a mapped network drive or something. Yes their OneDrive is currently hosting the user files in Windows, but still. Something I&#x27;d like to get into just because. I suppose I could setup multiple instances to play, but like hearing feedback if possible.
 TIA

                              <span>Hello fellow enthusiasts,
 I am currently running a Dell R630 server, which I need to return. My plan is to buy a refurbished HP ProLiant DL380e G8 for dirt cheap (around 300 Euros) and move my apps there. They are not CPU heavy apps. The OS is Windows Server 2012 R2. Both machines are on the same network and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be any special configuration.
 The method that I&#x27;m planning to do is:
  
Start the Dell with Clonezilla as source
 Start the HP with proxmox installed and then a VM with Clonezilla as destination
 Make the migration and remove the source server from network.
  
Is this a valid approach? Is there any better way to do this?
 Has anyone encountered any Windows problems on the server migration?
 Thank you for your time.

                              <span>Not very happy with what i have because creating ipset firewall rules in openwrt is a little too involved and buggy for me and i sometimes get millisecond lag spikes while streaming to vr headset. Im planning to move from;
 dsl modem pppoe passthru &gt; xiaomi 4a gigabit openwrt router &gt; desktop and wireless devices
 to;
 dsl modem pppoe passthru &gt; optiplex(or similar) with i5-2xxx+ and intel i350-t4 nic running pfsense and nextcloud &gt; desktop and other wired devices connected to pfsense, openwrt router connected to pfsense for wireless.
 would this make sense? or help me achieve my goal of as little latency between wireless devices and desktop as possible? And because of the insane exchange rates and availability issues, can i cut costs on anything? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently in the market to purchase a new network cabinet! My current setup is one of those 1u or 2u wall mount jobs where the door folds down and holds the other 1u on the door. 
 Needless to say this is no longer large enough to house all of my equipment in it so I&#x27;m looking to upsize to a 15U unit. I&#x27;ve come across a few via my searches on the interwebs but cannot land on one that I&#x27;m certain that I&#x27;ll be happy with due to very mixed reviews in my price range.
 My specific requirements are:
  
34&quot; or less tall (so 15U)
 Needs to be 24&quot; deep (old brocade switch is 14.6&quot; alone and until that gets replaced, yeah)
 Needs to wall mount and not want to fold itself
 Cost $307 or less including shipping to Florida
  
What are your go to options? I found a &quot;Sysrack&quot; 15U that looks decent but ive read everything from its fantastic to its probably going to fall off the wall.
 Thanks everyone in advance.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve seen in the tech specs of the various servers that the Intel graphics is &quot;not support&quot; due to firmware or chipset limitations. I&#x27;ve read this as output over VGA is not possible as the devices use a Matrox chip that works with the iDRAC.
 Curious if anyone knows if the iGPU is still usable in software for transcoding or 3D access by software. I&#x27;ve seen lots of well priced R240s and R340s cross r/homelabsales so hoping someone might have a good idea of whether it&#x27;s still usable.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I run a plethora of Virtual machines running all different manner of processes and I need to monitor these services. 
 Since these processes have little standardization between them, I am struggling to find a solution to report process status. I run every OS you could imagine for various reasons (HAOS and other prebuilts are a pain) and they are all different types of processes from webhosts to game servers to file hosts etc.
 My plan is to have a web frontend that people can access to check the status of these various servers. I already have the login portal set up and hard coded a minimal webpage to list the services and their status in a 3-state icon. Running-Halted-Dead
 My plan as it stands is to have a python web framework like Django running to respond to http GET/POST for a status update on the webpage but this solution has proved to cause me more headaches than I would like to admit. CORS is a black box to me right now.
 Is there a platform agnostic solution to report the status of a selected process or group of processes upon http GET/POST? Even one for linux and one for windows would be better than what I have now.

                              <span>Howdy homelabbers.
 I been playing with my Lab and got vMotion up, however I don&#x27;t have anything for vSAN part. I looked at possibly grabbing another R420 or R620.
 My lab is currently made up of the following:
 2 x R420
  
E5-2450 V2 - 16C / 32T combined @ 2.50 GHz
 64GB of DDR3 ECC RAM
 Server 1: 4 x 300GB 2.5&quot; 15K Dell Savvvio SAS
 Server 2: 2 x 2TB 7.2K 3.5&quot; Dell Constellation SAS
 Server 2: 2 x 3TB 7.2K 3.5&quot; Dell Constellation SAS
 ESXi 6.7 U3 Dell EMC
 6 NIC&#x27;s Total
  
1 x R720
  
E5-2680 V2 - 20C / 40T combined @ 2.80 GHz
 128GB of DDR3 ECC RAM
 8 x 240GB 2.5&quot; Kingston A400 SSD
 ESXi 6.7 U3 Dell EMC
 4 NIC&#x27;s Total
  
1 x OptiPlex 7050
  
6th Gen i5-6500 - 4C / 4T @ 3.20 GHz
 32GB of DDR4 RAM
 256 GB Toshiba NVMe + 512 GB SanDisk Ultra SSD
 Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
 1 NIC
  
RPi 4 Model B 8GB Model
  
1 x 200GB Emtec SSD
 3 x 500GB 7.2K 2.5&quot; Toshiba HDD
 OpenMediaVault
  
UDM Dream Machine Pro
 TP-Link 5 Port Switch
 I heavily use the RPi for NFS Datastores and house the ISO&#x27;s there. But I would like to get something going for vSAN. I looked into StarWind VSAN Application but it&#x27;s only 30 Day trial.
 So yeah. Looking for suggestions on best way to go about adding something to the lab for vSAN purposes. It can be physical or virtual solution.

                              <span>Hello homelabers,
 This is a long post so if you&#x27;re not interested to help, just skip this post. (Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this is permitted in the sub, but looks like there is no rule mentioning not to ask for help choosing parts)
 As the title mentions, I need help picking parts for my upcoming server. Now before you jump at me, I have read the subreddit hardware guide but I&#x27;m not looking for a business server as it would be too loud.
 So, I have already chosen some parts (correct me if there is something to change to the existing chosen ones). Now, the CPU, Motherboard, and RAM are missing (the rest I will figure it out).
 The CPU would need to sustain at least this load, and a good overhead for future proofing, since I&#x27;m planning for keeping this around a long time (4-5 years) and more services will pop-up.
 The motherboard, well, I just need it to accommodate the basics + HBA &amp; GPU
 The RAM, I would need it ECC, since I would be running TrueNAS (in a VM). 32gb should be fine but 64gb would be grate.
 The rest (CPU Cooler, Case, PSU, Fans) I think I can figure it out myself. 
 Any help is appreciated and have a great one!

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m pretty new to this homelab stuff is please forgive me if this question is too basic. I did some searching about power on this forum and found a lot of guys quoting large numbers but the info on the setup was lacking.
 I am currently looking at acquiring a HP Proliant DL580 G8 4x Xeon E7-4890 4x 1200w and running a project that hopefully will eventually end up with it being maxed out (Lots of virtual machines).
 Now maybe I&#x27;m reading this wrong but according to the specs it says that each processor can pull 1200 watts max? Which checks out with the unit having four power supplies?
 My doubt is that since this is a home setup your average room&#x27;s plug/circuit maxes out at a 1500w pull. Which means if each processor goes above 25% usage then it will blow the circuit. 
 Does this mean that people who run these out of their homes have massively beefed up their office/lab wiring to deliver all that power, or does the server just not actually pull that much at normal/low operation? 
 I&#x27;m happy to start off slow and just run one VM or two on the server while I figure out the power issue, but I&#x27;m trying to get an idea from you guys if I need to upgrade my houses wiring (since I do plan on maxing it out eventually), and if I do need to upgrade the home then how much do I realistically expect to draw with it running at low utilization at the beginning when I am learning? Would one plug be enough? An extension cord from another room and have two power supplies plugged in each?
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>For my entire IT career I&#x27;ve worked lower level jobs with the added bonus that I got to keep as much retired hardware as my wife would allow. Over the years I cobbled together some impressive bailing wire and duct tape solutions to accomplish what I needed to accomplish but I&#x27;m finally in a place where I can afford to spend a little money on my network.
 Goal: Centralize storage and management of media (and other things) at my parent&#x27;s house. They have the space and a rack and we both have fast enough internet connections that a VPN tunnel works fine. I have a firewall at my house capable of acting as the host side of the tunnel and all I need on their end is a docker container.
 What I&#x27;ll be running:
  
Some local storage for Plex - I have about 6 NAS drives ranging in sizes of 1 to 4TB (sets)
 Plex Server - Agnostic on how this is accomplished, I&#x27;ve done it as a Windows and linux VM, wouldn&#x27;t mind trying a container
 VM to run VM and gather content
 Docker container for VPN tunnel
 Future - CCTV and storage?
 Future - home automation functionality
 Future - Some light VOIP stuff
  
I&#x27;ve worked with both Hyper-V and ESXi in the past, wouldn&#x27;t mind giving ProxMox a look since I&#x27;ve heard good things.
 What I&#x27;m trying to figure out:
  
Where I should be looking for used/referb equipment.
 What I should be looking for spec wise.
 What is the best way to accommodate 6x 3.5&quot; drives.
 
Am I better off looking at a separate appliance for the drives
  
Thanks for the ideas.

                              <span>While upgrading to an R720XD with disk redundancy, I quickly realized that you cannot directly passthrough a ZFS pool to VMs under a Proxmox server.
 I&#x27;m now facing the following options:
 a) Keep managing the ZFS Pool in Proxmox, and deploy a File-Sharing Container that mounts the ZFS Pool and re-exposes it via SMB or other protocol.&gt; Not a big fan of this option, as it seems kind of hack-y and doesn&#x27;t really allow the maximum performance if I need my VM to use the ZFS Pool to it&#x27;s full extent.
 b) Install TrueNas Core in a VM and manage the ZFS Pools from there (Pool HDDs would be directly passed-through to that VM).&gt; This seems like a cleaner solution, but leaves me with a question mark in regards to where I should host the various apps I want to run (Plex, *arr stack, Nextcloud, etc.). Would I want to use the integrated apps from TrueNas? Run them in a docker inside the TrueNas VM? Run them as a separate docker in Proxmox?
 Does anyone have a suggestion or a recommendation on the subject?
 I&#x27;m still kind of a noob in regards to homelabbing, only been at it for a couple of months, so my apologies if these seems like obvious questions!
 I might also be looking at this all wrong in regards to ZFS Pools and Apps under Proxmox, so feel free to correct me if it&#x27;s the case!

                              <span>Im curious if such a thing exists. The way I imagine it working would be in conjunction with a reverse proxy. Basically anytime someone types in &quot;service.mydomian.com&quot; the connection will initially be blocked. I would then recieve a notification on my phone or an email saying something to the effect of &quot;111.111.111.111 is trying to connect to service.mydomain.com&quot; and then provide the options of &quot;Trust, Allow, Deny&quot;. 
 ​
 I like the idea of having yet another layer of security on my internet facing services. However from what I can tell things like Authellia would work just fine for loggining in from a webbrowser, but most of the things I have hosted are used through a companion mobile app and from what I can tell Authellia or others wouldnt work in that scenerio. 
 However if the Authentication was done on a secondary device and was completely invisible to the mobile app then I imagine it would work. Such as if I had a friend that I wanted to let use my server, they would download the app and try to login. On the first attempt they will just get an error that says they cant connect. But then I would get notified of the attempted connection where I can choose to permanently trust their IP, Allow it once, or Deny it. Then they try to login again and are able to connect. 
 ​
 Does something like this exist? Or is there a better way and I&#x27;m just way overcomplicating things?

                              <span>Hi!
 I have a domain with DNS through CloudFlare that I host at home. Recently, I&#x27;ve noticed a huge spike in requests, over 600,000 the other day, and 100,000 in the past 24 hours. I&#x27;m not too concerned, but it got me thinking. CloudFlare doesn&#x27;t provide me with much information since I&#x27;m not paying for their subscription.
 So is there anything out there that I can use to monitor and keep statistics on the web traffic?
 It would be cool to see what subdomains are getting hit the most, or how many GET, POST, etc requests are being made, and potentially seeing what is being exploited.
 ​
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve never set up or done anything with ddns before so I&#x27;m trying to follow a guide online but this guide just showed me how to do it for a single sub domain. 
 Do I need to create a ddns rule for every single sub domain and root domain? Or can I just put * as the sub domain and it will apply to all A records of that domain?

                              <span>Let me preface this by saying this is my fault for not reading the fine print, not the ebay seller&#x27;s.
 I bought a set of four 600GB Toshiba AL13SEB600 sas drives to use in an HPE Proliant DL360 G6 server. I didn&#x27;t read the part of the description that says &quot;these drives are for NetApp Servers&quot;, figuring any old 2.5 sas drive would work. Unfortunately all four drives give me the orange &#x27;drive failed&#x27; light and don&#x27;t show up at all in the P410i raid card config menu. I know the slots and raid card are good, since the original 72GB drives still work fine. So it seems that the seller was right that they can only be used in a NetApp server (or they&#x27;re broken, which I have no way of knowing). The thing is, I&#x27;m pretty sure from the datasheet that these are not special drives or anything, they should be regular old sas drives.
 Edit: I forgot to mention, the DL360 G6 datasheet does say that the server can handle a maximum of 4TB (8x500GB) storage, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the problem, since I&#x27;ve connected over 5TB of mixed drives, including one 3TB drive, and it&#x27;s functioned without issue.
 Which leads me to my question. How could drives be configured in such a way that they work on one system (netapp), but completely fail at the hardware level in another (HP)? Beyond that, how can I reformat them to work in my HP server (assuming they&#x27;re actually functional)?
 Sorry if this is a dumb question, I&#x27;m very new to enterprise type stuff and I didn&#x27;t see anything helpful in my quick googling.

                              <span>I&#x27;m specifically thinking of dnsmasq. I know a lot of consumer routers use dnsmasq for DNS and DHCP, so maybe that&#x27;s why, but if I have a separate DHCPv6 server I don&#x27;t know why I would want it advertising itself as a router.

                              <span>I recently acquired an Optiplex 5050 MT (with the quad core, 8 thread i7 and 16gb RAM) to start my homelab. Previously, I had Home Assistant running on a Pi 4 4gb but wanted to move that to something larger so I could use one machine for more than just that.
 I&#x27;m running Proxmox, and so far have Home Assistant OS and MineOS currently running in their own VMs. The only other thing I wanted to do is install pfSense to use as a router/firewall for our network. Would this system be able to handle all of this? I&#x27;m looking at going up to 32gb of RAM, but are four cores/eight threads enough for all of those things? I just want to make sure any of those VMs wouldnt be bogged down by the other. 
 Currently, MineOS has 2 cores and 8GB RAM, HA has 2 cores and 4GB RAM. I was going to do 1 core for pfSense and 1-2GB RAM. The Minecraft server is mostly idle except for maybe one night a week when my buddies and I get on, which is usually at most five of us. HA doesnt ever seem to use much CPU.
 I&#x27;m looking at NICs and am looking at Intel ones since I know theyre a bit better and require lower CPU usage. We have 500mbps internet and may upgrade at some point to gigabit. 
 I&#x27;m new to this all, so any help is much appreciated. Thank you so much

                              <span>I didn’t realize the hack job that was done to the room I had my servers in but needless to say I didn’t like it. 
 That led me on a quest to do it right so today we installed 2 x 20A 120V circuits to the area my server rack lives in. 
 I’ll never need that much power but I can pull 2000 watts if I have all of my servers and gaming PC going at the same time. 
 I’ll also have one outlet open after installing the 3rd UPS in the rack for things like a soldering iron or heat gun that I use on occasion. 
 Now I can sleep better at night.

 Picture of the replacement battery from Eaton&#x27;s website
 My coworker had a 5S1500LCD lying around and said I could have it as it was bound for the decom pile. I pulled a battery out of a new Eaton 5S1500LCD and verified it was working. As far as I know, just needed a battery.
 If I were to order 744-A2166 from CDW, does it come with the cable and connector? Or will I find out that I&#x27;m suppose to transfer over the wires and connector? 
 If it doesn&#x27;t include the cable/connector, which connector is this called?
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dipped into the world of selfhosted services a few times before but never had a deeper need to selfhost applications for a larger audience in a semi-professional environment.
 Nontheless, now I want to offer a cost-efficient solution for planning and streamlining communication on a project for 10-25 people. Concurrent access of all users is very unlikely. at most 5-10 people will use the services regularily at any given time
 Nothing&#x27;s set in stone so far except for software. Drive space requirement &gt; 500GB
 I&#x27;d like to use 
  
OpenProject (used on a Synology DS via Docker before) for project management and scheduling of tasks
 
Nextcloud for file sharing (integrated in OP)
 
synapse / matrix to channel user available chat apps on one single platform.
 
 I have three options for hardware:
  
Synology DS with an Atom C3853, 32GB ECC RAM (but slow internet access)
 
Intel NUC with Celeron J4005, 4GB of DDR4 (can be upgraded to 8GB and relocated for faster internet access)
 
or investing ~400$ in a new Odroid H3 / H3+ , 16GB RAM and 2 SSDs for RAID 1 (moved somewhere else for fast internet)
 
 All services must run through a VPN tunnel, so a VPN server would have to be hosted on the machine, too.
  
The cheapest and easiest solution is def using the NUC but I am not sure whether the J4005 can manage at least those 3 services within docker / portainer.
 
The Synology has a faster CPU and tons of RAM and HDD space but cannot be relocated somewhere else for faster internet.
 
The Odroid H3 / H3+ has by far the best CPU and offers M.2 and 2x SATA for internal Raid 1 but means a bigger investment.
 
 What would you recommend and why?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Specs: Sony Vaio SVE141L11U Originally installed Win8, and now it have Windows 10 Pro Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3110M CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz Installed RAM: 4,00 GB (3,88 GB usable) System type: 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor.
 Hello, there, I’m searching for some advise, I’m a Mac user with some old experience in Windows too, So I’m able to install normal OS without much troubles in both. 
 I’m currently use Plex on an old MBP that I have using like a media server and I use remote access to operating it from my new Mac through screen share, so it’s been very flexible and easy for me. 
 But now I have anoter (more old) windows notebook that I could use as a media server. The thing is, if it could run Plex in good condition as how it’s now, or should I install some older version of Windows, or even should I install another dedicated server OS to run my media stuff (video and music) and maybe as a file backup too, but hopefully with an easy remote access tool. Plex is really flexible and simple because I can play my stuff on my chromcast and managing in the web app too.
 So that’s the question, should I keep the windows 10 version and install Plex server, or should I use other OS and/or Media server APP?.
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>Hey all,
 I love this community! Over the past few months I&#x27;ve gone from simply running Plex on my desktop to picking up a r720 and learning Ubuntu server with docker and now rocking Plex/arr&#x27;s, Seafile and HomeAssistant. I&#x27;m now trying to better understand security and best practice while accessing my server remotely. Since you all here are smarter than I, I&#x27;m hoping you can point me in the right direction on a couple things.
 ​
 The Goal: VPN out of my workplace, connecting to my server/home network via OpenVPN and sTunnel on port 443. Tailscale, L2TP, etc are all blocked at work.
 ​
 Current Setup
  
Currently port forwarding to my server. I don&#x27;t have a reverse proxy. My knowledge of security is limited hence this post. Maybe this is the better way to do things?

                              <span>Hello. Today i ran into problem of multiple users managing one docker container. I have binded folder to a docker container. However i specified to run the docker container as specific PID and GID so that every file that has permission with given PID and GID will be transfered to docker container&#x27;s environment with it&#x27;s internal set of ownerships.
 However, when my friend add file to the binded folder of docker container, he have the ownership so inside docker container, the permissions will be shown as (eg.) 1002 and 1002.
 So i would need to tell the docker container to accept files from multiple UIDs and GIDs and so make it owned by internal set of ownerships. Can i simply just put 1001,1002,1003 inside the UID environment variable? (I don&#x27;t think so)

                              <span>Hello, I just recently started getting serious about self hosting and trying to learn as much as possible in the process.
 As stated in the title, I generated SSL certificates for my domain for my self hosted web server. I did this about a year ago, and it was great.
 I just moved this webserver to something more stable and when generating the SSL certificate I expected having to revoke the old one or something of the sort (maybe having to copy the old ones to the new server). But nope, let&#x27;s encrypt just let me request a certificate with no issues. Is this normal?
 What is preventing someone else from creating a certificate for my website?
 I am perhaps misunderstanding the goal of the certificates.
 Any pointers or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>My reasoning is power at the data center is 15% of what I pay at home. I move from a half rack to a full rack and lose the 8u in UPS space that I have at home. Data Center has UPS and back up generators. 10 gig fiber, 1 gig provisioned. Am I crazy?

                              <span>Hi all, thought I&#x27;d ask here as there are so many options and I&#x27;m a bit lost. Warning, this is a long post in order to explain the requirements exactly.
 I have an Unraid server and within it a folder where I back up all my photos.
 These are photos that I initially edit in Lightroom in my computer. I store them into year folders, and then it time-sorted subfolders. So the structure looks like this:
 2019 --1 Paris --2 London --3 Helsinki 2020 --1 Edinburgh --2 Lyon --3 Hamburg --4 Stockholm --5 Garden party at John&#x27;s 2021 --1 Mary&#x27;s wedding --2 Camping trip --3 National History Museum 
 and so on...
 This structure lies in my computer where all the photo editing is done, and I keep an exact backup of all the files in an Unraid share, unsurprisingly called &quot;Photos&quot;
 I also have an Nvidia S…</span>

                              <span>Every time I set up any technology (Home Assistant, Automation, Networking, etc...) I research and learn about it and set it up. Then a year or two later when it comes to upgrading or troubleshooting I have forgotten how to use any of it. I don&#x27;t remember where I found the guides that helped me set it up in the first place.
 So I started keeping notes about anything that I set up in a Google document. This has already saved my bacon several times but the document is getting a bit unorganized. I&#x27;m wondering if a Wiki may be better suited to keep all of this organized? Here are a few things I&#x27;d be looking for:
 ​
  
Some sort of first page &quot;Table of Contents&quot; feature that shows all of the topics and subtopics. Since this is rather focused I don&#x27;t want to use search functions to find my entries.
 Very strong formatting options (especially headers, styling, and tables)
 Good screenshot/image support (including being able to see the original size)
 Easy to use on desktop and mobile.
 I will mostly use this just myself. However, it would be a bonus if I could give access to certain sections of my wiki to other users. I rent out my home when I&#x27;m traveling and would love to give access to certain sections to my manager so he can fix things while I&#x27;m away.
  
​
 In general do you guys think a Wiki engine would be good for something like this? And if so do you have any recommendations based on my requirements? 
 Really excited to learn more about this!

                              <span>I have Tailscale up and running on Linux. I created a subnet route to access my containers running inside the docker bridge network. I can communicate with the containers via their IP Addresses. But since Tailscale is not installed on the containers, they don&#x27;t have a domain name and, hence won&#x27;t appear in the machines list. Is there a way where I can access them via domain name instead of IPs?

 The features I want:

 get payment using stripe
 affiliate
  
Is there any self-hosted alternative to Gumroad? No hits on Google.
 A cheaper alternative is flurly.com but isn&#x27;t self-hosted.

 During my self-hosted journey, I had many doubts about how to do it the best way. I was curious how other people have made theirs, so I created this survey. This is mainly directed toward those who have hand-built and configured a media server, but everybody is welcome to take the survey. I&#x27;ll post responses once enough are collected. I think it will be really interesting to see what&#x27;s most common. Here it is: https://forms.gle/XGdeW3f8WZc1hwtx9

                              <span>Ive been using Googles Calender for a while now, because I like the Interface and sync across my PC and my Phone. But its Google stuff so..you know.
 Im certain there are plenty self hosted Calenders out there, but Im a pretty visual person, I need a decent interface. Which is why I love stuff like Plex, Bitwarden, Pihole, they all have great Webinterfaces.
 And as I mentioned with my phone, it would need to be able to sync across devices. Wether or not that happens in realtime over a constant sync, or only once im home over Wifi in the local network doesnt matter too much.

                              <span>Hey all. Looks like there&#x27;s never been a drought of photo gallery questions on this sub, so forgive me for adding another to the pile.
 I&#x27;m still on the search for a good photo gallery that I can use to view photos on a NAS that stores all of my family&#x27;s photos.
 My requirements:
  
Works with existing filesystem, ideally read-only; does not impose its own structure. Since multiple people use this NAS, photos are not neatly rooted in one &quot;photos&quot; folder, but spread across the filesystem. I&#x27;m fine with having to manually navigate to those folders, though.
 HEIC support. Unfortunately, everyone else except me uses an iphone so this is a must.
 Fast UI even in a folder with lots (100s) of high-resolution images. This means not requesting thumbnails or other info until an item is actually in v…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 is there any good way on how I could monitor my HDD health (hours, bad blocks, pending sectors) ?
 I know that there are some tools which can check this, but I am looking for something that would do it automatically and if something was wrong it would unmount that drive, or it would for example send notification.
 Currently I would use DietPi, and something in docker would be a welcome addition. But in future I hope I can build some proper NAS which would do this in it&#x27;s software (like truenas or something like that).
 Thanks

I have the URLs of the profile, as well as the URL&#x27;s for about 30 photos, but it won&#x27;t load. How can i recover them? logging into the profile is also out of the question, unfortunately :(

                              <span>Where do you guys get HDDs from? I am talking about EU, as I cannot find any deals as good as the ones in the US where you can get drives for as low as 14$/TB. Ha! I checked used marketplace in my country, where drives from 2012 or 2014 are going for 28€/TB! Talk about deals here lol.

                              <span>Background: I shoot a lot of 16mm cinema film, and the telecine files I get are huge. A 100&#x27; reel at 24fps gives you about 2.5 minutes of footage. My telecine files for that 2.5 minute reel are typically about 85GB (6.5k resolution, HDR). As one does with analog film, long term preservation of the film itself and the original telecine files is important. I&#x27;m looking to burn these video files to BDXL MDISC and keep them offsite, to help support the 3-2-1 rule.
 Question: What is the best type of marker to use when labeling discs for long term archival storage? I know Sharpies are a no-no because they fade with time, but how about something like a Sakura Pigma Micron Pen, since they claim to be pigment based and archival in nature. Is something like that chemically safe to use with the MDISC without threat of damaging the disc over a long period of time?
 What do you recommend one uses?

                              <span>Just curious what is the best place to buy NAS drives? All the reviews on Amazon and even directly on WD.com say the drives are shipped loose bouncing around in the box without adequate packaging and arriving with problems. I&#x27;d love to buy local buty nearest microcenter is 1h30m away and doesn&#x27;t have the drives I&#x27;m looking for

                              <span>So the limit of what I can carry in a 2.5 HDD has arrived. Years ago I hoped not to hit the 5TB limit, but here we are. 
 It seems like my only option is either an external HDD with power supply and 3.5 (Will make it a CMR one), or an SSD. I know the shortcomings of QLC flash, but I usually use my HDD as Quasi WORM and do far more reads than writes unless I&#x27;m adding data. And do the 3-2-1 (well actually 4-3-2-1) backup rule including to WORM media. So it looks like the Samsung QVO is my only option along with its expensive (but still reasonable compared to years ago) price tag. Are there any alternatives?
 Adding in CFS so needing light travel packs when possible, it seems a 2.5 SSD will be my best option

                              <span>About 6 months ago I went through the (in my opinion) painstaking process of setting up backing up my personal NAS to BackBlaze B2. Ensuring that everything was backed up and properly syncing every day took some time but ultimately I was happy it was automated and working. In these 6 months, I&#x27;ve never had to use it in a real data-loss scenario.
 Until this/last month. For my local setup, I run Windows with StableBit&#x27;s DrivePool with data duplication enabled. While DrivePool is not a backup, it is a tool that should help me in a drive failure scenario. What it wasn&#x27;t configured for was what happens when 2 drives happen to die at the same time. Over the course of about a week I noticed my server getting slower and slower to respond, to the point where the system would lock up until I turned…</span>

 Using the integrated file system of macOS is one option, but it is hard having an overview of all documents. I know Bento for Mac was a thing but it seems that it is no longer developed. Is there any software like Bento who still exists ? A place where you can store all notes, documents, and emails in one place ??

This website (NSFW, contains nonsexual nudes) has a few thousand images but I can&#x27;t quite figure out how to download in bulk from it. I&#x27;ve tried WFDownloader and JDownloader, but I&#x27;m relatively new to using these tools so maybe I&#x27;m missing something. Anyone have any ideas or other programs I can try out? 
 You can have it load in a new photo every second in a slideshow format by using http://reference.sketchdaily.net/en/view/FullBodies?Time&#x3D;1 that link but I&#x27;m not sure how useful that is, as even if I could capture each photo it&#x27;d still take over half an hour to sift through everything.

                              <span>By any chance has anyone tried to put 8 fractal design hdd type-b cages in this case? I&#x27;m trying to find a 16 3.5&quot; HDD DAS case and if i could do some minor modifications to put 8 cages in this case I would be thrilled. It looks like the type B cages can mount to 120MM fan mounts and there are 4 at the top of the case. I can easily drill some extra holes in the cages unless you guys have something similar that allows stacking. Also with 4 fans up front and 2 fans in the rear I don&#x27;t think air flow and drive temps would be an issue at all.
 Edit: I should point out this will not have a motherboard. Just HDDs, Cages, two SFF-8088 to SFF- 8087 adapters and a power supply. 
 Edit 2: Added a picture of what I think might work from the top down. The red boxes are the Type-B Cages.

                              <span>I use and recommend both for non-RAID DAS. USB 3.0 is more than enough for hard drives.
 These are 2022 models, so can&#x27;t speak for the build quality, but I&#x27;ve been been using both older models for years. The oldest boxes are from ~2014. 
 Highly recommended. Considered getting some for the price, but I already have spares.
 *KNOCK WOOD* Out of eight 4 bay and two 8 bay, I&#x27;ve only had two failures. An easily replaced fan on one and the other one starting being flakey. 
 These are the prices they were several years ago before the USB-C models came out and the price jumped, partially because of product confusion between the old and new models.

                              <span>Bought an Elgato video capture device. Right now I&#x27;m using the composite inputs and transferring our old family home VHS videos to the PC using the Elgato software.
 ​
 I&#x27;m waiting for an S-VHS to transfer via S-Video however I read that the Elgato software isn&#x27;t giving me the best digital copy.
 ​
 What is the best software/steps to use to convert the VHS to digital? vDub? Something else? 
 ​
 What format should I be using? H.264/265?
 ​
 Any advice greatly appreciated. I&#x27;m completely new to this but I&#x27;m a fast learner.
 Thanks!

                              <span>i had acquired a kemp load balancer a while ago to reduce ports used for plex,websites music ect. got that working perfectly, now im trying to go do the same with Minecraft servers (renting them out to people if it all goes well (not promoting it just my plan)). 
 now the issue is when i enable content switching neither of the two servers that are set up and running are visible but when content switching is off it only lets you connect to the first server on either sub domains ive set for each. 
 is this a issue with kemp and if so is there any alternatives i can use or just a issue with minecraft hosting

                              <span>I want to expand my homelab but am running low on physical space to put servers in where noise is acceptable. My first thought was my crawl space, but there are a few problems which need to be overcome to pull this off like temperature and humidity control, access restrictions and cabeling.
 Cabeling for me is easy since the breaker panel and switching is right above it and just need new cables.
 The crawl space is hard to access but having some redundancy in disks and IPMI control on my servers will help out a lot since I don&#x27;t need to access it daily anyway.
 But the last big problem is temperature and humidity control. I placed a sensor which measures that and logged it for 5 months. In peak summer it never went above 24 degrees and now in autumn it did not went below 18. This is good since it is never too hot and hopefully not too cold even in freezing weather. There are also ventilation holes in case the lab produces too much heat.
 But the humidity! It never went below 95% relative humidity in the summer and in the last month 100%. I read trough the manuals of the hardware I have and it is all rated for below 90%. Hard drives won&#x27;t be a problem since they are helium sealed. 
 So I think this won&#x27;t be such a problem because humidity only condenses on cold surfaces and servers inherently get warm. Along with the heat it all produces it might push the relative humidity down and not be such a problem.
 I might also put a fan against the exhaust vents in case it gets really bad but I&#x27;d rather not because that will definitely screw with the house&#x27;s isolation since crawl spaces are for isolation of the house.
 Has anyone experience with a setup like this?
 location is the Netherlands btw. house is below water level but water never occurs in the space, it is just really humid

                              <span>I know this is vague, but I’m really eager to learn more. If I had to compare myself to others on here I’d say I’m a 3/10. I have a switch now, soon a Fortigate firewall. And a access point. I want to have a solid baseline of knowledge and learn more and more. What do you guys recommend? Maybe YouTube channels or online classes? I’d really appreciate the feedback!

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t purchased anything yet. I want to setup a camera system but I can&#x27;t get a wire from the router that is upstairs to the PoE/NVR/ ethernet Camera that would be downstairs (it&#x27;s too far and i don&#x27;t know how to do it).

 This is an example of a wireless bridge. I&#x27;m trying to decide between this and 2 powerline adapters given which has better connection/signal.

Have everything plugged into a UPS backup The one spot is saved so I can get a patch panel. It looks sketchy but It could hold me(approx 200lbs) so its not going anywhere. I cant wait to get everything properly setup and looking nice.

                              <span>So, I finally bit the bullet a short while ago and “UPSed” my homelab (some little details are at https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/pc91nq/graceful_shutdown_options_for_windows_server_core/, https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/pjwnly/new_to_apc_and_switchedcontrolled_group/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/plovhr/on_not_wanting_to_use_apcs_bloated_java_software/).
 I also took the liberty of making certain my cable modem and router were also on the UPS—and the PoE switch too of course.
 Today, for the first time in a long time, the power went out—and guess who still had Internet access for all their battery-powered wireless devices because the Wireless Access Points use PoE? Me ;) . It was bliss and everyone was so happy!
 (While I had originally tested a power outage scenario by shutting off the breaker when I deployed the UPS, there was no way for me to actually test what would happen with the Internet cable connection head end when the power went out in the neighborhood. That was, at least, until today.)
 Another win (and justification?) for our homelabs!

                              <span>Hey! 
 I have been searching for like 2 weeks and it really shouldn&#x27;t be so incredibly hard... Does anyone know a 3 or 4u case that meets the following requirements:
 - Redundant PSU
 - Can add multiple Noctua Fans
 - Supports EATX Motherboard
 ​
 I would think these incredibly basic requirements would be easy but wow... I think I am going to have to just go with a SuperMicro SC846 but wanted to try and find something that wasn&#x27;t just a NAS chassis converted to a high airflow system using a 3rd printed front-mounted fan mount.

                              <span>For folks who don&#x27;t know, Drobo is a NAS type device which creates redundant storage from a bunch of disks, but the key thing is that the disks don&#x27;t need to match in size. In fact, to increase the size of the storage, you can replace the drives one at time and let it rebuild between each swap, and soon enough you&#x27;ll have increased the size of array.
 My question is, is there any way i can implement this without a drobo? I&#x27;ve got a pile of mismatched 2.5&quot; drives which on their own are next to useless, but as part an array they could have quite a bit more life.
 For reference, I&#x27;m thinking about a case like this:

                              <span>Hey there 👋,
 I&#x27;ve been working on a small project that sorts out your Plex theme.mp3 files, especially for movies on Plex where theme songs aren&#x27;t sourced from Plex. Rather than using obscure bash scripts, and having to copy them manually whenever Radarr/Sonarr upgrades a file (because for some reason, they can&#x27;t just leave them untouched), this script keeps all your theme songs in one folder, and then symlinks them out to your media.
 Here&#x27;s my quite boring blog post on it (with a nifty tutorial including bad humour), the Github repo lives here, and the crate for the project is probably here. (When I get enough time, I&#x27;ll work on building the binaries using GH Actions, but I haven&#x27;t had the chance to yet)

                              <span>I recently started getting into self hosting in order to use services like nextcloud. I just found out that my ISP is using NAT for every home connection (aka no public IPv4 address), which means I can&#x27;t use Dynamic DNS to point my domain at my router&#x27;s IPv4 address. A static IPv4 address would solve the issue but costs an additional 5€ per month.
 My ISP does assign a public IPv6 address, so now I&#x27;m thinking I could use that instead. Would this public IPv6 address be static our would I need to use Dynamic DNS here as well?
 Does anyone have experience with this? I know only the basics of IPv6. Can my router translate internal IPv4 traffic to the public IPv6 address or do I need to change all my internal addresses to IPv6 as well?
 Thanks in advance!

 An error has occurred, Expired authorization.

 What gives? Is there something I&#x27;m missing/misconfiguring here? I tried google-fu but wasn&#x27;t able to find anything.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I&#x27;m new to Cloudflare tunnels.
 I&#x27;m trying to set a single tunel for *.home.domain.com
 Most tutorials I see are creating a tunnel per service or add multiple public hostnames to a single tunnel. I don&#x27;t really want to manage each service in Cloudflare and would rather have a single tunnel that points to my local reverse proxy which will then handle all the traffic dispatching since it already does for local network traffic.
 I tried numerous things but nothing works as I would like.
 All I was able to achieve at some point was to have a working service1.domain.com -- yet not even service1.home.domain.com -- but as I said that&#x27;s not what I want.
 Any ideas ?
 Thank you

                              <span>Basically what the title says. I honestly have no idea what I’m doing here. I’d like to be able to run plex or whatever a similar open source alternative is. I have an amazon fire stick 4k max, an Apple TV 4K, a few rokus, and a few tvs. I honestly doubt I’ll ever do more than a stream at a time. I just want it to be able to handle any file formats I throw at it, so sometimes transcoding might be necessary based on the device its streaming to. 
 If its smaller, quiet, and uses less power, that would be great. I use my MacBook Air m1 right now and its a pain because I have to keep it charged and leave it on (and make sure I disable the sleep function) which I’d rather not do each time. I just want something thats on when I need it. Wireless picture storage from Apple devices is also what I’d like it to be able to do. I have 1gb up/down fiber internet. What am I looking for here—an NUC? If so, which? Thank you so much!

                              <span>Hey! I&#x27;m a complete beginner to all things self-hosted, but I&#x27;m looking to set up a Matrix server on an Oracle Cloud free tier machine (not sure if that makes a difference), which is an ARM device. I&#x27;ve looked online for guides but none of them seem to work properly. I have no experience with docker or anything like that and honestly I&#x27;m just looking for someone to point me in the right direction. Any help would be massively appreciated, thanks &lt;3

                              <span>I am currently migrating some of my stuff from full vms to containers but i am not sure whats the best setup in therms of management. For the setup i am currently running multiple hosts (all proxmox) and my plan was to create a docker vm on each of them (ubuntu).
 The thing is I want to have the possibility to migrate a container to another hostsystem without changing the services local ip. (which would not be possible if the container uses the vms ip) 
 Whats the best way to do this/ Give every container its own ip adress? (also preferable its own nic with Mac adress that the change is auto picked up by pfsense)

 maybe one of you may help?
 here is my compose files
 services: gotify: image: gotify/server container_name: gotify ports: - 3080:80 networks: proxy: environment: - GOTIFY_DEFAULTUSER_NAME&#x3D;admintc - GOTIFY_DEFAULTUSER_PASS&#x3D;xxxx volumes: - ./gotify_data:/app/data
 networks: proxy: external: true
 Both are in the same network and I can open the gotify page but can&#x27;t login. login works when directly accessing the page. Its a clean install. I pasted the config from there docs, but then I get an error about self signed certs. Can someone help to configure NPM? Thanks.

 I&#x27;m looking for any application that has the capability to play preview on mouse hover along with the sound. I&#x27;m looking for something like what&#x27;s available on Youtube main page but I don&#x27;t need to skip ahead in the video.
 So far what I found as a workaround is QuickLook app for Windows. 
 Does anyone know some app that can do this?

                              <span>Dear selfhosted subreddit,
 I have a personal production server (Hetzner instance) to which I deploy my software almost exclusively with docker compose, including my Traefik reverse proxy and machine monitoring setup. I&#x27;ve setup a github ci/cd which:
  
is triggered on a push on a repository main branch
 connects to my instance with ansible
 updates the repo locally
 builds services over there on the server with docker compose
 deploys them with docker compose as well
  
The setup is working currently with not much issues, I guess. But my question is:
 Can I do better?
 I think I want to decouple the build and the deploy stage (eg build with github actions, push them on a registry and pull them onto the VPS) but I&#x27;ve researched the Internets and found nothing satisfactory for the automated deployment, except for doing that from within my ansible action.
 What I am imagining is something along the lines of Argo CD or watchtower but for docker compose, which knows when my containers are updated but also knows how to connect them to networks and volumes I&#x27;ve defined for them.
 Please share your ideas :)

                              <span>I am looking for alternatives to Minio, to host a S3-compatible object storage service in my network.
 Although I love Minio and it works great and I’ve used it for years, I recently needed it for a different project and noticed that when Minio is running, it prevents the hard drives used to store its data from spinning down. Sadly this is a deal-breaker for me as this server is used very infrequently and spinning the disks down is very useful to me.
 I don’t need any “fancy” requirement: no dashboard, HA, replication, advanced permissions, or really support for any operation besides getting/putting objects. Something simple and lightweight would do the trick just fine.
 Any recommendation?

 This started out with me trying to setup Nextcloud with Collabora, which from looking around seems to require a reverse proxy. That said, being able to type nextcloud.myserver and be redirected to myserver:8080 for all my various self-hosted apps has been something I have wanted to do for a while.
 ​
 Various research later and I seem to find answers suggesting that it&#x27;s possible, such as this post. However, I&#x27;ve been struggling to find any actual guides to get it setup (or at least guides simple enough for me).
 A couple of notes:
  
all my services are running inside docker containers

                              <span>I know that there are several open source Analytics alternatives, but which one is the most reliable? I’ve used one before (based on Matomo I think) and the numbers were different compared to GA.
 I don’t necessarily need a free solution. For example I could buy 66Analytics if it is the best one, but I simply don’t know which one to choose.
 Last question: some do not use cookies, so it isn’t necessary to have a cookies pop up on your site?

 Everything works fine if I use older versions of PostgreSQL.
 I believe the issue has to do with PostgreSQL 15&#x27;s new security features?
 I mainly plan on using this database with Nextcloud alone, for now. So, 1 app &#x3D; 1 instance of a database.
 I don&#x27;t need extreme hand-holding, but, does anyone know what commands I can use to allow me to bypass this new error from NextCloud when setting up my service for the first time?: Error while trying to initialise the database: An exception occurred while executing a query: SQLSTATE[42501]: Insufficient privilege: 7 ERROR: permission denied for schema public LINE 1: CREATE TABLE oc_migrations (app VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, versi...
 SOLVED:
 I placed a script in that .../nextcloud_db_scripts:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d:ro folder/volume.
 Here it is:
 #!/bin/bash&#x27; set -e psql --variable&#x3D;ON_ERROR_STOP&#x3D;1 --username &quot;$POSTGRES_USER&quot; --dbname &quot;$POSTGRES_DB&quot; &lt;&lt;-EOSQL GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO public; EOSQL

                              <span>So I have a really old laptop that doesn&#x27;t have a GPU and I wanted to see if I could salvage it as my home server. I tried to serve my movies and shows on the laptop and it does work but the thing is, the service I used (Jellyfin) was trying to process the video before playing it.
 I wanted to make a server that just works kinda deal. I am ready to manually encode the videos into some sort of type that runs directly without processing but I don&#x27;t want to wait for the video to load. Is it possible? Is there any service that allows video hosting without much server load?
 I am basically a new born when it comes to self hosting by the way, I just saw a couple tutorials online and used a debian server with docker to set up Jellyfin.

                              <span>Good morning beautiful Selfhosted community. 
 I&#x27;m quite newbie when it comes to networking and I need some help getting free reliable tools for the following:
 I need: Real-time Network Monitoring Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
 I would like a GUI that allows me to check which device (IP) is slowing down the network. Or just be able to know and see more clearly what is happening, on the fly.
 Sometimes internet might get slow and I&#x27;m completely blind, not knowing if it is an internal or external problem. 
 I do have 2 proxmox servers, I also have Kali Linux fully updated with all it&#x27;s stuff, but I still don&#x27;t know exactly how I can use it. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>ORIGINAL POST: One Traefik for public and private records on same public domain
 TLDR: can you fake domain resolution to specific IP of reverse proxy ? i.e. with hosts file ?
 ​
  
Hey everyone 
 So I recently had an epiphany and I hope you can help me to answer the uncertainty it has raised. 
 I use single traefik, with own public domain, for public and private dns names, both under same domain, as subdomain records. The only difference is that what should be public is on public dns (cloudflare) and what should not be accessible from internet, is on my lan dns (Adguard in my case). And traefik having dns challenge wildcard certs for my domain. 
 But what happens when someone finds out my public IP, and adds to their host file my ip and my(or try random) &quot;private&quot; dns record. Will it request from traefik my supposedly private url/page but from public internet? Since traefik servers those subdomains and it doesn&#x27;t care where request came from? I have even seen you can request a specific IP while requesting dns name with curl too. 
 So from security point of view, is it possible to access your apparently &quot;private&quot; dns records using this method ? 
 If yes, what is the best practice to separate public/private records under same public domain ? Use two traefik instances, or I have been looking for source IP restrictions for those private/lan requests ?
  
​
 Unfortunately haven&#x27;t got much responses at r/Traefik, let&#x27;s see what you think :)

 It can be free (as long as it&#x27;s still maintained). It can be paid (as long as there&#x27;s a self hosted option).
 Thanks in advance!

 https://github.com/ProtonMail/WebClients
 ​
 Obviously you would need some kind of syncing feature and I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s possible or if anyone has already done it themselves. Any Proton fans here? I&#x27;m trying to de-Google my personal data as much as I can after, well, I&#x27;m sure my story is a repeat of many here, heh.

                              <span>How can I have multiple copies of a container with a copy of the original volume? I want to test the pull requests for my repository and have a CI/CD job which creates a docker compose with a changed compose_project_name. But my volumes are still the same as in my production environment. Can I duplicate the volumes and name them after the build number or pull request, so I don&#x27;t write to the production files?
 The volumes are NFS. And just changing the path results in error because the destination folder doesn&#x27;t exist.

                              <span>Hello Hoarders!
 I have, for the past few months making a list of singers and bands whose entire discographies I wish to download. At the moment I have around 2100 artists. The way I was going to go about this was as follows:
  
Download the music videos
  Download each listed album in the playlists tab and sort them out by album in folders
  
This seemed like a great idea until I did the math and realized that this would require downloading around 30,000 albums each individually.
 Is there a better way to do this? I still want albums to be sorted into their own folder each.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am configuring my first home NAS, and am currently unable to decide what OS to use. My setup is 3 8TB HDD&#x27;s, a 512 gb SSD for the OS, and a 256 gb NVME for cache. I plan on adding 2 more 8tb drives in the near future. My use case for this will be a Plex server with a few Docker containers and a small SMB share. Unraid seems to be a great option, with the ability to expand your pools later on. While TrueNAS has ZFS and you don&#x27;t have to have a USB as a critical part of your system. The downside is I would not be able to add the drives to a ZFS pool when I purchase them down the line. I really like the idea of using Unraid but the USB thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about it. I&#x27;ve read some comparison articles but none of them have been able to sway me in either direction. I appreciate any help you can offer or guidance towards the correct decision.

 Samsung 850 Pro - 1TB (8.5 yrs)
  
They are now averaging almost 10 yrs in age. Should these just be preemptively replaced at this point? Cost is about $600 if using Samsung 870 EVO 1TB or 2TB replacements . 
 They don&#x27;t fail the same way that HDD&#x27;s do which is why I haven&#x27;t bothered until now but 10 yrs sounds a bit too long.

                              <span>I am trying to digitize the family vhs colection and I was following the great guide over at https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/is6hml/the_ultimate_vhs_capture_guide/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3 but I have run into a problem. During the capture the video will jump back and forth by several frames continuously. My setup currently is JVC HR-9500U → svideo →dazzle dvd recorder → virtualdub. I tested all the parts and they all work correctly. The vhs player plays the tap back correctly on tv, capture card can display the vhs play fine. Its just when the I capture. Is this a tbc problem? The JVC HR-9500U I have has a time corrector in it and I had sure it was on but still have the problem. Do I have to get another tbc? Attached in this post is a test tape i am using to get all the kinks out before i get the family tapes.
 Edit: would help if I added the video

                              <span>Basically what the title says. I honestly have no idea what I’m doing here. I’d like to be able to run plex or whatever a similar open source alternative is. I have an amazon fire stick 4k max, an Apple TV 4K, a few rokus, and a few tvs. I honestly doubt I’ll ever do more than a stream at a time. I just want it to be able to handle any file formats I throw at it, so sometimes transcoding might be necessary based on the device its streaming to. 
 If its smaller, quiet, and uses less power, that would be great. I use my MacBook Air m1 right now and its a pain because I have to keep it charged and leave it on (and make sure I disable the sleep function) which I’d rather not do each time. I just want something thats on when I need it. Wireless picture storage from Apple devices is also what I’d like it to be able to do. I have 1gb up/down fiber internet. What am I looking for here—an NUC? If so, which? Thank you so much!

                              <span>Yes, you read that correctly. The goal is to archive large parts of Discord.
 ​
 Why?
 It is important to archive a platform like Discord. Discord has replaced forums as a platform for exchanging information on specific topics. These forums are fortunately largely covered by e.g. the Wayback-Machine. The problem is that Discord is quite closed and can&#x27;t be easily archived.
 ​
 How can the whole thing be done?
 Me and a friend have thought about something. We have developed a website and a discord bot. Every server admin can index his server with the bot. On Search-Cord.com you can search all messages in a few milliseconds. The usernames no longer contain #tags so that no users can be contacted against their will.
 The current state:
 Currently we have about 20 servers with a total of about 3 million messages archived?
 ​
 What about opensource?
 The complete source code can be found on Github.
 What if someone does not want their messages to be in the archive?
 On the website you can autentify yourself with discord and then delete all messages from the archive and put yourself on a blacklist to prevent future messages from being archived.

I&#x27;ve heard of people using an SSD in one bay to store the os on so if that&#x27;s a thing and it&#x27;ll make the system more reliable I&#x27;ll gladly do that. Anyways I can&#x27;t find any non shady looking sellers on Newegg but I&#x27;m looking to get 6 SAS 3.5 HDDs. I&#x27;d like to get as much storage as possible for less than $150 per drive. Any recommendations ? If I have to choose between reliability vs storage size I&#x27;ll choose reliability every time. I appreciate any recommendations you can give.

                              <span>Cheapest I&#x27;ve seen them lately are about 70-75 dollars a TB.
 When you take into consideration, their read/write speeds cap at roughly 530MB/sec and the prices and performance of M.2 NVMe or the cheap TB Price of HDD ($13-15/TB) they have to be of the worse values out there for storage.
 Is it because they can fit laptops due to their 2.5&quot; form factor?
 Unless of course, I&#x27;m missing something obvious, would not be the first time.
 Please share your input, thank you.

                              <span>hey guys, there’s a website with about 300 recipes I’d like to add to my hoard. I’ve just been using the print recipe feature to make pdfs and it works fine, but I was wondering if anyone knows a better way than just doing this about 290 more times? 
 I’m not interested in archiving the whole website, just the recipes themselves. I’m willing to go through them all individually but I would rather not if there’s an easier way lol. 
 Thanks!

I think I&#x27;m gonna go for airsonic but what&#x27;s my best option since I want an active community too and not an abandonated place, is airsonic a good option? I&#x27;m planning to use a laptop as my host since I think my rapsberry pi 3 1 gb ram will be too slow , anyone can help? Thanks beforehand

I searched, and the closest thing I found is a personal crm but doesn&#x27;t do the graph thing, only kinda a database, and I would like to have something visual

                              <span>I asked this question in /r/proxmox but I wasn&#x27;t met with very friendly people there. So I will try again here.
 I have a physical router connected to a server that runs Proxmox. I wanted to switch to an OPNsense as a VM. Everything worked fine until I added another bridge which I deleted by now. I didn&#x27;t touch any of the existing bridges. This is my Proxmox network configI cannot reach my PVE from my OPNsense any more. My physical router has the IP 192.168.222.1 and within this subnet Proxmox is reachable under 192.168.222.16. OPNsense has 10.111.0.254. I connected all the networks you can see to the OPNsense except for the 192.168.222.0/24 (vmbr0). Right now no machine that has the OPNsense as gateway and not even the OPNsense itself can reach my PVE under 10.111.0.16 (this was possible before I created more bridges in PVE)
 In my other post I stated that I ruled out the firewall but if you would like to see the configuration I can post what you need to see. Do you have any idea what could have gone wrong?

                              <span>I recently got my server up and running, set up Nextcloud and stuff, and I would like to host a Minecraft server. I want to use a subdomain of mine to point to the server, which I have on Cloudflare. I know that Minecraft uses TCP, so I can&#x27;t use a normal proxy host, and I&#x27;ve heard you can&#x27;t make a stream host point to a subdomain, so is there anything I can do to make this happen?

                              <span>Recently I faced an &quot;issue&quot;, that I wanted to lock bitwarden under VPN, have HTTPS access to it, but still use my ISP for everything else.
 While OpenVPN user config file solved my selective (use this under vpn use this under ISP) problem.
 I was still facing the HTTPS bitwarden issue (you cannot use HTTP), but self signed certs seemed like such a pain in the ass to manage and get into, when I stumbled upon dnsmasq, and oh boy, did this transform my setup. (using Nginx proxy manage as well though)
 Choose any domain for your internal service, access it from any device anywhere while using OpenVPN (or I guess VPN&#x27;esque protocol of your choice), its like the time I discovered docker for the first time.
 So the question is, is everybody using it by default, or is it not being talked about enough?

                              <span>Hi people!
 I have a home server and a couple of laptops, and I want to periodically backup my home folders from the laptops to my home server. They&#x27;re in the same network.
 The home server has a zfs array, so the first thing that came to mind was to just have a systemd timer on the laptops that rsyncs (with --delete) the home folder into a folder on the home server, and another script + timer on the server that zfs snapshots that folder, maybe cleans up snapshots older than 30 days or so. But all this seems pretty low tech.
 Is there an established solution for something like this? I&#x27;d essentially like an automated backup with snapshots for last ~30 days. Or if you have some other backup scheme you deem superior, please share it with me.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a software, that can be used to synchronize between two systems. I would prefer for it to support file versioning and it should support hard links. I have used syncthing, but have found out, that all the hardlinks are broken after sync to the second system and therefore almost doubles up the used space.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had this working before so I have no idea why its not working now, but here&#x27;s my situation:
 I just upgraded my server and would like to try Nextcloud again as it was pretty clunky before. I&#x27;m running Unraid, and I install Nextcloud (it doesn&#x27;t matter which container, its all of them this happens with) with its own IP address (also tried on host net).
 I configured a HAProxy backend/frontend entry, same way I always do like the 30 other services I have, and the same way I did before when Nextcloud worked with HAProxy. Then, I have Pi-Hole running as my main DNS, so I enter my domain &quot;nextcloud.example.com&quot; in there and point it at HAProxy&#x27;s virtual IP, same as the other 30 entries.
 When attempting to visit the address &quot;https://nextcloud.example.com&quot; I receive the following error: 503 Service Unavailable | The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port
 I have tried directing HAProxy backend entry to both the HTTP and HTTPS ports and tried with SSL on and off, still receive this same message. Happens with every. single. Nextcloud docker container. I have not had this issue before, and the last time I played around with Nextcloud before the upgrade was about 6-9 months ago.
 Can anyone advise what I might be doing wrong? What I might be able to change? Or, if I am asking in the wrong place where I might be able to go to request assistance for this?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>What would likely be the lightest device power-wise that could handle:
  
Plex/Jellyfin client
 web browser or wine (for TV-based Kindle &amp; eBook reading)
 Bluetooth connectivity
 Ethernet/Wi-Fi (ideally Ethernet, even though that level of connectivity wouldn&#x27;t really be necessary)
  
Would this be something that just a Pi Zero could handle? or would it require something more robust? 
 edit: My bad, I meant Pi Zero W (just to make sure)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;d like to know if someone could help me, knowing that : - english is not my mother language - my network knowledge are really low level ^
 I recently got a fiber connexion at home with a Livebox (Orange ISP router). It cannot get a static public IP unfortunatly. 
 I own an Unraid NAS with all the *arr apps / plex / navidrome / etc... And I would like to be able to reach them easily. With my previous provider I had a static IP address, had bought a domain name (ovh) and I was able to get swag running on the NAS in order to reach my services as this :
 radarr.mydomain.ovh sonarr.mydomain.ovh ......
 What would be the best way to achieve it now that I have a dynamic IP ? As a noob, I think I need to get almost all steps not just &quot;use no-ip and configure your router as needed&quot; 😅
 Thanks for reading !

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wanting to do something like this for a while. Canonical has their Anbox platform to run android apps in Linux (like BlueStacks, etc). They also have Anbox Cloud that&#x27;s only available to enterprise customers. Cloud let&#x27;s you stream apps to your phone as though they&#x27;re installed on your phone and not the cloud. 
 I&#x27;d love to do something similar, self-hosted and open source. Especially with 5G, the phone can transmit data plenty fast enough. 
 There&#x27;s absolutely no need for me to have an app forced upon me every time I visit a website. No Express, I don&#x27;t need your app to track me, I just need clothes. There&#x27;s really very few apps that are actually worthy of hogging up memory on my phone (with no expandable storage). 
 I&#x27;d love to shove work apps (Outlook, etc) off to the cloud and off my phone, etc. 
 Any solutions out there like Anbox Cloud?
 Edit: I found a FOSS software called KDE Connect in the Play Store.&quot; I haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but it looks like it could at least get the job done for the time being and be a good launching point to build something dedicated for this purpose

                              <span>Hey guys, I hope you are well. Since many of us are running homelabs and of course self hosted applications ranging from routers to Blogs. How do you guys deal with UPnP on specific games such as Call of Duty. This topic already was posted on the Internet with varying succession rates. My old setup used to have ACLs for a specific PC on the network to enable the ports for CoD. Now, I know this may be a worse setup, but it works. The only problem is multiple devices cannot access the game&#x27;s servers without a &quot;Strict NAT&quot;.
 I would love to know your setups for such challenges and how you solved such issues.

                              <span>Long story short, my mom recently switched ISPs and because of that, Hulu thinks she’s in a different zip code, when she’s literally a block away from me. I’ve spent hours on the phone and live chat but either everyone is too stupid to understand the situation or Hulu doesn’t possess the ability to allow live for two different geographic cable markets. 
 So either me and the rest of our family (10+ people) don’t get to access live local networks or she doesn’t, because Hulu asks her if she wants to change her home location for the Hulu account. If she does, it changes the market for the account and the account then thinks everyone else is in the wrong location. 
 So what I want to do is setup a proxy or VPN on my network and point her firestick to it from her network. 
 Obviously my main concern is security. I’m not a big fan of opening an external port just so my mom can watch local news but.. she’s my mom so..I gotta. 
 Any simple and safe solutions?

                              <span>I am currently self-hosting a Bitwarden server with a Docker container on Windows, I am wanting to spin up a Nextcloud Docker container as well but am running into an issue with both wanting to use the same ports.
 I find posts saying the solution is a reverse proxy, but when further researching them and trying to set one up (nginx), I cant find a good step by step for what I am wanting to do, especially not on Windows.
 I have also tried Traefik, but again, I cannot find a guide I understand. Got the docker container for it going, but don&#x27;t know how to get 443 in there, and Bitwarden container wont start after it because Traefik is using the ports it wants.
 Any good simple guides on how to do this? Seems like it might be too niche to find, &quot;Dockers using the same port, nginx fix&quot;.
 I&#x27;m just so frustrated and lost.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on the selfhosted journey for about a year and half now. I&#x27;ve been using my old NUC (NUC6CAYS) with 8gb ram and 4-core celeron, mostly for its low power usage. However, It only has 1 sata port and 32gb emmc. I have several hard drives lying around that I want to use for backups and increased storage. Its specs are enough for me, and it remains idle almost always. I use syncthing, photo backup, pc backup, documents, etc.
 I want something that sips on power, and gives me more sata ports without breaking the bank. 
 My thoughts are:
  
a SBC with multiple sata ports
 a SBC with a HDD dock connected via usb
 helios64 which is expensive and is out of stock
 some aliexpress concoction

                              <span>I have a drive mounted via iscsi on my server. It randomly disappears, which shuts down Plex and a couple of other services. Is there some way I can have my server notify me when the drive disappears so I don’t find out when someone tries to watch something and Plex doesn’t respond?
 ideally, I’d like to figure out why it disappears, but as a stop-gap, the notification would at least let me restart the iscsi stack to get it back up and running.

 I don’t mind noise, so long as they have the 6 gig backplane, and can easily handle SATA drives. The product listing says “SATA drives require interposer cards (optional)” and that has me a bit concerned. 
 The price seems right, but I would appreciate some advice.
 Edit: these appear to have a 10 gig NIC, but the documentation specifically says “for interconnect”. Does this mean it’s not a normal NIC I can put an IP on?

                              <span>Hey All
 I thought I&#x27;d share my recent adventures in getting my homelab power costs &quot;under control&quot;. I thought it&#x27;d give some people a laugh, whilst others may get some ideas... and some may have some alternative suggestions.
 I&#x27;m in the UK, electricity costs started spiralling about 5-6 months, the government has basically borrowed a crazy amount of money to subsidise consumer electricity costs. From what I can tell, this has allowed it to be capped at £0.34 per KwH ($0.39 for folks in the US), which is still insanely high, and nobody knows where it will be in a year or so!
 My lab is fairly large, consisting of
  
5 Optiplex 5080&#x27;s as ESXi hosts
 2 Synology NAS&#x27;s with about (primary DS1621+ with 6x14TB, and a backup DS1821+ with 7x8TB)

                              <span>I am in the process of finishing my laundry renovation and finally have a place for my gear that isn&#x27;t in the corner of a bedroom or living room. 
 testing in progress
 While trying to migrate my unraid server from a full size tower to a HP prodesk G5 I was having issues getting the necessary bios changes to stick to allow the HP to boot from the unraid USB. I found every time I unpowered it to move it the settings reset for some reason. 
 I needed to change them in-place. I didn&#x27;t have any long display port cables so needed to bring my monitor in from another room. The only place I could sit it within reach of the prodesk was on the drawer that sits in between my stacked washer and dryer. Hail the Electrolux STA9GW, the true powerhouse of my setup. 
 Now I know many will be concerned with the proximity to a dryer. I am too, but my plan is to have a fan draw air into the cabinet from the side, away from the dryer. I also intentionally bought a heat pump dryer meaning not much heat or moisture actually enters the room. Very happy to get feedback though.

I want to create a mirrored ZFS zpool consisting of 4 8tb drives and 4 14tb drives but unsure of what to do to set that up without wiping the current unmirrored zpool and loosing all of my data. What sort of options do I have? The only ones I can think of are:
  
Is there a way to remove the 2 3tb drives from the unmirrored zpool 
 Install 2 14tb drives and 2 8tb drives
 Set them up with RAID
 Transfer data from the unmirrored zpool
 Add the drives to the new mirrored zpool
 
 Offload the data from the unmirrored zpool to another set of drives 
 Delete the unmirrored zpool and create a mirrored one with the drives I want.

                              <span>Pretty basic, but it’s nice to have a place in the rack to store screws, console cables, extra adapters, etc.
 Drawer is 2U from AC Infinity. 
 because you’re gonna ask, and so is the bot, the rest of the rack, from top to bottom:
  
Aruba 2930F (JL258A) for WAN connections and PoE. WAN comes from an AT&amp;T BGW320 buried in the back of the rack because Arris sucks and doesn’t make rackmountable gear. One WAN link to the house router (providing PoE), and one going into a dedicated interface and vSwitch on the ESXi box. 
 2U vented shelf with Aruba InstantON AP11D acting as a router for the home network (5 VLANs), a Lutron Caseta IOT gateway, and a Philips Hue IOT gateway (Both powered via PoE)
 2U Panduit 48-port Minicom modular panel modded to take the AC Infinity fan controller. Ports go to…</span>

                              <span>First of all...it is not finished. It looks like a mess but my whole house is in renovation right now, so there will be more work following, some more Cat7 drops, some cleanup, some fiber to the second floor.
 It all started with an old Fujitsu Dual Pentium 3, I think it was 14 years ago. 1GHz dual CPU, 2x120GB IDE HDD in RAID1. This got replaced by a HP ML310e, E3-1220v2, 32GB RAM, 7x2TB in 2 RAID 5 (3x2 and 4x2) arrays. Worked like a charm but wanted more power.
 So I got hands on a Lenovo ThinkStation P700, Dual E5-2650v3, initially equipped with 32GB RAM, transplanted 3 of the 2TB drives from my HP and stuffed 4 more 3TB in RAID5 into it. Upgraded it to 144GB RAM over time. Had some fun with it, then war struck and Europe had its fun with rising energy cost. Germany is pretty expensive…</span>

                              <span>In general what do you recommend upgrading first or better say have an eye on in an old office pc which is used as a nas server. 
 For me personal its a 1st gen Intel CPU (i5-760 4x2,8GHz) and 8GB DDR3 RAM. Bought 2 Seagate Ironwolf 4TB HDDs to now use this NAS to store all my data on and digitalize literally everything. 
 Keep in mind I and other users probably too don’t have a lot of budget.

I have built many desktops PCs but don&#x27;t know much about rack mounted cases. I see they come in 1U and 2U etc. What about power supplies? Thanks.

                              <span>While not too surprisingly my idea on unequal V-GPU splitting doesn&#x27;t look like it would fit my use case, my backup plan is 2 separate GPUs in my PowerEdge T620 running Proxmox. One would be for Plex transcoding and that is a well documented topic. 
 Question: Anyone have a recommendation (or maybe even one laying around) for a stupidly basic, low power, PCIe graphics card with VGA out, and preferably fan-less? I would be passing it through to probably a Debian VM. All I&#x27;m looking to get out of it is the ability to run a desktop on a monitor in my server rack and display a Grafana output. Is there anything with less capable cards that would make them a bad candidate for GPU pass-through? 
 Alternative option could possibly be a USB3.0 PCIe card with a USB to VGA adapter.
 I have a gigabyte GV-N210D3-1GI laying around that ill try testing with, but it&#x27;s probably more capable than i need.

                              <span>I get power flickers a couple times a week and I can hear all the UPS&#x27;s in the house click and go on battery power for a second or two. All devices continue to work without issue during power flickers (PCs, Monitors, Proxmox Cluster, NAS) but my core switch in the basement will reboot. I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s a load issue on the UPS or if it&#x27;s not of high enough quality to handle the load when switching over for that 1 second.
 The UPS is a CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD 1500VA/900W with ~450W loadThe switch is a Brocade/Ruckus ICX 6610 with both psu&#x27;s plugged in.Other devices on the UPS is 3x Lenovo Tiny and a DIY NAS running TrueNAS.All 5 of these devices are on a CyberPower PDU.
 ​
 Edit: Thanks for the responses. I believe the issue is the switch is just sensitive to the ups being line interactive.

                              <span>This past week I finally outgrew my dual bay Synology DS218 and have put the T410 back into production use.
 Normally I wouldn&#x27;t advocate for putting such an older system into production, but it was sitting in the rack turned off and used to be my production server.
 I&#x27;ve turned it into a Hyper-V host which is now hosting my second domain controller, a Windows 10 VM which is hosting backups, on the bare metal OS is now the Veeam server.
 Overall very happy with how the transition was made as while the T410 will be replaced with a Dell R730XD when I make the investment into the better platform for the 3-9 months which the T410 in service it only took ~$100 in parts to bring it up to serviceability.
 To prepare the T410 for the workload the following upgrades were made:

 Super easy to setup and configure, just wondering if anyone else has used it? If so what for, just basic stuff or anything cool?
 Also, looking to see if there are any alternatives that might be better. Want a bit of a try-something-new weekend
 Edit: got the title wrong. I mean Pomerium, not Prometheus

                              <span>Greetings,
 I got a new R620 (710 mini embedded) in my basement and put in 3 x WD Blue SSDs. I was able to power up the system, it found the drives, I created the virtual disk, initialized things, and then rebooted. 
 Now, all 3 drives just blink amber, and I get warnings on some little LCD screen saying something about &quot;PDR1001&quot;.
 I find it hard to believe all 3 drives went bad minutes after I built a raid, but I have no idea where else to look. I have no idea how to troubleshoot something like this, I can&#x27;t get into the OS and troubleshoot things since this is in a firmware raid. 
 I can get into iDRAC and it says the drives are in a &quot;foreign&quot; state. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Very new to this so please excuse me if this is a stupid question.
 I&#x27;m currently running 2 servers:
  
Dell R720XD (NAS with TrueNAS core)
 HP ML350 G9 (Proxmox VMs)
  
I&#x27;m currently running a gigabit network, however I&#x27;d love to have a 10gb link between my two servers so the VMs and server can have better bandwidth to the NAS. 
 Is it possible and reasonable to consider a direct P2P connection between the two using something like an SFP+ DAC cable? I&#x27;m considering this as I&#x27;d rather not cough up for a more pricey 10gbe switch.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been wanting to get a server for personal storage as well as a homelab environment, game servers for my friends, etc. but didn&#x27;t have the guts to pull the trigger until last week.
 I live in a studio apartment, but my closet is large enough to hold this without it taking up too much space. From top to bottom:
  
1U 24 port passthrough/coupler patch panel
 1U rack shelf with the Ubiquiti UniFi USW Lite 8 PoE switch
 Ubiquiti UDM-Pro gateway/router/UniFi OS Console
 Ubiquiti UNVR (currently not in use, just for testing)
 HPE DL80 Gen9 Server
 StarTech PDU in the rear
  
Waiting on an HBA card for the DL80 which I am hoping will tone down the fans which are currently unbearable to listen to. If not I guess I will have to upload custom firmware to manually control the fan speed (if anyone knows these servers well and can give me some pointers, please feel free to do so). Also, I know someone is going to gripe about the lack of a UPS... believe me, I know I need one. I just can&#x27;t afford to shell out $1,000+ on a quality UPS right now. It&#x27;s on my list.
 I&#x27;m planning on using the DL80 for personal storage (music, photos, videos/TV/movies), game servers for my friends and I, and a general testing workspace for new projects and services. Running Proxmox VE, planning on running TrueNAS and passing through the 10TB drives to it. Waiting on more drive caddies before putting in the last 10TB drive and a SAS SSD I got (also have a 500GB NVMe for OS).
 Let me know what you think, and any tips or pointers you may have for a newcomer!

                              <span>Let me explain... currently my Hypervisor is a Lenovo M93p Desktop that I got for free from work. Its a i7-4770 with 32 GBs of DDR3 RAM. Its dead silent and I&#x27;m not sure about the amount of power consumption it draws but it works. Out of the 8 VMs I run I currently have a 2 CPUs 2 GBs RAM allocation setup per machine with the exception of my minecraft server that I have give more resources but don&#x27;t have it running all the time. But what is considered overkill? I wouldn&#x27;t mind having a used PowerEdge or ProLiant but not sure if its worth having one. I was thinking if anything I would like something no more than 256 GBs of RAM, 4 CPUs 8GBs per host, and low power consumption like this.
 I guess this can be considered a &quot;what are your hardware specs&quot; but what are your thoughts on this?

                              <span>Hello all, 
 Please forgive quest and yes did searching but couldn&#x27;t quite figure an answer. 
 I currently have Comcast with 1gb service getting about 1200 for speed. The xb8 Comcast router has a 2.5gb port. 
 My home router currently is the xr500 but doesn&#x27;t have the 2.5gb port. 
 I would like to have at least 2 servers on 2.5gb speed. 
 Would I just need a router that can do that? 
 What would I need to get the 2 ports at 2.5gb?
 Thank you Bill

                              <span>My father was a big time record collector. He would literally skip meals for most of a week to have cash to buy a new vinyl record, as my mother tells it. He passed about 15 years ago, so his collection has sat dormant for awite awhile. One of his last gifts he got was a USB turntable. My brother doesn&#x27;t want the records and I don&#x27;t have the physical space. It seems that growing this collection was kind of his life mission. He would refer to anything non vinyl as &quot;Inferior music.&quot;
 My goal for now is to get his USB turntable, and rip every single album, so my brother and I can have our own little piece of the music my father sacrificed so much to afford. This will be a nightmare project. I ballpark at least 100 albums, and I&#x27;d be thoroughly unsurprised if it was closer to 200, and at a very conservative 30 minutes, that&#x27;s 50 hours of ripping, at minimum. If I do this, I want to do this ONCE. I replace my hard drives every 4 years, and I know USB drives and SD/Micro SD are famous for short lifespans, so I&#x27;m looking for something we could keep for as long as possible. I&#x27;m not looking for huge storage capacity. Ripping direct WAV files, this should easily take up less than a TB. I want to be certain we could play these for as long as possible though. My brother isn&#x27;t into music, and the music he is into he&#x27;ll just go to YouTube for. I have no doubt he&#x27;ll take the thing storing the music, throw it in a safe, and it&#x27;ll never see the light of day again. Another reason that having a long term format is very important. It&#x27;s going to sit there for a very, very long time.
 I&#x27;m considering Blu Ray-R discs, but there&#x27;s probably something better for this task. I also don&#x27;t have a Blu Ray drive, so that would add minimum $100 to the project. To those who are more informed about storage than me, any advice? What would you do in my shoes? Thanks to anyone who can help me

                              <span>I am trying to come up with something similar to those expensive DAS units that I can configure myself.
 I found a unit that even used BTRFS, but I would assume their &quot;gui&quot; wouldn&#x27;t include the same level of features as accessing the drives themselves.
 So, I wonder what options are available to build an external DAS unit that works over usb 3.2 and or thunderbolt 3/4?
 ​
 Alternatively, an external drive enclosure that supports raid 1+0?
 Also, would you recommend if going the enclosure route that I have an extra external drive to keep important files safe?
 ​
 What are your experiences with roadwarrior style for managing storage?
 I&#x27;ll have a large lithium battery to run this, plugged into the 12v on a vehicle. I don&#x27;t need much storage on the go, but I&#x27;d like to be able to keep VM backups and storage for video/photos local.
 I&#x27;m also likely to have the option for remote VMs, but this is a road I&#x27;ve yet to cross.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m in the process of digitizing a large storage of paper documents. I have access to good office printers, so scanning most of the standard documents was a breeze. But I&#x27;m having issues with larger format documents. Especially paper rolls (so about 3-4m x 80cm wide), but also larger DIN A0 documents (e.g. Blueprints, plans, family trees, posters, etc.). I checked local services, but they can only handle DIN formats, but not the rolls. Do you guys have any ideas on how I could digitize them in somewhat good quality? I was thinking of taking lots of photos and stitching them with photomerge in Photoshop, but that failed quite badly. Are there maybe some scanner apps specialized for this, or are there any other techniques than I&#x27;m missing? Thanks for any help in advance!

                              <span>First off if this is the wrong place or wrong question i am sorry ill look elsewhere.
 I have 2x3tb 2x8tb of growing data. All drives are external and really spread out , not sure the total actual data vs copies of data (future project) im looking to build a second PC for shucking drives in the future and build up a better setup. My question is what route should i go? Should i purchase 2 10+tb drives and put them into the new system and copy all my data over or just keep adding and growing my current setup. The 2 n 8 drives will go into a 10bay pc and be replaced once bay is full or drives die off. I&#x27;ve not played or tried any raid setup. Ive just been manually cloning the drives once a year.

                              <span>Hi all, I do regular backups of all of my devices, cards, and external drives, which a lot of the times includes tens of gigabytes of video footage (I do freelance videography work). I know I could most likely just delete all this footage after but as data hoarders understand, we would rather have a thorough archive of what we&#x27;ve shot, even if we&#x27;ll never use the footage again.
 I&#x27;ve recently started using Handbrake to compress some of my archived footage which has been great - I have projects that had over 100GB of video footage in them and compressing the video files has literally halved the amount of storage space needed for those files. The only downside is, the compressed files are brand new files and the old still exist. So the only way I can actually benefit from this system is if I delete the old files, which I&#x27;m hesitant to do since those original files have all the &quot;created at&quot;, &quot;modified at&quot;, and other data associated with the actual original creation.
 What I&#x27;d love to be able to do is use some kind of tool or process to be able to delete these files but automatically replace them with a little data file that contains all that info. That way if I go looking for the files someday in the future and I navigate to the directory I know they should be in, I can see the files that were there plus all the original data from them, but it&#x27;s just like a .txt file or something like that but which has the same name as the original file (different extension though obviously).
 Is anyone aware of something that does this or a workflow I could use to do it manually but in bulk? Any thoughts anyone has would be greatly appreciated! Cheers 
 EDIT: Forgot to mention, I have both MacOS and Windows machines but usually my backup processes take place on Windows so looking for preferably a tool/process for Windows, but can make Mac work as well.

                              <span>What sorts of data do you guys hoard? Statistics? Prices? Web scraping? 
 The reason I ask is because I want to start my own collection lab with a simple raspberry pi and mount it to some hard drives, but I’m not sure where to start or where to get real time data or if I’m looking in the wrong place. 
 Do you use premade software or make your own for these collections? What format of storage do you use and in what cases? What situational data do you include? Time of day? Temperature? Do you simply extrapolate afterwards?
 These are all things that can be done by me, and is likely a personal preference, but I’d love to hear what you guys think would be cool.

                              <span>I understand USB 3.2 Gen 2 can do &quot;up to&quot; 10 GBit/Sec. 
 What thought of speeds can be expected from pairing this enclosure with M.2 NVMe assuming its connected to the proper USB port. 
 At first hand it seems a bit of an absurdity but assuming a spare M.2 NVMe does it make sense?
 Thank you.

 I&#x27;ve read that 10GBE is a good idea for future proofing, but I&#x27;m not sure how this can benefit me right now since all I have at home is a Verizon Wi-Fi 6 router and my PC has a X570i Mobo with (2.5) Intel Gigabit Ethernet &amp; Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) (No more expandability on the Mobo, since the only PCIE port has my Graphics Card)
 I&#x27;ve also read that ECC RAM may be benefitial for this, not really sure how, since I&#x27;m ignorant on the subject of NAS &amp; ECC.
 I&#x27;m planning to buy 5 x 20TB WD Red Pro drives, since sometimes I find them for $350 a piece and they are CMR drives, which are supposed to be faster and more suitable for my purposes.

 Figure out SD card only survive around 100k write cycle 
 Found out that i basically downloading 4k chapters in like a week time Lets say 1 chapters is 20 page That&#x27;s at least 80k plus pictures no wonder it flashed my SD card 
 Now if i have 300 manga would it fried my tablet internal storage if i ask it to download to internal storage instead of SD card ?

                              <span>Hello datahoarders!
 I&#x27;ve been a lurker here for a while, and I really appreciate the informative community here. I recently purchased a Mac mini M1 with 256GB internal space and 16GB of ram, and I&#x27;m looking to use it for school, music production and leisure - it will be my main desktop. Therefore, I am in need of some storage. My question to you all is, how much do I realistically need to invest in to future proof myself? I know this is subjective, so I&#x27;ve conjured up some rough estimates of how much storage I&#x27;d need for the different purposes, based on previous experiences and future wants to give you a better understanding, I suppose. Here they are:
 ​
 I&#x27;m thinking of getting an SSD (Samsung T7) with 2TB:
 ~300GB of Music Project Files on Logic Pro X and Ableton Live
 ~1TB of Audio Plugins / Instrument Libraries
 That&#x27;s ~700GB to spare for other activities and such
 ​
 I&#x27;ll also get an HDD for things that don&#x27;t require a high read/write speed (I think?), my original idea was a 10TB WD Elements External Hard drive:
 ~2TB of TV-Shows
 ~1TB of Movies
 ~500GB of Music rips (from online purchases AND ripping my Vinyl-collection at some point)
 ~300GB of Audiobooks
 ~100GB of Comics
 ~50GB of eBooks
 That&#x27;s ~6TB to spare, for now
 ​
 Is this a smart way to go about it, or is 6TB wayyyyy too much space to spare? Are there better, or cheaper ways of doing this? I hope these questions are answerable, but I&#x27;ll happily expand upon anything, if needed.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Howdy everyone, I was hoping to get some suggestions/help with an upgrade I would like to make to my current setup. 
 Right now, its a mess, I have a CM stacker case with 5.25&quot; to 3.5&quot; adapters taking up the front, I don&#x27;t even have room for the power button, it is inside the case. I am using cheap pcie sata adapters for the extra ports necessary. I use stable-bits drive pool to manage the storage. I like drivepool, I do not like the trouble it is anytime I need to make a storage change, or find a specific drive... its a nightmare.
 so I have a Ryzen 2700x machine I would like to put in its place, but I don&#x27;t want to rebuild the storage the same way.
 since I have rackspace nearby, I would like to move the 10 or so drives into a hot-swappable rack mount chassis, DAS seems the way to go, so I have been looking at various DAS shelves on ebay. and it fits my budget but I have some questions.
 I figure I would be willing to invest around 500 into this, as with most things, if I can save a couple dollars I am ok with it. what would you invest in?
 how much trouble will I have getting my standard ntfs sata drives to show jbod without destroying the data on them on my windows server? 
 I have been a sysadmin for years, but I am quite unfamiliar with these DAS shelves.

 I wanted to upload my files to a cloud that I know my files there will be secured and not be worried of my account being hacked.
 Would really appreciate your suggestions.

                              <span>Hey Folks, 
 Need some help with my product knowledge on overhead scanners. I feel like I&#x27;ve dropped into a bit of an enthusiast black hole which is rare on the internet these days. 
 Keeping it simple - opinions fine -
 - why does the Scansnap SV600 still come up in conversations when it&#x27;s 10 years old? If the product was a success, surely Fujitsu would have released a new version by now? 
 - Is there a current reigning champ for overhead scanners? The SV 600 and CZUR seem to be the main two options, with the rest either a lot less expensive or having some kind of bespoke application that makes the product a little less appealing.
 I just need to be able to scan books and ideally product boxes that sometimes have more useful content than the threadbare instructions inside. 
 Thanks to anyone that can help.

                              <span>Hi All,
 A couple of years ago I used some bash scripting to download about 11,000 archive films off the BFI website in case they were ever put behind a paywall. They&#x27;re still available to view on BFI but are all now (and newer ones) currently inaccessible to download (brightcove cdn, not figured out how to get at it yet)
 ​
 It&#x27;s on DHT but I&#x27;m the only seeder and slow upload (~400KB/s) I just noticed some leechers on my Tixati client a while ago so looks like the meta got picked up.
 ​
 Can anyone help seed? You can view/find it here:
 ​
 https://bt4g.org/magnet/57e5b1aee0d46a0c6983ec62f2b6fa7b368d174f
 ​
 It will be a slow burn; I calculated at my upload speed it would take about 2 months to upload the lot.

                              <span>Hi, I am new to this subreddit and it looks like there is a lot of info about that which has been concerning me a lot recently.
 At one point I started to use OneDrive to sync some files that I don’t want to risk losing if either my laptop computer or my desktop craps out on me. In retrospect I think this was a bad idea as OneDrive did something I didn’t want it to do and gave me extra work.
 I selected to backup three areas which it insists the user keep synced to their cloud service which are desktop, documents, and pictures folders.
 I naively thought that when I select sync for desktop of one and of desktop on another computer that the files would be in the cloud separately attributed to the different computers. Instead it threw everything together on both desktop. I of course don’t need shortcuts to programs that are only installed on one to appear on the desktop of another computer. 
 Now if I keep the option to “sync” on on both of them, if I delete the shortcut on the wrong computer, it disappears from the other computer.
 Can anyone suggest a solution to bring it back to normal. I assume there is no function to “revert the sync” in OneDrive, so it seems I have to turn the sync off for both computers then sort out the files, then never to turn again.
 If anyone can give me any help and instructions how to do this or maybe how to keep the desktops backed up without something like this fiasco happening, please let me know.

The file contains only 76-120 games. The 800GB file consists only of unnecessary videos. I don&#x27;t recommend downloading it!

                              <span>My answer, I would guess about 6.83 kB, since we&#x27;d have 7,000 bytes of data, and to divide that by 1024 would equal 6.83 (truncated digits), since I estimate an average rate of 7 characters per word (6 letters with one spacebar after, sometimes in addition to punctuation marks).
 In old school computing, one byte of data has a 1:1 conversion ratio to ASCII characters, which consist of things such as letters of the alphabet, numeric digits, punctuation marks, spaces between words, and even starts of new paragraphs, which we sometimes call &quot;carriage returns&quot;.
 But now, let&#x27;s see if anybody else has a differing idea on how many ASCII/Unicode characters a thousand word essay would equate to...

                              <span>On top of it being crippled by terrible DRM I am inspired to go to my local library and scan these books myself. If anyone is familiar with these children books they have high quality picture photos of an assortment of objects and with the right lighting and scenery they are incredible to look at.
 The pages on archive.org have terrible glaring to them which hinder the ability to find all objects that is asked of the reader. I&#x27;d like to be able to check out these books at my local library and have them professionally scanned somehow, if it were a simple text book it wouldn&#x27;t be that much of an issue but given the detail of these books I&#x27;m hoping to do better.
 I called all of my local libraries too and all they have are simple flatbed scanners which wouldn&#x27;t be suitable for something like this and the DPI isnt high enough to capture every detail in these photos. Does anyone have any ideas for me on getting these books scanned?

 Look at the very bottom of the page to see all available books.

                              <span>Hello, everyone! Noob question: is there a good program/application for analyzing/health checking hard drives? What about formatting? Is there one program to do it all or do you prefer different programs for specifics tasks? I run Ubuntu but also have access to macOS as well. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just picked one of these up because I wanted something cheap for my plex media. 
 I&#x27;m attempting to add 4 10TB drives to it and having a weird issue. They all just show up in Windows 10 as &quot;Local disk&quot; and are inaccessible. The hard drives perform fine in o0ther machines.
 Im able to put other, smaller drives in the Syba unit without issues. Boots up fast and clean. But no dice on these 10TB disks. 
 Anyone with this unit able to help out?

                              <span>I have an array of 3 x 8TB HDDs in RAID 0 (mdadm) in my NAS/Server. I&#x27;m aware of the risks with RAID 0 (i.e. no redundancy and an increased risk of failure), but sadly I don&#x27;t have budget for another drive to add as a spare. I am nearing the end of the free space on this array, so a new drive will likely be required in the next ~6 months. I&#x27;ll have to make budget for this, as this is more a priority than adding a spare -- or multiple -- (unused) drive(s). I&#x27;m sort of &#x27;targetting&#x27; 32TB of data, eventually.
 I currently back this array up to 2 x 16TB WD Elements external drives. The two external drives are a RAID 0 (again, mdadm).
 I feel that having two (or more) external drives RAIDed together for offsite increases my risks of something going wrong. E.g. when being plugged in and unplugged…</span>

                              <span>My family needs storage for family photos, videos, and music. I&#x27;m trying to get away from cloud services, mostly because it seems silly to pay to use someone else&#x27;s computer to store our stuff. I was about to go back to an external hard drive when I learned about NAS options. I think this would work well for my needs, but I&#x27;m not tech saavy and have been struggling to understand what I would need and how to get it set up. I have Google Fiber in my home with two pucks.
 What hardware do I need? I&#x27;m under the impression I would need something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DS120j-DiskStation-Diskless-512MB/dp/B07ZKSLVT5?th&#x3D;1
 And then I&#x27;d need an actual hard drive to go in it, right? 
 How hard is the setup? Am I missing anything or is this just as simple as plugging into the google router and downloading the companion app on our phones/laptops? Are there any compatibility issues with different users running apple vs. android vs. windows, etc? 
 Thank you for the help, and if this has all been answered elsewhere, feel free to redirect me.

                              <span>Firstly I&#x27;d like to say I&#x27;m fully aware this community isn&#x27;t exactly meant for this type of post; I searched for GSmartControl subs, storage subs, SSD subs, etc., and I decided that this was the most appropriate sub out of all of the ones I was able to find. If there&#x27;s a more relevant sub I should have posted on, please comment it!!
 So, the question is, is my SSD dying?
 Screenshot of the GSmartControl Attributes Page
 The last time I checked GSmartControl was about 1.5 years ago, and there were no pre-failure warnings and I don&#x27;t recall &quot;old age&quot; messages either. I searched up things such as &quot;gsmartcontrol type,&quot; &quot;gsmartcontrol threshold,&quot; &quot;smart pre-failure&quot; etc., I even searched all of those terms inside of the GSmartControl wiki, yet I still don&#x27;t really understand what they mean or if my drive is actually dying.
 ​
 Do any of you Storage Gods know if I should be worrying/panic-backing-up right now? Thank you to everyone who read this far, I hope you&#x27;re doing well &lt;3

                              <span>For external HDDs they have (in similar capacities):
  
Ultra Touch
 One Touch
 Expansion
 Backup Plus
 Backup Plus Hub
  
All I need is a HDD which can backup 30-40 GB from a Windows PC everyday.
 Any ideas on the differences between the variants?
 Thanks!

                              <span>So, as I said, I&#x27;m a casual DataHoarder -- I have a bunch of movies, and do photography, so have a comprehensive backup system for client photos. But I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever really had a drive fail under normal use, obviously I have had drives fail ... due to damage (dropping, incorrectly wiring, disassembly etc). I&#x27;ve got an original WD Red 4 TB that is a pretty great drive that I use for my backups (WoRN), along with an external Drive for archiving. I also have a bunch of SSD&#x27;s and HDD&#x27;s that are basically whatever was cheapest/best value drives at the time (Plus Samsung Pro480 &amp; 850EVO SSDs). 
 ​
 However, despite having a bunch of drivers I&#x27;ve never had a drive really fail, am I just lucky, or are drive failures uncomon under fairly normal use?

                              <span>Curious what to do with this.
 Built a TinyMiniMicro from ebay with on hand ram/SSD.
 Dell optiplex 3070 micro , i7-8700T, 32gb+16gb SODIMM, 1TB SN550, 4TB 870 QVO
 I want to mirror the 1TB drive to 1TB of the 4TB and have 3TB unmirrored for things that don&#x27;t need redundancy.
 I&#x27;d like to do that on an OS that can do a 3+2+1 backup strategy with low/no maintenance.
 Bonus if the OS can hypervise (proxmox?) or host the NAS as VM. Double bonus for being bit-rot proof.

                              <span>Hi, Im running a home server with some services with no built in authentication that are exposed to the internet behind my traefik reverse proxy. Right now I have Authentik configured as traefik middleware to prevent unauthenticated access. Is this enough? What additional measures can I take to secure my services

I’m going on a work trip and can’t bring my cluster but want to continue configuring remotely if possible. Is there a way to run Helm and Kubectl commands remotely? Could Tailscale access the node IPs somehow, then I configure SSH?

 R710 4gb Ram 2x Xeon E5630 quad core CPU Rails, and front bezel and key included, along with at least 2 caddies (Copied from FB listing)
 R320 4gb ram E52407 Rails no front bezel 4 caddies
 Please let me know if I missed any pertinent information that would help in this comparison as I&#x27;m fairly new to these systems. Thanks in advance for your input.

 - My homelab setup in detail (including jails / VM&#x27;s run)
 - Thermal management (optimal temps, cooling server cabinet)
 - Power usage
 - 3d printing (3d printer in rack, custom 3d printed rack parts)
 First of all, hi, I&#x27;ve been reader-lurker for quite a while and that&#x27;s my first post - decided to share my little project with you guys :-)
 This is my Homelab in making. Open for some tips and recommendations :-)
 It will be a very long post with lots of &quot;random&quot; information - by random I mean I will share specs, my usage as well as my experiences without going to too much detail / keeping it condensed. Hope it will still be readable and somehow valuable :-)
 It&#x27;s based in boiler room that is next to my office. My PC resides in the rack and usb/hdmi cables…</span>

                              <span>So i finally put a smart plug with a power meter on after months of thinking about it. Now I’m scared to check the kW usage. All i know is it’s constantly at 150-160W range and i haven’t even used my dual 27” monitors yet. i don’t even want to calculate it for the month.

                              <span>So yes I got the Cloudflare email to get up to 4 Yubikeys at 10$ each.
 I looked at them and while I love the idea of owning a new piece of hardware that everyone is talking about, I can&#x27;t understand why I&#x27;d actually need it. Especially that it turns out the 5C NFC is actually 15 EUR, not 10 and shipping is an extra 5 EUR (not free). Plus maybe VAT and fees because I don&#x27;t live in the EEU.
 Right now, I&#x27;m using Bitwarden Premium. It has 2FA for every service that supports it. It&#x27;s on my iPhone and in my browser. Whenever a site needs a TOTP, Bitwarden automatically fills it in. Services that use SMS as 2FA suck, there aren&#x27;t many, and when they do that there is no option to use anything else than SMS anyway (or I&#x27;d be using Bitwarden for them)
 It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a hassle to get Bitwarden to enter the TOTP (on the phone or the computer), and I almost never receive the TOTP over SMS.
 So... What does a Yubikey do for me there? It doesn&#x27;t feel like I need one, and I&#x27;d rather avoid spending money just for the sake of it. What am I missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to upgrade to 10GBe fiber for my ESX lab. I have 2x DL360 g7&#x27;s each with a dual port Melanox 10GBe fiber HBA. My storage array is currently a PC with an ASUS Prime Z490-A intel motherboard. I tried to test fit one of the Melanox HBA&#x27;s in the PC but it didn&#x27;t seem like the mounting plate matched up depth wise with the case. I assume PCI-E is PCI-E no matter if it&#x27;s in a server or PC right? Anyway- what do you all use for dual port 10GBe fiber connectivity in your workstation class machines? I don&#x27;t want to drop money on a card I can&#x27;t use.

                              <span>I recently found this NAS which appears to turn on and have 8 bays. Is there any use I can give to it? It&#x27;s a little old I think from 2012.
 I don&#x27;t think I have a use for a NAS but is there a possibility to use it as a server O part of my lab?

                              <span>I just watched a video about this product and it looks pretty legit. I’m thinking about deploying in on a test VM to try it out. 
 Any of you currently using it? Or can offer pros/cons to this software? 
 I’m particularly more interested in the SPN capability and functionality. Is it even fast? I know multiple layer VPN won’t be the fastest but I don’t want to lag or wait forever for something to load.

                              <span>I want to start a home lab of my own but I have no idea where to start. Right now I just want to find a better home for my plex server since it&#x27;s been running on an external HDD dock (the whole drive just corrupted). I want to eventually make room for home assistant and CCTV storage along with anything else that will come down the line. 
 Is there a specific system that you guys would recommend or any other hardware that is beginner friendly? I don&#x27;t care too much about having the latest and greatest.

 Can I do this without exposing any sites and or using Cloudflare to proxy my IP? Or do I need to do that in order to hide my IP?

                              <span>I have a friend whose college network blocks certain connections, such as SSH or anything custom that uses SSL. I know enough to know that if I re-host the same service at the same port with no SSL, it works. This makes no sense to me, but does make me feel pretty uneasy since one of the things we use is a self-hosted voice/text chat server.
 I&#x27;ve been getting into self-hosting a bit and have looked at stuff like Pivpn for myself. But before I go experimenting and taking up this person&#x27;s college time, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has ideas for things that would be most likely to defeat this. I know that given the original problem, it&#x27;s possible that some or all VPN protocols might not work. I haven&#x27;t tried simply hosting the service on port 443, so I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re doing something special to monitor traffic. We did find that a particular text-based rmote access protocol is functioning fine, but various other secure connections are blocked. All of the above are using TCP and SSL. I have no idea what the firewall is doing here, but I&#x27;m unhappy that it&#x27;s forcing us to send things back and forth in the clear, so if I can fix it, I&#x27;d like to do so.

                              <span>Hey reddit!
 Just a refresher: almost a month ago I announced Fasten, an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 1000&#x27;s of insurances/hospitals/clinics
 Here&#x27;s a couple of screenshots that&#x27;ll remind you what it looks like:
 Fasten Screenshots 
  
Since then I&#x27;ve been busy having (incredibly thought-provoking) conversations with some of you, chatting with HIPAA lawyers &amp; professionals, and re-architecting the application to support zero-knowledge encryption. 
 It&#x27;s taken a lot longer than I expected, but thankfully the code is back to a state that is useable, but still slightly embarrassing :)
 Here&#x27;s a quick summary of the changes I&#x27;ve made:
  
Fasten has been rewritten/rearchitected to be a SPA/PWA.

 As the title suggests. I’m looking for good alternatives that let me and my small team remote into our work machines at home. 
 We use a lot of gpu intensive programs (blender, Houdini, nuke and resolve) and would like to have a smooth as possible experience. 
 We’re currently using VPN and NoMachine which have worked well, and we have been impressed with Teradici in the past at previous companies.
 VNC never produced fluid enough motions, and the fps tanked when we ran it through guacamole (which also filtered the image stream making it blurry)
 TeamViewer isn’t accelerated (when we tested it) and was also dog slow.
 Parsec doesn’t have a Linux version.
 X2go was kinda cool but also couldn’t deliver the speed we would like.
 We’re using xpra internally for some sharing of sessions for some tools. Which works great but it’s not a one stop shop for removing into our infra.
 I would ideally want to get rid of the vpn and instead have some kind of broker. 
 Anyone I’ve missed? I’m sure a lot have happened during the pandemic /work from home revolution.
 Also, I’m pretty sure we have not optimised our infrastructure sufficiently enough for remote sessions to be at its best. So any tips on how to improve beyond just software choices would be cool.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all, I wanted to try using Immich for my photos and videos but since it&#x27;s still in beta I want to be safe and also keep all those files mirrored with my already existing Nextcloud instance.
 they use different volumes, and I know that Immich use a different folder structure from Nextcloud, but I don&#x27;t care how it&#x27;s saved on Nextcloud I just want it to be there if Immich goes down and I can&#x27;t access my photos.
 For me it&#x27;s ok to have the same files duplicated, one in the Immich volume and the other in the Nextcloud volume, but how can I do it? It needs to be an automated thing, because when I add images at Immich I want those files automatically backuped to nextcloud (doesn&#x27;t need to be instant, if it&#x27;s done once a day I&#x27;m ok) 
 How can I achieve that?
 both application are on the same server, just different containers

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m just looking for ideas on the best way to gain external access to my services and also the best way to protect them.
 I&#x27;ve looked into wireguard to set up a tunnel but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s possible with my proxmox setup unless I install on the host which I&#x27;m reluctant to do.
 I have Heimdall dashboard which is accessible via dynamic dns but obviously I can&#x27;t access any services unless I gave each one its own ddns and port forward.
 I could maybe use Organizer dashboard as that shows everything in an iframe so should work.
 Any other ideas? Or best approach

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I would like to get recommendation on how I can improve my current setup.
 Here&#x27;s my dashboard.
 Setup:
  
Asustor NAS with 4x1TB HDDs in RAID 5 - used as my media storage.
 HP EliteBook 840 G1 (i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM)
 Nvidia Shield for my living room TV
  
My laptop/server is running Portainer with:
  
All of the *arr stack for media
 PiHole as the DNS server at home
 NPM for reverse proxy
 Uptime kuma - although I&#x27;m not doing anything special with it.
 Heimdal for the dashboard
  
When I first started I wanted to start small, so my goals were:
  
Successfully setting up the whole *arr stack to handle media properly. It took some time to understand best practices listed by https://trash-guides.info/
 Accessing my services locally using a host name instead of an IP.
 Having a dashboard to access everything easily.
  
Stuff I still need help with:
  
Monitoring. I have uptime kuma, but still haven&#x27;t figured out which services to watch, or how to make sure my containers are highly available/fault tolerant.
 
SSL everything. I was thinking about buying a domain and setting all of my services to it instead of the service.local setup I have currently. Any recommendations on this subject? I wouldn&#x27;t like to expose my IP to the internet, even behind a DDNS server so I saw Cloudflare has some solution. I currently use Tailscale.
 
 If anyone has any more recommendation, I&#x27;ll be happy to hear. What else can I safely host at home?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hey guys, I am using Bitly for business development. Their UTM campaign dashboard is extremely expensive. So I figured maybe I can use ILLA to build a self-hosted dashboard that uses Bitly&#x27;s API or just import the CSV. I want to use ILLA to build a UTM management tool that can do data visualization.
 I will keep posting my progress here. If I can use ILLA to build such a tool, I can save about $180 per month.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I&#x27;m trying to get Heimdall consistently displaying on screens larger than 1024 pixels wide. At the moment Heimdall streches my apps right across the screen. There is probably a way of doing this with CSS but I&#x27;m struggling. So far using
 #app .content { margin: auto; max-width: 1024px; } 
 Gets me the desired 3-column layout, but it leaves a big grey blank space to the side of Heimdall and adds a horizontal scrollbar.
 Is there any CSS solution for this?
 Many thanks!

 Which seems really neat, but also in the early stages. Are there any other similar control panels like this out there?

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I recently moved from Hyper-V to Proxmox, and was using Veeam community edition for backup. 
 This is not working now (tried adding the windows server as a physical server, but it just refuses to authenticate it, says it cant mount the admin share, which the user should be able to do... ie just wont work) 
 So looking for something else that truncates the logs ect. Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 Also, is anyone using backblaze? recommend? Best way to back up though Proxmox? 
 Thanks guys :)

                              <span>So, if I have a docker container running Nginx Proxy Manager, and that container redirects me to the other services via subdomains, is it necessary for every container to be on the same network? I got it working this way, but it is recommended to isolate every container to its own network for security reasons, but then, how will I access them?

 My end goal is to have 3 segmented closed off networks.
 I&#x27;m only using my opnsense bare-metal for vlan. It has a total of 4 ports: ix0, ix1, em0, re0.
 These are my current settings, basement for example: https://imgur.com/a/Fwyd4Qu
 All Assignments have dhcp configured, interfaces enabled. 
 When I plug a laptop in to em0 port, that&#x27;s assigned to vlan02, I can&#x27;t get a gateway ip via ipconfig or ip r on ubuntu. 
 I tried deleting opt1 thinking it may be conflicting, but I get the same issue.
 What am I missing here?

                              <span>This question is based on the specific container, DVWA.
 https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa
 ​
  
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students &amp; teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.
  
I notice that internet is available on this vulnerable image as it was set with bridge network mode by default.
 $ docker inspect web-dvwa -f &quot;{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks }}&quot; {&quot;bridge&quot;:{&quot;IPAMConfig&quot;:null,&quot;Links&quot;:null,&quot;Aliases&quot;:null,&quot;NetworkID&quot;: 
 In VirtualBox, I can have multiple network mode such as bridge and host-only?
 Is it possible to have similar setup in docker as I need Internet access for initial setup considering the limitation in the container (e.g. no ssh server, vi)
 Once complete, I would like to disable bridge and only use host-only / internal networking only without any access to the internet. 
 I also tried to change from bridge to host but didn&#x27;t work
 $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES abcd vulnerables/web-dvwa &quot;/main.sh&quot; 2 weeks ago Up 9 minutes 127.0.0.1:80-&gt;80/tcp web-dvwa $ $ docker network connect host web-dvwa Error response from daemon: container cannot be disconnected from host network or connected to host network $

                              <span>Here is my network rack in my new house. I ran at least 4 cat 6 drops and 1 inch conduit to every room. The equipment is a UDM pro and a 2.5g enterprise Switch. Currently have 4 access points and 2 cameras(g4 pro) set up with plans to add 3 more cameras an a doorbell if I can ever get my hands on one. I’ve got a 20TB hdd in the UDM pro for UniFi protect which records in 4k full time. Internet is 1g/1g fiber and failover 50/5 cable connection. The Dell computers on top run HyperV on windows server 2019 which hosts my Pinole dns, Plex, and storage(5TB 2.5 barracuda in each).
 How’d I do?

 Phillips Hue Bridge
 Asus RT-AX3000 in AP mode
 (Firewall)Dell Optiplex 3020, with an i5-4570 CPU, 8GB RAM with a HP NC364T 1gb Quad NIC
 Cisco SG500-52 switch
 APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 with extra battery pack
 (Server)Dell precision T7500, 2x Xeon X5650 2.66GHz, 48gb GB DDR3 1333MHz, SP 1TB SSD (boot drive, vm os drive), 2x 6TB WD Purple 5400rpm hard drives, NVIDIA Quadro P2000 5gb GDDR5
 (DVD Ripper)Dell optiplex 3010, with an i5-3470 CPU, 8GB RAM, Samsung SSD 840 EVO 750GB, NVIDIA Quadro P2000 5gb GDDR5, and 2 DVD readers
 Use cases top to bottom: Firewall is setup with dynamic dns and port forwarding for 2 services (will cover those at the server part) also has a split tunnel vpn setup with OpenVPN
 Server is setup with Proxmox for virtualization. I have an OpenMediaVault VM setup that uses the 6tb drives for its SMB storage. I have a Jellyfin server setup to mount a share from the OMV vm and to use it as its library. It’s port forwarded so friends/family/me can use it outside of the network to watch things. I also have a VM setup with Win10 LTSC that runs my YACReaderLibrary server, and that is port forwarded so I can read comics on my iPad without them taking up space on my iPad. This vm uses the SMB share to hold the comic book files.
 DVD ripper is there so I can rip older Fullscreen dvds and import them into Jellyfin to stream to my CRT TV. I have a Sony Trinitron KV-27FS120 crt that I watch older shows/anime/movies on and I use jellyfin and this to rip the dvds and stream them to my tv. I use makemkv and powershell with a custom gui to autorip multiple dvds at a time with this machine.
 And that’s the rundown for my homelab!

                              <span>I have an ESXI server running 6.7 and it&#x27;s always worked just fine, but as I get more evolved I have been getting bugged by how the VMs look choppy in terms of dragging windows and a slow delay on inputs. 
 Is there somthing special I have to do in the configuration to fox this? Do I have to buy a graphics card and allow pass through? I&#x27;m not trying to game on it or anything crazy, just want smooth respond time with my interactions. 
 I use VM workstation pro on my actual PC and the VM&#x27;s there run great. So I tried copying settings but no luck. 
 Any help and info would be appreciated.

                              <span>I’ve had my eyes on a Dell C4130 on EBay for quite some time now and I know that these bad boys are somewhat rare. 
 However. During the last three months I’ve been eyeing it, I’ve seen a price bump from GBP 1100 to 2000.
 In addition, I’ve seen this happening on a lot of other old stock inventory as well. Am I just unlucky or are hoarders trying to make more money in a down market?

 Improvised setup, located inside a storage room. Built with the cheapest hardware possible. It runs some minecraft servers, to reduce the load on my VPSes. I should definitively clean the cable mess.

Just posting this to say thanks! You don&#x27;t get paid to do this and everyone here is always ready to help at literally any time of day. Better than most tech support in my opinion.
 I love yall.

                              <span>Hey all, building my first home lab and I&#x27;m migrating my desktop to my rack. I&#x27;m looking for a server chassis that can accommodate a full ATX mobo and 285 mm GPU. I&#x27;m planning on using it as my own front facing hot swap bays would be a plus but are not a requirement. 
 Currently considering the SilverStone RM41-H08. Any other suggestions?

                              <span>New house, new homelab. And a way to display digital art that I’ve always wanted.
 Lots of Unifi, two racked Synology NAS’s running lots of dockerized apps as well as backups and camera NVR, a couple NUCs running Ubuntu to play with things, a raspberry pi cluster for the art stuff, Mac mini, Apple TV, a bunch of hdmi splitting and switching, a whole lot of Sonos ports, some multichannel amps, UPSs, cooling fans, and a lot of LEDs and wires. 
 Completely unusable by anyone else in the family oh well.

                              <span>I had an MD1220 chassis laying around, so I bought the MD3220i EMMs to do some iSCSI with Proxmox, but the drives I&#x27;m putting in show as &quot;Bypassed Physical Drive&quot;. The drives are on the compatibility matrix for the MD3220i, so I&#x27;m not sure what the problem is. I have tried starting the chassis in both split and unified mode, and the problem persists.
 ​
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Newbie Question: Just getting started and looking at 1u Short-Depth Servers (Max. 20&quot;).
 Possible option is the Dell PowerEdge R230 @ 19.5&quot; depth.
 Question: The front of the system has 4x Hot Swap drive bays. I assume these are the ones used to setup your RAID configuration. If so, then where does the Windows OS boot from? Other systems I am looking at have a NVMe M.2 slot on the Motherboard to boot the OS from. So how does it work on the Dell R230?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey guys.
 I&#x27;m building a Frankenstein drive testing rig (I sell lots of used drives on Reddit) and it&#x27;s getting an upgrade from the HP backplane that I have. I needed to expand into the 12 Gbps realm, and this seemed like a good choice.
 Basically, I need someone to probe the back of their backplane with the power on, and tell me what voltage they get from the gray power cables going into either the motherboard or the backplane. I *think* they are 12v and GND respectively, but I&#x27;d rather be sure before I blow up a backplane.
 So, please, if you&#x27;re able, can someone get me the readings? If not, I&#x27;ll risk sacrificing a board for science. XD
 Thank you very much!!

 What am i missing here?

                              <span>So little back story, there used to be this forum/website for our countrys rap scene that shut down in like 2018, but some parts of it is archived on the wayback machine. A big part of the content that was posted there like some songs that the artists dont deem worthy to be reuploaded to streaming and pictures of events has been lost. While it doesnt seem like the songs and videos have been archived by the wayback machine, the pictures are still there, so is there anyway for me to easily download them? I searched the sub didn&#x27;t seem to find a solution that fit me, just found some command line commands that download from existing websites and idk if it works for archive too or how to approach it correctly. I&#x27;ve done data hoarder for years but its been mostly downloading stuff manually, so ive got a big chunk of the &#x27;lost songs&#x27; from that site in my collection but i never thought about saving things like pictures too. My plan if i get them is to archive those pics on either instagram or tumblr so its more accesible for everyday users. Also im on mac if that helps anyone.

 I saw some pictures of a submodel indeed having that but I wanna make sure mine does to before I open the sucker up. But how do I know if it does? And how the heck do you find out which submodel it is? I can barely find any info on this aside from the useless manual and sites like this that list all submodels: https://fccid.io/RR-STX-SRD0FV1

                              <span>I’m planning to build an ITX NAS with the Jonsbo N1 case with 2x 8TB drives mirroring. Going to use OMV to do file/photo back ups, iCloud sync (with NextCloud docker), run an occasional VM and few services like AdGuard. No Plex or media serving. 
 I have a 2700X CPU available but would need to buy MOBO/32GB RAM. I could underclock and undervolt to lower power consumption potentially but I haven’t tried this. Alternatively I could get a i3-12100 along with a Z690 and DDR4. 
 Which route would you go given the choice?

 However, it turns out portrait images get rotated by 90 degrees. The only thing I could find about it is this discussion: 
 https://groups.google.com/a/webmproject.org/g/webp-discuss/c/tF_GGs5DBd8
 It doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s a issue with the viewer, because every viewer (browsers, apps) render the image rotated 90 degrees. Does anyone else have experience archiving images as webp?

                              <span>So I have loads of folders with dumpa from older computers over time. Most of them are just copies but with added files or newer versions of documents. These are all named with dates of when the dump was made.
 How would one merge these folders to a new folder with every unique version of files and discard the duplicates, with the goal to save storagespace and ease of browsing for content later?

                              <span>Hello Everyone, 
 I’m trying to build a new storage unit to move from my drobo 5C to something else. I was able to get a case with 6 drive bays and wanted to add more to it. I was hoping for some help and suggestions if anyone is will to help. 
 My drobo has 3 12tb drives and 2 8tb drives. 
 I want to buy 5 16tb drives and put them in my new case then transfer the data from the drobo to the new drives then move the drobo drives to the new case but I don’t have enough space for all those drives and saw some recommend 5.25 to 3.5 inch drive converters. How good are they and any recommend ones? I want to stay with windows and will probably use stablebit drive pool to manage the drives. Not sure what Raid to use with all the drives or how to manage 10 drives all together in these varying sizes. Any suggestions or changes to this I’m here to listen and see what to do. Any different way of using it proceeding with the drives is okay with me, open for any suggestions. 
 The case if anyone is interested is 
 Corsair Graphite Series™ 600T Mesh Mid-Tower Case from like 10 years ago.

                              <span>Does anyone know of any utilities or powershell scripts for Windows that would allow me to see how much data was written to a particular drive over a given time period? I&#x27;m trying to project how much space I will need in 6 months, 1 year, etc. Over a given week, the files written to the drive are pretty consistent, but there are hundreds of them and I&#x27;m trying to easily quantify them. Thanks.
 Edit:
 I figured it out using Powershell. I was going to delete the post, but figured I&#x27;d post the solution in case anyone else found it useful-
 &quot;{0} MB&quot; -f ((Get-ChildItem E:\ -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.CreationTime -ge &quot;10/2/2022&quot; -and $_.CreationTime -lt &quot;10/9/2022&quot; } | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum -ErrorAction Stop).Sum / 1MB)

                              <span>Found these at one of my local Targets, all 70% off. The 4tb game drive was $38, the 8tb were $60 each. No I won’t be shucking them as they are 99% likely SMR…also because I have a pair of 20tb WD Golds waiting for the NAS to be dug out of storage and those will be replacing my pair of 16tb Exos that currently sit in my desktop PC. The Exos will switch to being used for backup (most of my hoard is cold storage, write once read many). The 8tb drive will be headed to the PS5 and Series X for live storage so I can transfer back and forth to the SSD without having to redownload.

I need to get 2 more, but there is zero availability in my region. I can readily pick up a couple of Seagate Expansion 14TB (Model # STKP14000400). Any issues I should be aware of before mixing these drives?

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering adding an extra couple of drives to my main PC to max out the internal bays while I have an opportunity to jump on a sale, but I don&#x27;t want to risk killing something if I accidentally overload the PSU.
 It&#x27;s currently running a Corsair CS650M with this loadout (I chose &quot;Gaming Keyboard&quot; to play it safe, since I don&#x27;t know if my 2013 PS/2-attached Unicomp keyboard is as heavy on the power as I&#x27;ve heard original IBM Model Ms are, and one of the unnamed USB devices is intermittent use of an XBox 360 controller) and I noticed that it&#x27;s claiming I&#x27;m worryingly close to the rated 130W combined maximum for the PSU&#x27;s 3.3V and 5V rails.
 However, I also notice that it&#x27;s assigning 3W to the 5V rail per 7200 RPM SATA drive and 1W per 5400RPM SATA drive. Does that sound right for a Seagate Ironwolf and a couple of dissimilarly-sized WD Reds? The Seagate spec sheets only list the 12V peak load and I&#x27;m unclear if I&#x27;m reading it correctly that the WD spec sheets are trying to communicate that the 12V and 5V rails have the same potential peak load.
 If at all possible, I&#x27;d also like to leave enough slack to swap in my brother&#x27;s old GeForce GTX760 if my GTX750 dies before I&#x27;m ready to buy a new PC to swap my drives into.
 Can anyone provide clarity on the spec sheet side of things and is there a more suitable PSU calculator you would recommend?
 ...and if I am too close to the edge to pick up an Ironwolf Pro and a Red Pro on sale and a 2-port PCIe SATA card, would you advise a replacement PSU or can anyone suggest a trustworthy DC-DC voltage converter to supply them that shouldn&#x27;t be too expensive to get a hold of in Canada? My part-picking skills more or less stop at &quot;Check the NewEgg and Amazon reviews, and then google for a few more... possibly with the product name and the keyword &#x27;Linux&#x27;&quot;.

                              <span>Hey there hope you&#x27;re having a great day.
 Over the past year I have been building up my homeserver (ansible-nas base + lot of advice for setup lurking here :) ) and for the most part I am happy with it. 
 Though I do struggle with the &quot;proper&quot; setup of my storage-setup:
 Currently I use 4 SSD - 2 old 250GB drives and 2 new 1TB, which run in a ZFS mirror.
 I mounted my media files to the ZFS pool and for backup and system I use one of the old ones each.
 Putting the cloud storage for additional backups (3-2-1- rule) aside - does this look like a fair storage setup or is it something I should change? 
 Data on the backups are mostly pictures and music (+couple of old movies).
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>After adding an LetsEncrypt certificate to my domain, my website looks like in the screenshot below.
 I am using a Wordpress turnkey template (it&#x27;s still wordpress 5.x) on a proxmox server. The website is the default one which was pre-installed with the turnkey template.
 Since I am a newbie, I haven&#x27;t really got any ideas what to do. I can still access the website with HTTP just fine. Also tried different browsers &amp; devices (mobile devices didn&#x27;t work too).

                              <span>Hello,
 I hope somebody can help me with the problem I have with setting up a reverse proxy on my system.
 The system has 5 IP addresses (don&#x27;t want to get into details why) and the reverse proxy is working fine when the target webserver (same box, sonarr on port 8989) bound to to all ip address on the system. When I bind the interface for the target webserver to a specific IP address, I get 502 bad gateway (no changes in Nginx config). The website is still running when I use the direct IP address, it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore through the reverse proxy. 
 Any idea what could be wrong?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I want to create a VPN to connect my two remote devices (say A - Server, B - Client). Explored Tailscale and other services, but I wanted a server with the control over keys and config. This article helped me to setup a hub-spoke VPN with the hub on a VPS. But it had few concerns regarding security. Let&#x27;s say my VPS provider or an intruder, say X, manages to gain access to the server. Possible impact :
  
X can impersonate as a peer. All he has to do is switch Endpoint A&#x27;s public key with his key and restart wg and he&#x27;ll start receiving packets from an unsuspected client B.
 X can view the unencrypted packets as the hub has to decrypt and re-encrypt before forwarding packets between the spokes.
  
I was searching for some way in which these can be solved and I saw this article from the same person. To sum it up, there are two layers of tunnels, one hub-spoke as explained above, and another inner layer just between the two spokes through the outer layer. This kind of makes it a virtual point-point topology setup for the inner layer which adds its own layer of encryption. So with firewall properly setup in the peers, now if X manages to gain access:
  
X can impersonate as a peer in the outer layer, but his packets will not reach my peer&#x27;s inner layer as the private &amp; public keys of inner layer is never known to the hub(VPS). So effectively the incoming connection is rejected by wireguard (on wg port) and firewall (on other ports).
 X can view unencrypted packets coming from outer layer. But there is one more layer of encryption in the inner layer which makes it effectively E2E.
  
I believe setting up a hub-spoke this way will be safe and private on any VPS as long as the wireguard cryptography isn&#x27;t broken. Please comment if I&#x27;m missing anything here which could compromise this setup.

 I just got a good gpu and I was thinking of setting up really anything that can benefit from having a gpu.
 First that came into my mind was a private game cloud server, but couldn’t find anything that could be hosted from Linux.
 Any ideas? Cheers!

I&#x27;m thinking of getting a WiFi camera to place outside, and the software could take a picture of the site once or twice a day, at scheduled times. When construction is done, I thought it would be cool to have a slideshow of these pictures to show the progress.
 I&#x27;ve found Shinobi and Zoneminder, but couldn&#x27;t find this particular feature. Any suggestions or ideas?

                              <span>Hello my friends. I am a fairly new to self hosting and docker/portainer.
 Im trying to get an instance of ToolJets spun up via Portainer but I&#x27;m getting a little lost on the docker-compose.yaml.
 I use two directories. One to store my apps and then app database/data
 /mnt/apps
 /mnt/tankbox
 ​
 I was able to find this this yaml(https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/blob/develop/docker-compose.yaml). But I have no idea where to begin. I have launched other container but they were fairly simple docker-compose.yamls this one is a bit more entailed. Just need know what fields of the yaml to edit.

 Thank you Reddit!

Being mobile friendly is important, auto sync with mobile devices as pictures are taken (or maybe on next wifi connection) is a strong desire. Being able to share photos cross-platform (as in a link that plays nicely with text messages) is a requirement. Shared photo albums would be nice. 
 I started here. Thank you mods and contributors, this list is beautiful.

 PhotoPrism looks appealing (especially since I have a spare Coral laying around). I really like how LibrePhotos looks, Immich, ImageStore, HomeGallery, and Damselfly all look good too. Unfortunately lots of these either don&#x27;t have a mobile app or require sideloading. That&#x27;s fine for me, but maybe not for user #2, and definitely not for any additional users someday. So my questions: 
  
Any overall recommendations for this photo software use case?
 
Am I thinking about this wrong, should syncing and photo hosting be separate parts of a bigger software stack?
 
If yes to previous, any guidance on coming up with a list of software I need to host to be a robust backbone for future self-hosting?
 
 A bit of background on what I&#x27;m currently running: 
  
Truenas on decent but low-power
 
Homeassistant recently migrated from a VM to a mini pc
 
Some linux VMs on the Truenas box for things like a minecraft server and testing
 
pfsense to keep things organized and as safe as I can
 
 edit: someday I&#x27;ll learn how to format correctly before I post, but apparently not today

                              <span>I discovered yunohost recently but unfortunately it&#x27;s just buggy up one side and down the other. I love what they&#x27;re doing but there is so much that is poorly documented or straight up doesn&#x27;t work that I think I&#x27;ll have to let it mature a little more before contributing.
 I&#x27;m looking at Cloudron. I don&#x27;t mind the monthly fee to support the project, but the fact that they absolutely mandate Ubuntu is a deal breaker. I moved all my self-hosted stuff to Debian due to Canonical&#x27;s advertising. I saw Sandstorm, but it seems lack multiple apps that are must-haves for me (Matrix, Cryptpad, etc). I love where Freedombox is going but out-of-the-box, no-apps-installed performance was very poor with heavy CPU load, even at idle, on every device I tried. 
 I know AIO solutions aren&#x27;t perfect for everyone. What I like about them is they let me easily and quickly drop in and out of apps that I might be interested in. I&#x27;d be wary of running a production platform using one but for tinkering and getting a feel for an app, they&#x27;re great.
 Are there any others I might have missed?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m evaluating to move from Trello free account to a selfhosted alternative - have not chosen one, yet.
 A thing that is not clear to me to complete the evaluation if there is a solution that can easily import all trello cards and boards (for now I can lose labels and custom fields), from the beginning to now., if it is possible via trello&#x27;s api+token.
 Have you got some experiences about it?
 Thanks!!!

                              <span>Hello.
 I&#x27;ve been working on something I would like to share with you. It&#x27;s called Assetgrid and it&#x27;s a personal finance management tool.
 Github repo: https://github.com/assetgrid/assetgridapp
 Website: https://assetgrid.app
 Screenshots: https://assetgrid.app/screenshots
 What can Assetgrid do at the moment?
 At the moment Assetgrid is a bit basic, but still useful, which is why I&#x27;m sharing it. It has a powerful CSV importer, simple transaction categorization and it can display your spending in categories and your cash flow and balance over time.
 It also has a powerful query engine and allows bulk editing, so you can quickly categorize your transactions based on simple criteria. If you want a quick overview of your personal finances, give it a try.
 In the future I have bigger plans.
 The vision / long term aims for the project
 I created Assetgrid because I felt that most self-hosted personal finance tools were very tuned for a single task. Most commonly budgets. That allows for very easy to use and intuitive software, but I just personally needed something more. I&#x27;d have one tool to keep track of receipts, another for budgets, a third for loans and investments and I&#x27;d be entering the same information into each tool. I think it just makes sense to collect it all in one place.
 In the near future I will add automation, so you can automatically process imported transactions. I will also add a metadata that allows you to attach any kind of information like file attachments, relations and notes to your data. Once I&#x27;m satisfied with the import/processing aspect I will begin working on budgets, bills, currencies and non-cash assets. I have spent a lot of time considering how the various features should play together and I have some ideas for how to integrate the features in an efficient workflow that doesn&#x27;t get in your way and only presents you to the subset of features you use.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m trying to solve this issue quite some time now without much luck. Hope somebody can help me out. 
 I have NPM (Nginx Proxy Manager) in docker on my Synology DS920+. I managed to set up a wildcard domain for internal services to use (it&#x27;s *.int.mydomain.com, I use Cloudflare as my DNS provider and proxy for exposed applications). Moreovwe I have proxy hosts set up in NPM with SSL and stuff for services which run in other docker containers like heimdall for example. So far so good.
 My problem is I cannot set a proxy host in NPM for native DSM applications, namely for DSM itself, for photos, for drive etc. I would like to set them up like dsm.int.mydomain.com, photos.int.mydomain.com, drive.int.mydomain.com. I know I could use the built in Synology settings to achieve this. But…</span>

 Ideally I&#x27;d like to have docker container, that will be configured with a repo link and serves the static pages of this repo. I.e. initially clones and adds a hook to pull on new commits.
 If it optionally allows to execute a build command on every commit, that would be nice.

 After discontinuing the H2+ due to the parts shortage they now have the H3 and H3+ with an Intel N5105 / N6000 CPU. The box has 2.5 Gbit ethernet and can even be used with the NVMe to ethernet net card.
 This makes for a really awesome low power server and should even be a really capable OPNsense box with that net card. The case options also look amazing, small and simple yet flexible. Having only two SATA ports might be a bit limiting for data horders but then again it&#x27;s easy to add more via USB anyway.
 I&#x27;m really liking what I see there. Especially with power prices surging all over the world, I think this might be a really great low power server recommendation?

                              <span>I am a complete beginner that is learning how to make a website for fun through a VPS. However, I&#x27;m just worried a bit about security and was wondering if someone can ease my anxiety a bit. Here are my questions (with some context included):
  
Most of my stuff is written in HTML and CSS, but I&#x27;m not sure if I made a mistake by making each page a .php file instead of .html. The only thing I have written in PHP is a form that sends messages to my Discord server via webhooks, but that&#x27;s it. Can someone possibly take advantage of this?
 The thing is, I did some research today and realized that I should probably avoid PHP/SQL for now in case someone takes advantage of my mistakes. I wanted to make a dynamic website at first, but I realized that I should probably stick with a static website considering how new I am at this.
 I&#x27;ve been connecting to my VPS from my laptop using WinSCP (SFTP). If my server were to get hacked, would it even be remotely possible for them to compromise my laptop? I&#x27;ve been using it to edit my files.
  
P.S. I disabled logins via passwords and use a private key. I added Fail2Ban as well. I&#x27;m sorry if anyone gets annoyed with my questions, considering I am a complete newbie at this. I&#x27;m open to taking safer alternatives in case I&#x27;m making really bad mistakes. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;m looking at how to get files from my seedbox to my LAN. My connection is pretty slow so I need to limit my downloads to certain times a day. 
 Thinking about somehow using my rclone or syncthing setup, but I thought I&#x27;ll check what others are using.
 Wishlist:
  
bandwidth (per month?) &amp; speed limitation, 
 SFTP, 
 scheduling, 
 pause/resume downloads
 detect new files
 deluge / arr suite integration (?)
  
Thanks in advance!
 PS. I know I need a better internet provider, looking into that as well

                              <span>I have a Synology NAS (DS418) that contains all my media files. I am using a Pi400 and some Docker containers to run the software I use to fill the server (*arrs, download client, etc.).
 I would like to use Unmanic to do what it does and transcode the media files as they come in. I have it set up in its own container, and it seems to be running fine. However, it is DEAD slow when transcoding, which is—you know—the thing I need it to do.
 My assumption is that using the Pi400 as a transcoding device is unreasonable. Not enough umph. Is this correct? Is there something I can do to make this work? Installing Unmanic on the NAS itself would be ideal, but I cannot do it because, well, the Synology DS418 has some limitations.
 Is there a better way to go about this? Should I just start looking for a cheap GPU to create a dedicated transcoding box?
 Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even if the answer is, &quot;It&#x27;s impossible,&quot; it would still be more than I&#x27;ve been able to coax out of Google in the last two weeks.

                              <span>I have a fairly underpowered media server, running sonarr, radarr, and prowlarr.
 Right now all three of them are in separate docker images, but they&#x27;re all also mono based, which is pretty heavy. I&#x27;m toying with the idea of making a custom &quot;arr&quot; docker container with all three of them inside.
 This would save space on images, and I&#x27;m hoping it would also give a bit of a memory boost because they&#x27;d all be sharing a single mono runtime, although I&#x27;m not so sure if that&#x27;s the case.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has done something similar, or if it&#x27;s not as good of an idea as I&#x27;m thinking.

 Here&#x27;s an example of what it does and what I&#x27;ll be using it for, just showing users how to use our app. This is just a dumb example to show how you can click and it moves onto the next part of the video, your able to add captions/notes onto it as well. https://app.arcade.software/share/997mYm5lVquPFhpmKAFn

                              <span>I’ve been thinking about getting a NAS for a while now. I have a external hard drives that I put data on, but everything that is critical I have also backed up on google drive (I have unlimited storage through my university) and only am using around 1 TB. My externals and computers really only add up to around 2-3 TB max (if I backed everything up).
 I’ve been thinking of a NAS for ease of storage to consolidate drives and have quick access between computers, but is it even worth it if I have essentially unlimited google drive storage? Also, would a NAS even be faster if I’m using it over Wifi with 500/30 connection? Was thinking of jumping on the Amazon deal on the DS1522+, but with the drives it would be around $800-1000
 Let me hear your thoughts.

 What does this mean and how do I fix it?

                              <span>I currently have a WD PR4100 NAS with four 4 TB drives (16 TB total space) with a Raid 10, giving me 8 TB of usable space. It is now 95% full and I needed to upgrade.
 With the lowest prices I have every seen, I just purchased four 10 TB drives (40 TB total) and a brand new empty WD PR4100. Which after setting up the Raid will give me an additional 20 TB of usable space.
 Both PR4100s will have the latest OS 5 version.
 So now I will have my original PR4100 with a Raid 10 (which is nearly full) and new blank PR4100 to add to it.
 My question is.... is there any way to expand my current Raid 10 or actually probably my Volume Virtualization to expand with my second PR4100?
 I have everything setup perfectly on my current PR4100, including a VERY customized and manually configured Plex server. It would be awesome just to be able to expand the available storage available with what I have vs having two totally separate network storage units that are not linked or connected together.

                              <span>So, back in Aug 2018 I end up having to file for divorce and put half my life into climate-controlled storage ( I have a metric shitload of books and computer equipment. ) Including a whole bunch of 3.5-inch spinner HDs.
 Fast forward to this past weekend, finally emptied out my locker and moved everything into the house. Fired up the old 6-core AMD (it doesn&#x27;t have AES support in the CPU) that I used to use as a daily driver - not expecting much. Fully expected the drives to be a loss.
 Won&#x27;t boot. No signal on monitor... Hmm
 Figured out it was a RAM issue and now down to 8GB (2x4GB sticks.) Boots OK.
 Fire up old antix-16, ZFS is waaay back on 0.6.9-5 and the DE is fluxbox. LOL I was barebones back then, all the RAM went to ZFS and VMs.
 ​
 Fast forward, fast forward. Backed up my root filesystem, apt-get upgrade and Debian jessie is now at the latest package versions.
 ​
 Upgraded zfs from source to 0.8.6 and ran a scrub on both mirror pools. 
 0% damage, nothing to repair. 
 SMART long tests passed on all drives tested so far.
 ​
 Now I normally would not recommend doing this, #1 you will screw yourself out of disk warranty - and normally I would spin things up every 1.5 years or so - but I plain did not have the space. Was able to recover some missing spreadsheet files from my old /home and will be using the disks till they die, it&#x27;s a spare system at this point and will probably be off most of the time except for some nights and weekends.
 ​
 Just wanted to post a ZFS success story. Didn&#x27;t have to make hashes or anything, ZFS handles it all internally. If you have some backup data that will be sitting for a while, put it on ZFS mirrors - it might last 3.5 - 4 years!

                              <span>are External HDD more reliable than Internal ones? where I&#x27;m from they&#x27;re usually more expensive than their internal counterparts, so this might sound stupid but I just had a showerthought, since external HDD are only powered on when you plug them into your PC shouldn&#x27;t they last longer than the internal ones that are running all the time whenever you&#x27;re using your computer? 
 on the other hand External HDD can be more prone to physical damage if they&#x27;re dropped often or they&#x27;re not stored in a safe or a constantly moving environment.

I know how to go about downloading it but not checking size beforehand. Specifically wanting this collection of 5k+ files. https://archive.org/details/dlarc

                              <span>Hello, today I bought WD Purple 4TB (WD42PURZ), a CMR drive with 256MB cache according to specs from WD. But I noticed this drive has trimming option for some reason. Trim on HDD&#x27;s are used on SMR drives as far as I know. I&#x27;ve been writing random files of more than 1TB to the disk but it didn&#x27;t slow down at all, it can&#x27;t be an SMR drive. But when I researched, I didn&#x27;t find anything related to trimming on CMR drives. I will share the datasheet from WD and a screenshot from CrystalDiskInfo:

 Also this drive has 5040RPM compared to 5400RPM of WD40PURZ. Older PURZ models first came out in 2017, these newer ones with higher caches came out earlier this year. So does anyone know what&#x27;s the deal with these newer Purple models and why they have trim option?

                              <span>I said I&#x27;d help my dad with a project, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was getting myself in for.
 Across the years, he&#x27;s digitised his audio collection, from vinyls through to CDs as well as random torrented tracks and stored them all as mp3/wma files on 3 different devices. It amounts to less than 1TB so it&#x27;s manageable, but I have two challenges.
  
Tidy up all the music and get it into one location There are A LOT of duplicates. Some folders literally just have 3 or 4 of the same song in there named slightly different things. Other folders have a nice tidy set of albums complete with meta data. Is anyone aware of a tool that I could feed all these files into for it to scrape one of each song? He&#x27;s really keen to not lose any of this as some of them are rare tracks he&#x27;s collected over the years.
 
Transfer onto a drive that he can access while away from home. It looks like an NAS is the best option here? I see a lot of mention of services like Plex, I&#x27;m based in the UK so not sure all of these recommendations are applicable?

                              <span>I want to upgrade a NAS, looking at buying 6x 8TB He drives, and the vague terms on returns bothered me enough to start emailing vendors for details, and answer wasn&#x27;t pretty.
 My question to them;
 I return any drives that fail a full surface format with a clean smart test, does that meet your terms for returns? ie no grade B or C drives. 
 Their answer
 We will only accept the return if the drive is not functional. 
 That sounds to me like they won&#x27;t accept a grade B or C. ie clearly failing, but may be possible to format. Weird to me is that they are NOT that much cheaper than refurb sellers offering 3 to 5 year warranty.

                              <span>Hi guys, not sure if this is the right sub so my apologies if not! 
 Have a Peg2R6 unit that has always performed fine, and came back from vacaction to the news that it has 4 of 6 drives down after someone swapped the array and must’ve done something screwy swapping back. Now this has actually happened before and the controller tends to just flag the drives as Dead, as a precaution and I’ve always been able to force them to clear that status and just try again with a command line version of their utility, but this time that’s not working. The controller keeps returning an error saying it’s subsystem is locked, and it won’t respond to a SU level unlock command either. Wondering if anyone has had the same thing happen and if they managed to mount the array any other way? I’d even toss the drives in a PC tower with enough bays if there was a prescribed method for accessing a Promise array another way. 
 Just evaluating options before I give the astronomical quote from the recovery company to my management lol! 
 Oh and it was a six drive array in Raid5 and FOUR of the damn disks are affected. Oh yeah and it’s the main store for the last 3 months of shooting at my video company, despite me waving my arms at that four alarm fire for years. (Guys our tape system doesn’t matter when you don’t buy enough tapes and don’t give me time to backup the arrays except for every quarter.)

                              <span>So I installed Portainer on a VM, and used an application template to get Nginx Proxy Manager up and running.
 Both applications are accessible if I manually type the local IP of the VM and the associated port number for each application.
 Portainer is running on 9443, and Nginx Proxy Manager has the GUI on port 81, and theoretically, it redirects via port 80.
 It doesn&#x27;t seem to be working tho.
 I manually edited my /etc/hosts file to add a couple of fake domains (portainer.vm.com and nginx.vm.com) so I could test the program and see if it worked.
 Through Portainer, I added both containers to a new &quot;Applications&quot; network, but no matter what I try, I always end up in Nginx Proxy Manager&#x27;s congratulations screen, instead of my applications. Why?
 Here is the &quot;Applications&quot; network: https://i.imgur.com/HHFNYrb.png
 Here you can see both applications: https://i.imgur.com/QrdFejh.png
 And here is my the proxy host I&#x27;m trying to set up: https://i.imgur.com/BiDHxaE.png
 You can see I put the local IP of the VM, which I can reach just fine. Typing https://192.168.30.66:9443 gets me to Portainer no problem. The domain itself just points to 192.168.30.66. I tried changing the IP in Nginx Proxy Manager to just &quot;portainer&quot;, maybe it&#x27;s set up as a hostname. No dice. I also tried using the internal IP of the docker network. No dice.
 Whatever I do, I always end up on the congratulations screen when accessing portainer.vm.com.
 What should I do?

                              <span>I was curious if a Linux-based software would allow me to automate tasks on my computer (Ubuntu) that are repetitive and happen multiple times daily.
 I am looking at something similar to Zapier for my desktop computer, not an online service.
 Something like: when folder ABC is updated with a file, make a copy of that new file and move it to Folder DEF
 Is this possible?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;ve just released the first alpha of &quot;The Photo Gallery&quot; and I&#x27;d love to get your opinions.
 I mainly built this due to not liking the designs of other solutions out there and needing something simple to share wedding photos with.
 My goals were:
  
Mount a directory with photos in it (So that the wife can manage and delete the photos she doesn&#x27;t want)
 Allow images to be enlarged
 Take up the full screen width
 Static HTML - why should my server be hammered every render - whilst keeping it dynamic so no build is needed when you change/add/remove photos
 Lazy loading - I personally share 800+ photos on this website
  
Let me know what you think!

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I did a search and could not find anything about this. I&#x27;ve even checked the Awesome-Selfhosted list and could not find anything that fit this criteria.
 I am looking for a Selfhosted alternative for quillbot or grammarly, something to review grammar.
 Has anyone ever seen something like that?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 Step 1: Create a Supabase project
 After your instance is deployed, sign in and create a new project by clicking the green “New project” button. Enter the details of your project such as name, database password, region, and others. Make sure your password is secure! Select a region that&#x27;s closer to your geographical location and press &quot;Create new project&quot; to finish the setup.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m Vihar from Appsmith, a low-code open-source tool to build internal tools and portals fast. Appsmith comes with over 45+ pre-built widgets that can be customized with JavaScript.
 Meet the Table, for instance. Even with 25% of our users sending us telemetry data, it has been used more than 820,000 times since we launched it. 🤯
 Built on top of react-table by TANStack, the Table widget on Appsmith comes with over 20+ ready-to-use features that help you build an entire CRUD app in less than thirty minutes.
 Highlights include:
  
Customizable column properties
 Default and custom themes and styles
 Pagination with Table props and Response URL
 Filter and sort options with multiple AND, OR conditions
 Custom views like Spreadsheet and Detail that auto-refresh
 In-line editing
  
We built our Table on top of it to help you build internal apps lightning-fast with ready features to support the most popular use cases—an admin panel, dashboards, monitoring apps, and more.
 Read the full teardown to learn more.
 P.S.: Appsmith can be run on Docker and K8s. The entire code is open-sourced under Apache-2.0 license. For more details, visit our GitHub.

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve a question about a &quot;good practice&quot; to use Rsync command. I&#x27;m implementing the backups for my services (on VPS), they are running on Docker, and most of them has a &quot;direct&quot; volume to the project folder (not use docker volumes per se).
 Considering that these services are used only by me, there are any problem to execute Rsync without stopping the container before? For now, I&#x27;m running the backup script at 3am, so at this hour there is no activity on the services.
 Thanks in advance! Regards!

                              <span>Hi, I run a small software company and I deliver installation and license files to clients. 
 I need some web app that look enterprise and users should be able to log in and download installation files shared to all users in a group and also license files shared privately for that client only. 
 I also need some kind of crazy basic helpdesk interface to allow clients to open support requests that would be private between us and them. 
 I have tested Projectsend and I have also tested Gitlab to deploy installation files but they’re not exactly I wish to have.
 I can develop something but I hate spending weeks to reinvent the wheel.

 And I&#x27;ve just discovered a nice little feature.
 I have 3 machines (2 VPSes and 1 NAS) running various services, all connected by Wireguard . Homarr is being set up on VPS1, but when I enable the torrent module, it can pick the Qbittorrent instance running on the NAS!

                              <span>I would like to make automated regular backups of my online emails, contacts and calendar in case I lose access to them one day (or until I run my own self-hosted services).
 1) I&#x27;m aware of GMvault and Got-Your-Back for gmails. Are there other options that would work for other email services?
 (e.g. Outlook, etc, or perhaps as long as IMAP/POP3 support is all that&#x27;s needed?)
 2) Are there apps that can do the same (make regular automated backups) for my contacts and calendar from Google (or other services)?
 I am aware of the plethora of choices for CalDAV and CardDAV servers. But a quick glance and none of them seems to support regular syncing with Google or other online services.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello guys
 I just released an easy-to-setup file sharing platform. 
 Features:
  
Create a simple share with a link
 No file size limit, only your disk will be your limit
 Optionally secure your share with a visitor limit and a password
 Dark mode
  
But that&#x27;s only the start I&#x27;ll continue to implement features like sharing with email.
 ​
 Have a look at the project, if you want to host your own file sharing platform :) 
 Demo: https://pingvin-share.dev.eliasschneider.com
 Repository/Installation: https://github.com/stonith404/pingvin-share
 Have a nice day :)

                              <span>hey selfhosters, 
 I&#x27;m bored to pay for hosting a wordpress &amp; miss updates so it broke..
 And I&#x27;m wondering if someone remember that old (10 to 15 years) template/script/website (call it what you want) everybody who want to make a portfolio used ?
 Was really minimalist, white BG, menu on the left (with title over ?), like 3 ways to publish your pictures (carousel or verticaly/horizontaly align..)
 If I remember well it wasn&#x27;t using database (sql) but more something like xml or a txt file to stock your preferences, and you had to login through an .htaccess
 So sorry, I&#x27;m really looking for something specific (hope I don&#x27;t break the rules).
 Or maybe you can share something new for me, minimalist, easy setup/backup, it can run on a pi zero (no powah &#x3D; no money spend)
 thanks :)

                              <span>I have proxmox set up on a tiny computer, one of the VMs is a server running portainer and it has a container for Nginx PM. I use that to shorten internal URLs for the containers and or to remove ports. It works great.
 As you may know, with proxmox, it uses prot 8006. I want to change that with NPM to something like https://pve.my.lan instead of https://pve.my.lan:8006. 
 I created a Proxy Host, (see attachment) as I normally do, however, it dosn&#x27;t work. It will go to the newly created URL but give:
 Unable to connect
 An error occurred during a connection to pve.my.lan.
 The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.
 If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer’s network connection.
 If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently looking for the best site/platform for blogging to promote my writing skills and art… once established and I am used to the blogging site I will be acquiring; I then will work on platforms for both my writing- in which I am very talented and creative as well as know my worth for free lancing if that road is the road I go, as well as my art that I’ve already sold half a dozen pieces for no less then $800.00 each.
 I know many people come into these because they have the talent (And ..well maybe they absolutely do) but I am in this because I am a single mother of two. Now normally I despise that label/phrase -“Single-Mothers” for many reasons. My main one is because it sounds like an excuse for anything a parent might be doing or searching instead of “Real work”.

                              <span>So hi there wonderful selfhosters, I have a question about some odd things I am seeing on my LAN...
 I have a HUAWEI modem in front (10.31.67.1), that&#x27;s the internet modem. Next I have pfSense (10.31.67.2) and all my LAN behind it.
 I notice some firewall logs being repetitive A LOT on my pfSense (I am seeing tons and tons of these log entries):

 then I found out my HUAWEI modem had this (notice the 10.31.67.3 host.. what the hell is that?):
 https://preview.redd.it/7pyy56xym2t91.png?width&#x3D;948&amp;format&#x3D;png&amp;auto&#x3D;webp&amp;s&#x3D;98f6ee4615e2d3f1e1078e602dab2469da3071fa
 Should I be worried? is this normal? is my ISP trying to steal my self-taken-nudes photos from my NAS? lol
 EDIT: attacked... I meant attacked on the title ;(

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like some recomendation for a web ui that would allow me to manage multiple remote db.
 If possible one that can run in a docker container.
 The best scenario would be tu just have one server with the software on it and the ability to easily add connexion.
 I would like something that is free.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations!

 I obviously have Hyper-V but no labs to test myself with.
 Any pointers on what I should be creating or maybe a website with free labs I can test myself on?
 Even a video that would show me what I am trying to create and what not?
 This is my first real attempt at IT and a career change for me (customer service). I&#x27;ve played console games and my Grandfather use to build computers for Macintosh (?). Im watching Messer videos and taking practice exams but I&#x27;d really like to create a server and simulate what is is like out there!!!
 Any advise or direction would be great!!!!

 I am getting a nice /56 currently but am struggling to figure out how to incorporate it. Most of my routing is done on my L3 switch for performance reasons (ie 10G inter vlan routing). I can do slac on my router for directly connected vlans but only my DMZ vlans are there. 
 I’d like to use dhcp internally to provide dns servers, as I use an internal subdomain. Ideally I’d like to have a few IPv6 only subnets and no dns with slac is an issue.
 I’d rather not invent some cron/script to discover the v6-pd block and reconfigured my router/switch/dhcp server and all the static v6 addresses I would need on a bunch of vms (ie dns servers, etc)

                              <span>Hello,
 I want to add a cluster to my homelab to start learning Kubernetes. I have the opportunity to pick up some $90 M900 TFF Thinkcentres (i5-6500t, 8GB Ram, 128GB SSD), but I have a few questions before I pull the trigger.
  
Is $90s a fair price for this hardware?
 How many should I buy? Thinking maybe 4?
 Any downsides to using this type of hardware for learning Kubernetes?
 Could the BIOS have password protection? 
 I know I&#x27;m not buying future-proof hardware, but how soon would this hardware become totally obsolete or totally useless? 
  
I&#x27;m kinda new to the homelab scene but I&#x27;m eager to learn, thank you for you time!

                              <span>This is a potential build for doing research on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and data analysis (generally 10 to 60GB datasets in memory with analyses spread across cores, mainly using Python, e.g. pandas, as a frontend to C++/Rust packages).
 I have never built a desktop before so your advice would really help, thank you!
 It will mainly run Linux (Fedora). I have 1 512GB SSD for Windows, 1 512GB SSD for Linux, and 4 TB SSD for data.
  
I went for the newest Ryzen 7950X because the new Ryzen 7 has double the memory bandwidth versus e.g. the Ryzen 5950X (83.2 GB/s versus 47.68) which is quite helpful in the CFD calculations.
 There is no dGPU: I was planning on using the iGPU only (with 1 external 4K monitor, maybe 2). I won&#x27;t need the machine for machine learning or gaming initially …</span>

                              <span>I plan on building out a NAS using ZFS on TrueNAS SCALE. I plan on having quite a lot of RAM for the ARC cache and I&#x27;m not too worried about having the workload be synchronous because if it dies I&#x27;ll just restart the transfer or lose the couple of seconds of writes/reads. Out of curiosity, though, what would be the &quot;way to go&quot; in terms of CPU power?
 I was thinking about building out an x99 platform with an e5-2698v3 since they&#x27;re quite cheap and pair it with some random Samsung ECC DDR4 at 2133mhz. Would that have enough power to saturate a 10G transfer? Should I spend less? More?

                              <span>Hi, I am in the process to, hopefully, solve my lack of backup strategies. I would like to have a NAS with ~8tb of Storage, but in a small formfactor, silent and low power consumption. I could get a HP Elitedesk 800 G2 SFF with a I5-6600, 8GB RAM and 512gb M.2 SSD for ~80€. This case would only fit 2 HDDs, which would be sufficient for now. The power consumption could be a bit high, but most likely still better than any Build I could pull off.
 I am unsure if this is a good route to Go, or if I should just get a Synology of sorts, tho they are pretty expensive and not as easily upgradable. My budget would be around 200€ for a system (excluding HDDs). Maybe someone has build something similar and/or could give me some Input!

                              <span>I wanted to upgrade the homelab, and seeing the cost/availability of Raspberry Pis, I bought some cheap Lenovo M73 Tinys instead. As a fun experiment, I wanted to see how much I could get out of them. Namely, will it have enough horsepower to run vCenter, vSAN, and Tanzu Kubernetes. 
 Result: it technically works. Which is the best kind of works! There is hardly any room for any workload, and likely would not survive if a host failed. Also, each host only has a single 1gb NIC, which means the little switch they&#x27;re plugged into is pretty much saturated (Ubiquiti Flex Mini). But honestly I am surprised at how smoothly things are running, considering all the performance metrics. vCenter is snappy and vmotions of smallish VMs are only a couple minutes. No perceptible issues, although I&#x27;m not running anything particularly heavy.

 3x Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 Tiny with i3-4130T upgraded to 16gb of RAM (their max allowed). PCIe to M.2 adapter and an additional 256gb NVME drive (replaced the wifi card to be used as vSAN cache. Technically all-flash, but configured as Hybrid to cut down on Memory overhead). All in, under $400 total.
 If I were to do it again, I&#x27;d probably shell out for m700 tinys which can get up to 32gb of RAM. I didn&#x27;t go for them in the first place because they would be significantly more expensive and I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend more money for a homelab of my size. (Lets be honest, all I need are a couple Raspberry Pis). I likely will keep vSAN configured and add larger capacity drives to run &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; VMs instead of containers.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been at this for months now trying to get a hardware overhaul done on my main server, as well as setting up a backup server. My original configuration was as follows:
  
EVGA X99 FTW-K
 64GB DDR4-3000 RAM
 Xeon E5-2680v3
 EVGA 450w Bronze PSU
 4x M.2 to NVMe expansion cards
 Buncha drives
  
This server was in an old HAF-XB EVO cause when I built it originally, I had a separate room (and it was the only server I needed/had). After moving around, it didn&#x27;t have a place and instead ended up in the middle of the floor in the living room with cats all over it (resulting in hair and various other gross things in the parts). I needed to rack it, but with racks come a bunch of new issues I am now learning to deal with. After moving the system over to the new case, the motherboard wouldn&#x27;t boot. So I elected to get another one, since it had IPMI built in and I was gonna have to get an IPKVM anyway.
 My new configuration is as follows:
  
ASUS X99-WS/IPMI
 128GB DDR4-3000 RAM (combination of the previous 64GB kit with another 64GB kit, both kits are from the same manufacturer with the same timings)
 Xeon E5-2696v4
 QNAP QM2-4P-384A
 2x IBM M5110 (LSI 9207-8i)
 Bunchmore drives
  
This is getting put into a Supermicro 846E16-R1200B (originally bought a Norco RPC-4224 but ended up returning it in favor of a used R1200B). Now I&#x27;m running into a host of other issues, namely it seems like there&#x27;s more headers on this ASUS X99 board than is available on the Supermicro chassis. Is this board incompatible with this case? I don&#x27;t know what I have to do to get this thing to just fucking work but I&#x27;m really getting to the end of my patience trying to get this to do it&#x27;s thing and any help would be wholly appreciated.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m a bit of a newbie here but I&#x27;ve done a fair bit of research and I work in cybersecurity. 
 ​
 I have a Dell R820 that I&#x27;ve been using for a while. It&#x27;s the model with 4 CPU sockets, all of which are populated. It came with 16GB sticks of RAM in slots A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, and D3. These are all 16GB 2Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks and the server has been working fine. I have 8 sticks of 16GB 4Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks of RAM that came from a different Dell server. I read that I could mix Dual Rank and Quad Rank sticks, but interpreted part of what I read as I couldn&#x27;t mix the different types on the same channel. So I put the Quad Rank sticks on A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2; and put the Dual Rank sticks on starting on the next channel as A5, A6, A7 etc. 
 Is this the correct way to do this? When I booted it said it was configuring the new memory setup, but then it disabled the 7th slot for each channel (A7, B7, C7, D7). Should I just put the Quad Rank sticks on the first 2 slots of each channel and then put the Dual Rank sticks in starting on the 3rd slot of each channel? Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Thought this might be the best place to get some advice on this - I have some fiber run that I used to relocate my AVR into my rack (and still be able to support HDMI 2.1) which gives me several (very) long HDMI runs, 10G networking, and some other stuff.
 I have a few fibers left I&#x27;d like to leverage for some other uses - specifically, a USB connection (without having to run any additional cable) Is anyone aware of a USB over lc fiber extension that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm, leg, and my first born?

                              <span>So prices of electricity is extortionate in the UK currently so im looking at trying to make my servers cheaper to run. I currently have a Diy server running a 3700x, 2x32gb ddr4 3200mhz, MSI B450I GAMING PLUS MAX and a gtx 1060, its running proxmox with 2x 1tb ssd and 2x 1tb 3.5 spinners. Its using arround 105w with everything idle
 My storage server is running truenas and its a hp dl380e g8 with 1x e5-1410 2x 3tb spinners and 2x 2tb spinners 48gb ram (uses about 10gb)
 Any sugestions on builds or maybe even cloud options would be greatly appriciated !

                              <span>So after a lot of tinkering with Docker Swarm, I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s dead and Kubernetes is the future. I am testing a 3 manager node K3s cluster with Traefik as an IngressRoute since I&#x27;m very familiar with Traefik, but the part that stumps me is the main IP for the cluster - which I think is the LoadBalancer part. 
 I have my 3 manager nodes at 10.3.11.41-42-43 but I realize I need one IP in front (like 10.3.11.40) that will do something like round robin DNS (or any other method) to point kubectl and my port forwarding to. I&#x27;m reading some stuff about metallb, but I can&#x27;t find info on whether it does this. 
 I&#x27;ve done the dirty method of having HAproxy in a separate VM but there has to be a better way. Can someone point me in the right direction?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to add more 10Gb capacity for my lab and home servers.
 I don&#x27;t need L3 as I&#x27;m only using LAG&#x27;s w/ LACP, RTSP, and VLAN&#x27;s.
 Someday it might be nice to add 40Gb to my flash based NAS but it&#x27;s not really a necessity.
 Given the cost difference and my lack of L3 requirements is there any reason to go with the CRS317 over the CRS326?

                              <span>Has anyone seen the LinusTechTips video called &quot;2 gaming rigs, 1 Tower&quot;? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LuJYMCbIbPk&amp;t&#x3D;553s Using Unraid as the base OS, I&#x27;ve been able to replicate it as well as run all my home server software in native docker containers on the host. My wife and I both have 2 monitor workstations with Windows 10 and 11, a couple other VMs, and ~20 docker containers. The way this works is that each workstation is a VM with the entire graphics card passed through. So, yeah, I needed two graphics cards.
 I know Unraid gets a bad rap because it can cost up to 120$ (one time), but the ability to have one nice computer run everything I&#x27;d ever need in the home lab is really slick! I&#x27;ve used enterprise level rack servers in the home lab and I didn&#x27;t think was worth the noise and t…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I just picked up a Poweredge T430 with a PERC H730 as well as 4x4 TB SAS drives. I have those installed and have been trying to install Proxmox and have been getting nothing but errors. 
 When trying to install using RAIDZ-2 I get an error that the ZFS root pool could not be created. So I tried installing to a single disk and got an error that it was unable to initialize physical volume /dev/sda3. I tried with each of the 4 drives individually and got the same error but instead referencing sdb3, sdc3, and sdd3. 
 So I tried going the route of installing Debian first and when trying to just install it on a single disk I got the error: The creation of swap space in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,2,0) (sdc) failed. I tried on each disk and got the same error.
 That was all in HBA mode, so I tried to create a RAID using the H730. Each time I created one (RAID 1, RAID 10, RAID 6) it showed the status of the RAID as failed. When I would go into the Debian installer, neither the array nor the disks showed up so I could tell it wasn&#x27;t working. 
 I have flashed the latest firmware to the RAID card and still no luck. I can&#x27;t imagine all 4 disks are dead since I bought them from someone on r/homelabsales who had quite a lot of confirmed trades. Can you think of anything I am doing wrong that would prevent me from installing the OS on the server? Thanks!

 Still needs some finishing touches but it&#x27;s running: Fan Controller 4x hp t520 thinclients with various uses (firewall, home assistant, nextcloud, heimdall, planka, mealie and netbox) 4 x hp t520 thinclient wich can be powered on remotely with the apc for vagrant slaves (running k8s or development stuff) Hp Aruba 2530-24g Synology ds712+ with expansion unit that shares storage by nfs and iscsi. 
 Low noice, low power and lot of flexibility!

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to start building my &quot;LABv1&quot; and I decided to go with 3 office grade pcs from hasswell/skylake era for proxmox HA cluster. So that got me thinking why shouldn&#x27;t I distribute the HDDs between them too.
 It&#x27;ll save me money on buying sata controllers, provide me with better redundancy and better utilization of my servers since the &quot;NAS&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be sitting idle, better expandability since once I run out of space to put hard drives in the machines I got I can just buy a new one without worrying about zpools or raid (which will make my cluster grow too). I plan on each of them having at least 3gbit of bandwidth so that shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.
 Is someone out there running that kind of setup? What software/filesystem would be the best for that kind of application? What are the drawbacks for that approach compared to conventional NAS?

                              <span>Hi everyone, this is my first post in this subreddit as I’ve just completed my first two drives (4tb and 2tb) full of movies Roms and tv series, and I’m about to receive a 14TB x300 drive from Toshiba. I choose this one because I’m planning to use the disk also to access to part of my game/Roms from a steam deck, so using a cabled Ethernet and I wanted a 7200rpm disk. 
 Any suggestion for me ? Could be useful to move the content from the old disks (two WD Red ) into this new one ?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know that this is the right sub for asking this question or not but I can&#x27;t find my answer anywhere else. so I use my old laptop&#x27;s internal HDD as an external with SATA to usb cable. My laptop can shut it down very peacefully but my smart TV turns it off with a horrible sound. I know I&#x27;m damaging it but it doesn&#x27;t matter if you safely eject it( like when you do it on Windows) or just turn off the tv. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?

                              <span>Howdy folks, 
 the wife has a mac laptop with small storage, so she has to transfer her files to an external HDD every now and then to free up space. The external 1Tb HDD has an exFAT filesystem, since I have an spare 1Tb internal drive around I can use an external dock and use it as a second backup. 
 What&#x27;s the best way to backup things, just copy/paste? which filesystem is recommended that works well with MacOS and probably with Windows?

 So a friend of mine i was having lunch today with mentioned he just ordered a new ARC GPU to upgrade his media server to AV1, he was telling me that it would save him nearly half the space on his server if he converted everything to AV1 from h265, but im not sure if he was 100% correct. I recently converted my own media over to h265 for space-saving, but is AV1 really that much better and still similar quality?

 I have a large collection of TV shows. I&#x27;m a C# coder and wrote a method that sets a folder&#x27;s or file&#x27;s Date Created and Date Modified so Windows Explorer can use those columns to sort the TV shows and TV show episodes by IMDB rating or by the year that the TV show started. If you&#x27;re curious, here is what that looks like.
 Over the years I have periodically sent my son hard-drives full of TV shows. He is accustomed to using the sort features. The only problem with that method is the drive getting stale. He is often interested in on-going shows and asked me to figure out a way to make episodes available as soon as I can get them (and run my code).
 I have about 16TB of TV shows. Only a teeny percentage of that is on-going shows (a new episode ev…</span>

I&#x27;m outside the UK and use a VPN (ProtonVPN) to give myself a UK IP address, which seems to do the trick when I plug in the URL into JDownloader.
 I&#x27;ve been able to download some of the shorter programs (~45mins to 1hour) to completion since they don&#x27;t take very long to download (15mins-1hour), but for the longer programs (~3-5 hours), the download starts off really fast (1-2MB/sec), then slows down to about 200-400 kb/s, then eventually stops altogether. I assume the BBC is throttling the download speeds since my internet connection is much faster (70 Mbps download speed as per speedtest). The most I&#x27;ve been able to download is 1i…</span>

                              <span>Im looking for some portable yet quite safe (raid1) solution. Traditional NASes are bulky (even 2,5&#x27; drive ones). Nvme NASes are small but pricey and still quite slow (1 or 2,5gbit). USB raid enclosures (icydock, orico) seems like perfect solution for me. Portable, fast (?) and very affordable. Yet i don&#x27;t know how much their raid systems are trustworthy comparing to qnap/Synology (not to mention zfs, btrfs etc)
 Does anybody have experience with them?

                              <span>Ok so this is my first attempt at getting into raid and I&#x27;ve been looking into it. I want to either go for raid 0 for the speed or raid 5 for the potential fault recovery. My files are mostly movies and TV but I will backup more or less everything on it. I already have some redundant backup in the form of a 10tb and a 4tb.
 If I get the non pro ironwolf 5x 8TB it will cost me $925. Or $23 per TB. It also leaves me no empty bays. 
 But if I get the Exos 16TB drives it will give me the same level of storage if I only get 3. Which will cost me $840 or $17.5 per TB. Which still leaves me 2 bays for expansion. 
 All of these will leave me with 32TB of storage in a raid 5 setup. But everywhere I look it seems to suggest that the ironwolf is the cheaper solution and the exos is even more expensive than the pro ironwolfs. Which would still even cost me $60 more to get the 16TB pro Ironwolfs. 
 So why is Exos listed as the more expensive and objectively better tier when it appears to be cheaper overall. Sure I won&#x27;t get the same speeds as running 5 bays but eventually I could. 
 Unless I am missing something here. 
 Any input would be great. Also. I havent decided on a 5 bay enclosure yet. If anyone has any recommendations that would be great.

                              <span>At some point I would like to transfer my cloud storage data to something local within my home. Right now I have used about 85TB with my cloud storage provider and would like to have at least around 160TB in a RAID setup. The problem is, I really would prefer not to have to deal with potential HDD failures when I might have the option of using far more durable/dependable SSD&#x27;s. I know the cost for 20 8TB SSD&#x27;s is ridiculous, but beyond the cost...is it something that would be relatively easy to do? If not, I could buy 32 10TB HDD&#x27;s for about half the cost. Thank you. Also, this is for media backup (UHD, BD and DVR backups).
 EDIT: Okay, it has been made clear to me 1.) That my fears of HDD failures were overblown and going full SSD would be a substantial overreaction and 2.) The cost is so much greater that I could actually replaced an entire array of HDD&#x27;s multiple times for the cost the SSD array.

                              <span>Hello Data Hoarders ! 
 A few days ago, i got an HP Pavilion DV7-1106EF which i was restoring.
 The original hard drive had the recovery partition untouched, so i imaged it (DD image + AOMEI Backupper).
 After a bit of research, HP doesn&#x27;t provide any driver for this device anymore (what a surprise :o ), and i was thinking about it. 
 Is anybody else imaging oem recovery partition ? Is it &quot;legal&quot; to share them so people having the same device can restore them to factory ?

 I recall seeing some posts when drives go on sale, but I haven&#x27;t seen anything about this. Is it just not as good of a deal as it seems? Should I be worried when a drive is down to less than half of it&#x27;s original price?

                              <span>Hello, I am relatively due to the sub, but I&#x27;m fascinated with the idea of data archiving.
 Over the years I&#x27;ve collected a lot of random very old books, some from the 1800s that I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been able to come across online versions of. Naturally I would love to digitize these and archive them without destroying the physical book, or mailing it to someone else for them to keep.
 Does anyone have any experience with archiving physical books in digital form at home? I assume this can be done with some kind of camera setup, or potentially an app specializing in this thing.
 Does anyone here have any experience with this?

                              <span>Hello folks, this is probably a really basic question, but I have a Hetzner Storage Box (FTP cloud storage) and I would like to download my torrents to directly upload to the cloud. I have a few large torrents I&#x27;d like to download that are too big for my computer, and I plan to move them to the cloud anyway, so sending them directly to the cloud would be the best option for me. Is there a tutorial on how to do this? I&#x27;d like to use as little third party software as possible, and without paying for a seedbox or something.
 I currently use qbittorent on mac but I also have access to a PC and wouldn&#x27;t mind switching torrent clients. Thank you!

                              <span>Hello, sorry for another &quot;help me organize&quot; post but I didn&#x27;t find what I needed in the search.
 I have thousands of books downloaded and they aren&#x27;t all named consistently. I&#x27;d like to rename all of them by &quot;author-title-year&quot; and group duplicate books together. Some duplicates may be different editions/quality scans so I don&#x27;t want to delete them right away, so if it&#x27;s possible to check if they files are exactly the same or not that would also help. also... the files are all stored on an FTP cloud storage right now, if that makes a difference. I have both a Mac and PC available.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I’m to make it easier to try new food and grocery shop better. I’ve tried grocy, kitchen owl, and mealie today. I found Mealie was great at importing the recipes including their urls automatically for and all I had to provide was the url. It does make a shopping list for me super easily, but there’s no organization to it. 
 So instead, I’m creating a pdf, copying that from my phone, and pasting it into this app anylist. Anylist is not selfhosted, but it does automatically organize the shopping list. It Will group dairy products together, vegetables in the produce section, which is great for not going in circle at the store. Kitchen owl and grocy didn’t seem to offer anything as fast and possible. Is there a different application that would make more sense, or a better way to use these applications?

                              <span>Hey all,
 at the moment:
 running a unRAID VM on proxmox for storage (2x18TB). Storage is distributed to VMs through NFS.
 Thinking about:
 Ditching unRAID, running ZFS on proxmox and creating VDisks as needed
 Pro:
 -Easier/flatter setup
 -Backups are easier (proxmox backup server)
 -can ditch the NFS mounting to VMs
 -can ditch passthrough
 Cons:
 -I want raidz1 for redundancy and to be able to expand with more 18TB disks, which is harder/impossible?
 -all disks need to spin up if needed (they are mostly unused, and I want them to spin down for energy reasons [please no discussion about that, my system uses 30W spun down as of now and I don&#x27;t want to double that]
 -i have to resize vhds if I ever want to adjust which VM needs how much space
 -if things go down, all data is lost. On unraid, individual disks stay readable. I don&#x27;t have ECC ram which I get conflicting Infos about 
 What do you think? Anything I can do against the cons? It&#x27;s running fine right now, but am rethinking if I should change it. I don&#x27;t need network shares or the other stuff on unRAID.

 In Safari, when you enable the Developer Menu, and then enable HTTP3 under Experimental Features: it seems to automatically jump to HTTP3 -- I believe, by reading these HTTPS DNS records that specify that you have h3 enabled.
 Other browsers are also using these records, increasingly.

                              <span>Hey there,
 Background:
  
I got an old desktop that used to be a gaming PC with an i7 CPU and 16GB of ram. 
 For some reason, I had the thought the other day that it would be super fun to just boot into a Linux distro that had easy access to VM software like QEMU, or Virtualbox, etc that would make it DEAD simply to just run some VDI&#x27;s, especially ones like this from Archive.org which sound like a blast: 
 https://archive.org/details/windows-server-2016-x-64
 https://archive.org/details/windows_95_vdi
 
  
My Plan:
  
Maybe run some cool stuff with 2GB of RAM each, low headroom, but to run some useful stuff from time to time, maybe a Jellyfin instance when I want to spin it up, a DOSBox based virtual machine to play DOS games, a VM for retro games, a VM for Windows stuff, a VM for old school MacOS or Amiga era stuff, you get the idea.
  
Your Input:
  
With this in mind, I&#x27;m curious, what are the coolest Virtual Machine setups you guys currently have? 
 Would love to see what ideas people have, as I really like exploring operating systems and learning different things, etc, or retro hardware too, etc.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been running LinuxServer.io&#x27;s SWAG as a reverse proxy for ages and it&#x27;s been working perfectly.
 I have Authelia securing WAN requests with 2FA. I read this article: https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/blocking-malicious-connections-with-crowdsec-and-swag
 and was interested in adding Crowdsec into the mix to do IDS / IPS. In the article it mentions that you can have crowdsec analyse and block based on the SWAG logs (fine, I get this), but it also mentions that you can have it operate at application level and access the logs of apps like nginx, wordpress, home assistant etc etc. 
 My question is; if all external traffic is being passed through SWAG as the reverse proxy, what&#x27;s the benefit of having crowdsec monitor the applications as well? Does this bring extra security or is it just a duplication of effort?
 Bonus question: I also have a Unifi UDMP which does IDS / IPS at the gateway, should I just continue to use this instead (the functionality is more basic I think and doesn&#x27;t really do much wrt to reporting), run both, or switch it off?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve seen that the decoders and encoders on the Apple silicon M1 chips are wonderfully efficient, handling high speed h.265 encoding with what appears to be just a couple watts. Phenomenally, at the other end of things, we have the latest cards from AMD and Nvidia that can do fast transcoding but they are all 100W+ behemoths. In fact, a quick survey leads me to believe that all of the &lt;75w GPUs available today are 5+ years old which means they have old encode/decode technology. 
 My assumption is that the market for low power transcoding has gone to Intel quicksync. 
 I&#x27;ve recently been setting up a Dell PowerEdge to handle a number of different functions including, I had hoped, some occasional on-the-fly transcoding. Then I had to slap my forehead when I realized that the Dell server firmware doesn&#x27;t support any igpu functionality - so no Intel QS for this machine. I would have to add a separate video card if I want hardware encoding. But there aren&#x27;t any attractive options that I can find.

 Is that even possible?

 i want to keep my photoprism instance for my own personal photo library, but for the libraries which i want to share with other people i want an alternative to photoprism which has multi-user functionality and an android app from which it can be accessed. 
 Thanks for any suggestions in advance :)

                              <span>OK - I&#x27;m a bit all over the place, but I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can point me to a good guide that will help me link a domain I purchased to my webserver?
 I bought a domain from Google Domains, then discovered CloudFlare is perhaps a bit more secure/healthy, so I&#x27;ve been trying to migrate it over there. At the same time, I&#x27;m trying to link it to the specific device on my network that hosts the webpage I want to display at that domain. 
 What I can currently do
  
Have a simple page locally hosted on OpenWRT (I can go on my network to 192.168.X.X:port and see my webpage come up)
 Have a port correctly forwarded (I can go from the internet to X.X.X.X:port [my public IP] and see my webpage come up)
 Log into Google Domains and see that I own a domain
 Log into CloudFlare Dashboard and see that my website is &quot;active&quot;, that I&#x27;m using the right nameservers etc
  
What I cannot do
  
Link my domain to my X.X.X.X:port
 Get Dynamic DNS properly running on OpenWRT - this is a separate problem, I&#x27;ve followed a guide and it should be working, not sure why it&#x27;s not but for now the DNS type A record on CloudFlare is accurate, because I manually entered it, so one thing at a time
  
Anyway, I can&#x27;t be the first person who bought a domain and is now trying to self-host a simple web page - but I can&#x27;t seem to find a good step-by-step guide online anywhere. Does anyone know of one? Or better yet, does anyone feel like jumping on a voice call with me on discord and walking me through something I might be doing wrong?
 Also - is the right thing to forward a random port? Or should I be using 80/443 somehow and have an internal proxy? Or is Cloudflare enough?
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Just updated my library of media apps you can self-host with one-click. Default deployment from the list is for the cloud right now but you can easily self-host most of them locally with e.g. Caprover
 All the classics are there: basically the whole ARR-stack, Plex, Jellyfin and friends. But also other apps not usually mentioned, like MediaCMS, Funkwhale and so on. Those allow you to self-host Spotify or Youtube-like experiences, not all of them are one-click though. 
 Anything missing? What apps should I add/did I get the categories right?

                              <span>Needless to say that if you expose any services in the HomeLab you should use a reverse proxy to minimize the number of forwarded ports. The use of an authentication portal like Authelia will also greatly improve security. Adding a Cloudflare proxy will mask your real IP and increase security even more. I started with HomeLab approximately a year ago and it took a lot of time to figure out all this. So, for beginners like myself, I just want to share the full working docker-compose configuration of Traefik with Authelia and the use of CloudFlare DNS for getting Let’s Encrypt certificate for the domain. Working well for me already for some time, so I hope will be useful for others.

                              <span>Hey everyone, might be a quick and easy question:
 My PiHole is my DNS server.
 I created a DNS entry like this: pihole.local - 192.168.1.13.
 In Nginx Proxy Manager, I have it setup like this, and this is the path redirect.
 In my docker-compose for the PiHole part, instead of exposing port 80, I exposed 82 on the host:
 pihole: container_name: pihole image: pihole/pihole:latest ports: - &quot;53:53/tcp&quot; - &quot;53:53/udp&quot; - &quot;82:80/tcp&quot; 
 When I navigate to pihole.local, I see the &quot;Congratulations!&quot; page. If I go to pihole.local/admin, I see the PiHole UI, but I&#x27;m not sure why it doesn&#x27;t do it automatically.
 Eventually, I want to go to pihole.local and be moved to 192.168.1.13/admin since that is the admin UI for PiHole.
 Any help would be appreciated :)

 I&#x27;ve tested successfully my Plex Server with the Meta Quest 2 app Bigscreen so I can have a theater experience that can be shared with friends, and added a build of the Home Assistant app for the Quest to get diagnostics and use for automations!
 That got me thinking, are there any cool apps you self host that can be useful in VR? Preferably docker containers, if possible! I&#x27;m trying to build a mini metaverse for my students and I&#x27;m looking for ideas!
 Thank you!

The cameras are on their own isolated network with zero access to anything, I host my own ntp, and recursive dns, that all requests are forced to go through. No one can touch me! Then it dawned me that I frequently access these devices through their web interfaces on my open laptop. Can&#x27;t they, at that point, load whatever data they want from the cameras and use the web interface to send it wherever they want?

                              <span>Hi everybody, I am going to transfer about 400 gigs of .MP4 files of my very old Fraps gameplay videos from a 2TB Seagate external hard drive to a 2TB internal hard drive on my Windows 10, but I want to do this in the safest way possible, and to preserve the lifespan/integrity of both drives, and also the files, I just want to make sure everything goes right.
  
To begin, the videos are all in a single folder, I could just simply copy and paste the whole 300 gb folder to the other hard drive, but I am afraid that this will overload either hard drive, or cause issues because of how big it is, so some of my friends told me to do it slowly, like, I am planning to instead transfer 10 gigabytes per minute or something, instead of everything all at the same time, idk, is this a good idea? or no?
 
From the threads about it in here and elsewhere, people say to not drag the files to the other hard drive, but to ctrl+c ctrl+v it, so I will be doing this, also I do not care how long it will take, as long as everything goes right (I think it will take around an hour or so)
 
I know that the external hard drive gets super hot when doing this, should I put a ventilator beside it? cause if so I have that ready, same for the internal hard drive too?
 
I am planning to delete the files from the external hard drive they are in, because they are just uselessly occupying too much space, but I am planning to wait some few days to see if the files are alright on the other hd.
 
 That is all, pretty simple, but I wanted some advice cause I am not too much tech savvy.

                              <span>A little storage help if anyone can. I&#x27;m thinking of getting a new build and one of my issues right now is storage space. I&#x27;ve got a couple of small SSDs but I have an 8TB HDD that&#x27;s almost full. I do have an equivalent amount in external and I use those to make back ups, but I want to expand to 12-14TB in my new build. What&#x27;s really odd is that most recommended PC builds I&#x27;ve been looking at have HDDs with around 2-4TB. It has me thinking that maybe I&#x27;m approaching this the wrong way. Aren&#x27;t 5-10TB hdd drives cheap? Why so low when today&#x27;s AAA games are 100gb+ and 4K video sizes are enormous? Should I be data hoarding a smarter way?

I’m new to this whole scene so I’m not sure if that’s even possible, is it ? Also what kind of operating system will be on the NAS storage ? I need around 10 TB how much will that cost me !?

                              <span>Ill try to keep this short and easy to grasp what I&#x27;m thinking.
 Currently my media is on various 14,16,18TB disk drives. - I don&#x27;t like how slow it is to wake the drives up and load the content.
 I currently have 12 4TB mx500s. - I was thinking of raid 5 or 6 for parity. 
 HOWEVER - 
 If I take 4 - 4TB MX500s and raid 0 - 16TB - ill gain 4x on read speed on top of the already gain from going from disk to ssd.
 Ill use the spin disks to make backups of each &quot;x4-4TB raid 0&quot; so if I lose a SSD in the raid I can rebuild from the spin disk.
 If I&#x27;m paranoid about it I can make two backups ups of the raid 0s just in case if I need to spin up the disk that has been sitting for a year and it fails ill have a backup to that backup.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had such an odd issue.
 I have a 10TB SATA drive I&#x27;m trying to get working in a new TrueNAS build. I can&#x27;t get it to show up when connected to my HBA or directly to the motherboard with a SATA cable. I&#x27;ve tried getting to show up in lsblk on this new host but it just won&#x27;t seem to.
 The model is WD101EMAZ-11G7DA0, which I don&#x27;t believe needs the 3.3v mod.
 Here is the Crystal Disk Info: https://imgur.com/a/FCSN460
 I&#x27;ve tried multiple SATA power connectors, as well as multiple breakout cables and SATA data cables and nothing seems to help or make a difference
 The really odd thing is that the disk shows up just fine on the R720XD that I&#x27;ve been using until now as my NAS.
 Is anyone able to provide some insight on something I might be overlooking?

                              <span>Right what it says in the title. I really want to like Datacrow, it seems like exactly what I&#x27;m looking for, but I can&#x27;t really find any sort of tutorials/wikis/guides outside of the in-software help menu. Which, while extensive, is difficult for me to read through and doesn&#x27;t seem to answer a lot of questions.
 If any of you know of a resource that might be of use to me, please share. 
 And if anyone can help me out with my two biggest questions right now, that&#x27;d be great: one, is there any kind of dark mode? I&#x27;ve looked through the color/view settings and while I&#x27;ve found some options, the large center fields remain white and it&#x27;s hurting my eyes. Two, how are individual tags separated? Brackets or something? Because ultimately, that&#x27;s what I really want from a catalog system, the ability to search and filter by tags and I can&#x27;t figure out how to separate them so they&#x27;re usable

                              <span>Hello everyone! I am a member of a Minecraft archival group that goes by the name of Omniarchive. Our primary focus is to preserve the game&#x27;s history by archiving missing versions of the game, as well as other content such as screenshot, videos, mods, maps etc. We made a post on this over a year ago but I thought it would be a good idea to renew the appeal.
 We have also relatively recently been featured in numerous articles thanks to our efforts with finding a particularly rare build of the game. Example: https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-archivists-have-found-their-holy-grail/
 You can join our Discord server if interested: https://discord.gg/h45wxnE and our website: Omniarchive.net
 If you have played the game in its earliest days (2009 and early 2010) and saved .jar files deliberately,…</span>

So I came to ask if there are any free and easy ways to archive large quantities of images somewhere private where I can access them from any device. I&#x27;m interested in archiving a ton of art (nothing nsfw FYI) so I can have it all in one place. So is there any site or application I can use to do that for free and conveniently (for example it has to support uploading images en masse so I don&#x27;t have to upload them one by one)?

                              <span>So my Unraid server started spitting out some errors that one of my drives is having problems so I&#x27;ve ordered a new disk to replace the old disk.
 I was wondering if the old disk still has some value. Is there anything me or someone else can still use this disk for? And could I consider selling the old disk or is it just junk at this point?
 It&#x27;s a WD RED 8TB (WD80EFZX)

                              <span>It’s been asked here before, and I was curious so I checked. So this video from 2006 looks like a potato.(240p)
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;eklHFp9HzA8
 But this one looks and sounds so much better. (360p)
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;CC3kkZnt0kk
 Do they downgrade quality? Were those videos better before? Thank you.

                              <span>Huge fan of the sub. I&#x27;m trying to gain a better understanding of those of you who use a cloud service to hoard, whether you have been grandfathered into an unlimited storage deal or not. 
 1) Wouldn&#x27;t it be more practical to use an on-prem storage solution? I feel like the cost of a cloud service would eventually hit the point to where simply buying your own storage would become more economical. 
 2) Do you still feel you are in complete control and own your data? It&#x27;s hard for me to imagine trusting someone else to maintain all of my data for me. 
 3) I am currently visiting outside of the US (my home country) and I use a Synology 1821+ to house about 70TBs of my data. The upload/download times are terrible. How long does it take you to upload or bring your data back down? I understand your internet service will play a large part in this, but it seems like it would take a long time to upload a single 4k REMUX that is &gt;50GB. 
 4) How often are you accessing the data? Is it for archival purposes or are you regularly accessing it? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Unraid obviously does it&#x27;s own thing but for all the other folks out there, especially windows people it can be hard to know what tools work best when checking to see if a new drive is good or bad, so many regrets I see from people who ended up getting a lemon and didn&#x27;t know until later on. So let&#x27;s here it for 2022 before the buying spree starts, what tool do you prefer?

                              <span>Hey guys! I have a Buffalo Terastation 5400 running (2) 3TB and (2) 4TB drives. The unit is running the most up to date firmware. I plan to expand to (4) 8TB drives soon and had a question. I remember reading somewhere that sometimes the units can have a max they can take for HDD space. Is there any restrictions on this unit that would prevent me from continuing expanding it? As it sits it works entirely fine for my use (Plex Storage). The unit has been upgraded from its 2GB RAM to 4GB.
 Any advice would be helpful thanks!

                              <span>Semi-professional video editor here.
 In 2016 I was working on a documentary project that involved a lot of footage. I wanted a secure way to back up all of these assets. After a ton of research I ended up purchasing an mLogic mTape Thunderbolt 2 LTO-6 Ultrium External Tape Drive. This was especially attractive at the time because the Thunderbolt 2 interface promised speed and it worked with my Mac.
 After purchase I filled a total of 14 x 2.5 TB tapes.
 Project finished a few years later. Fortunately I was able to complete all my work without any mishaps.
 A few weeks ago, though, I decided to review my tapes to see if I still needed all of that data.
 4 of the 14 tapes (28%) are unreadable.
 As I said, my work on this project was completed a long time ago and, thankfully, this data is no longer essential.
 However, the experience has left me wondering:
 Is this a typical failure rate for LTO tapes (all high-quality FujiFilm LTO Ultrium 6 Data Cartridges)
  
 I can’t imagine this IS typical - since everything I’ve read about tape backup touts it as the most reliable of all backup systems - but assuming it is, what other possible explanations could account for the failures?
  Is there anything that can be done to salvage the failed tapes?
  
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello there !
 I&#x27;m currently a bit shy about my setup and wont psot any pictures of it now, but i&#x27;m planing to do so.
 While I try to get enought courage to do it I&#x27;m thinking a lot about getting an actual server or get an upgrade on my current pc, as I don&#x27;t have absolutely none experience with server hardware I&#x27;m kind of excited about it but ... there is always a but, here in Brazil every piece of tech is very expensive right now and used hardware is rarely reliable (a lot of fake and damaged stuff).
 I have a good pc right now, a Ryzen5 5600g + 16gb ram + asrock a320m + rtx3060 + ssd and nvme hd.
 One of my thoughts right now is to repurpose an old Athlon 3000g by upgrading my currently mobo and ram, so i can give this athlon a new place to be with this a320 + 16gb ddr4 2666 and get a new b450m + 16gb ddr4 3200. In the near future the plan is to get a dedicated CUDA gpu fot the atlhon pc.
 Would this pc be a good/viable option to run a 24/7 server runing proxmox ?
 I do have a mini pc (n5095 + 16gbram) running proxmox with a few LXC containers and Hassio on a VM, but I really want to get a way to run a face detection software with gpu processing and maybe a plex server.
 The &quot;lab&quot; includes an old rpi4 runing OMV, whitch I would transfer to the Atlhon pc as well.
 Financially speaking this upgrade would cost me less than a server, a used proliant gen8 can be found here for 600 ~ 1000 USD, a used r720 starts at 1500USD and to get the upgraded pc it would cost me something around 350 ~ 450 USD.
 Considering that regular pcs not always get to work well with 24/7 operation and server kind of are made for it, would you recomend? Does it worth the effort to upgrade the pc or its (much) better to wait more (2023.2 probably) to get a real server?
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any tips and sugestions.

                              <span>Hi all
 Ive been labbing for around 7 years now and its grown to the point where I host quite a bit of stuff for friends/family on a semi serious level and have put a decent chunk of money into it, but aside from the bare minimum, ive not done a lot security wise. 
 Just logged into my FTP server and found 18k failed login attempts and that suddenly prompted an oh cock moment. 
 What would be your general tips for security hardening? I dont do anything super stupid (unique passwords for each vm, dont use root for everything, dont have unnecessary ports open, just installed fail2ban) - but I dont take any extra precautions either. 
 Any beginner to intermediate hardening tips?
 Would it be worth paying someone some beer money to do some quick easy pentest stuff?

                              <span>I have recently upgraded some of my equipment for 10G fiber networking, and it turns out that the transceivers I had are not compatible with the cards I bought, despite my initial research telling me they were. Are there any good options for SFP+ cards that don&#x27;t restrict what brands of transceiver you can use? I don&#x27;t want to replace the transceivers, since I got them for free and don&#x27;t really want to spend $50/piece on new ones.

                              <span>Hey all,
 My ASUS RT-AC66U has finally started failing after 7 long years of faithful service, so I got to work replacing it with a TP-Link Archer C7 I had lying around.
 The one feature on the ASUS router I really enjoyed was the built-in DDNS server they had running. You chose any domain you wanted and it was registered to .asuscomm.com. I used this for many years to access my home services and, more recently, to self-host using NPM as my reverse proxy.
 I have Namecheap as my domain registrar and while setting up my Archer C7, I discovered that Namecheap has an article specifically for configuring DD-WRT-powered routers. I was able to follow these instructions successfully, and saw that the WAN IP I have was updated properly in Namecheap&#x27;s portal, so I know that&#x27;s working.
 However, I cannot hit any of my services at their appropriate DNS entries. I&#x27;ve already confirmed the ports are forwarded, and used a port checker. I can use : and it works fine, so I know it&#x27;s an issue with my DNS config, just not sure where.
 Prior to swapping routers, my DNS entries in Namecheap were:
 CNAME record, *,  CNAME record, www, .com
 My new namecheap records include an A+ Dynamic DNS record, but I&#x27;m not sure how to map the entries.
 Appreciate any help with this, thanks!

                              <span>hey all, i&#x27;m trying to find a good selfhosted webmail to group up all of my email accounts (all imap, nothing actually selfhosted)
 so far, the only thing i&#x27;ve tried is cypht w/ docker-compose, but that hardly worked, as I could login, but going to any page would take me back to the login screen and I wasn&#x27;t able to log back in.
 the main alternatives I&#x27;ve found are snappymail and sogo. sogo looks really nice, but it seems heavy, as it has everything, and I only have 2.5g ram with 1.5 taken up. I also can&#x27;t find a good docker image for both snappymail and sogo (i use nginx proxy manager to host everything so using docker for everything makes it easier because i can type in the container name in the dashboard, I also don&#x27;t really know how to get a service on the host into nginx proxy manager)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just set up an M910Q running Proxmox at my mums place.. everything is running smooth.. tailscale subnet router.. remote access to it using Vpro.. but it&#x27;s occured to me that if this box gets screwed up.. i&#x27;ve got no access to her network to fix things..
 I&#x27;m looking for a very low powered device to run proxmox and a couple of LXC&#x27;s (the tailscale subnet router and maybe a backup vpn lxc)...
 It would need to have gigabit ethernet but other than that.. just low power..
 A pi would be perfect but the prices right now are stupid..
 There are plenty of thin clients or tiny pc&#x27;s out there but i don&#x27;t know which to buy..
 I&#x27;m looking at sub £50 if possible.. (if it&#x27;s also got Vpro then that would be awesome!)
 If the £50 didn&#x27;t make it obvious.. i&#x27;m in the UK :)

 This guide walks you through creating a live chat for your website using a self-hosted app called Chatwoot.
 Deploy Chatwoot to your own machine or sign up for the hosted version
 You will first need to set up your Chatwoot instance. There&#x27;s a guide on how to self-host in the official docs. If you feel like testing without deploying a self-hosted version, go to the official website and create an account. 
 Configure the website channel
 Go to &quot;Settings&quot;, then &quot;Inboxes&quot;. After clicking “inbox” then clicking on “Add inbox”, a wizard process will guide you through the steps to set up your website. Click on “Website” and enter your website&#x27;s details, such as:
  
Website Name
 Website Domain
 Widget Color
 Welcome heading And other data
  
Adding an inbox in Chatwoot
 Selecting the website channel
 Configuring your website
 Set up agents and install the website code
 You can select yourself as an agent to get the messages in your inbox. Then, copy the code and paste it into your website following the instructions. You would usually want to add it to the head or the body tag in your HTML, on the top level of your website structure.
 ​
 Copying the live chat snippet to paste into your website code
 The result
 A website live chat widget that customers can use to contact you directly from your website. With the self-hosted version, data is stored directly on your machine.

                              <span>Hello.
 What anti-spam protection are you using and how it&#x27;s working for you ?
 My config for Incoming:
 I am using ASSP + 2 x Postfix as in this picture https://sourceforge.net/p/assp/wiki/ASSP_Advanced_Workflow/attachment/mime.png
 For now it&#x27;s working ok but the internet domain is young so no spam yet.
 Even so, I&#x27;m looking also for additional protection since ASSP has only some of the protections mention here at Automated techniques for email administrators: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques
 So I&#x27;m looking to add Spamassasin to the &quot;chain&quot; at least for the Checksum-based filtering, Hashcash, e.t.c.
 Anybody tried this combination &quot;chain&quot; ?
 Fot Outgoing:
 For now I have none but I&#x27;m looking at PolicyD: https://wiki.policyd.org/
 Do you have other suggestions ?
 P.S. I have activated: DKIM, SPF, DMARK, PTR&#x3D;banner, SSL/TLS, no open relay and the rest that comes default in ASSP also I found my static public IPv4 in one blacklist from over 100 and remove it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying out many, many different photo setups for my photography hobby but I can&#x27;t seem to find one that really suits my exact needs. For photos from a phone with photosync, its an easy choice, but for more involved photo editing, it doesn&#x27;t seem like theres a good solution.
 My biggest need/want is Transferrable metadata
  
I want to be able to move the metadata of files in and out of services so Im not locked into an app. If Photoprism dies tomorrow, I don&#x27;t want to have to redo all my tagging and rating in Piwigo (for example)
  
Id love to be able to Edit photos in DarkTable/another app, and then have the data populate to a web frontend for viewing. 
 Right now, I use Piwigo and Love the granularity of it, but all of the tagging/album creation is done &#x27;in app&#x27;, and means that if piwigo goes away, or a new better solution arrives, I have to redo it all again in the new setup.

                              <span>Has anyone here compared XMPP transports to Matrix birdges? Or even just tried XMPP transports in the last year or two? I&#x27;m mainly thinking Facebook Messenger, Discord, MS Teams (without admin access, I know it&#x27;s a stretch).
 I&#x27;m looking for something that will get me down to a single app and an f-droid only phone. I&#x27;ve been thinking of running a synapse server, but it still seems like it has a few too many rough edges and requires a fair bit of active monitoring. XMPP wonderfully boring and stable, but I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re fully featured enough that they wouldn&#x27;t get in the way.

                              <span>There are some types of information that you want to be highly protected, but at the same time easily accessible and easily backed up. For example ssh keys, backup OTP codes, backups of password manager files etc.
 One way is to add all such sensitive information to a folder on the local disk, then move it to an encrypted archive. This offers good protection and is easy to back up, but it is not easy to add new information. I think the better option is an encrypted folder in a self-hosted Seafile installation. Seems to be well-protected and easy to add new information. What do you think about this? Or do you know other self-hosted applications to save such information?

                              <span>Last week I decided to try notion, I hear a lot about it and I wanted to give it a try.
 After a few days, I liked the idea and started to use it, but soon I started to find things that I didn&#x27;t like so much (no 2FA, no offline...) so I started doing what I always do, looking for its self- hosted alternative.
 Until now I have found Obsidian, Affine and AppFlowy, all of them announce that they are the best alternative for notion. I see them very nice but similar and instead of trying several weeks each of them, I come here to ask your opinions. Which one would you recommend?
 ​
 EDIT: So many options! Now I am even more confused hahaha
 Usually there is two or three best alternatives from proprietary applications...but it seems there is no clear winner with this one.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Alex here with another update on Immich.
 It is October already, the autumn is here, and I hope you are all enjoying the cool weather before the cold gets here (You see, I have lived in America long enough that the first thing that comes before any conversation is about the weather :P)
 This update includes many QoS improvements for the app. The important one is fixing some critical security bugs. Thanks to Huntr.dev and their researchers for helping with testing and reaching out to notify us of the vulnerability.
 We finally removed the Mapbox dependency. It was used for getting the location&#x27;s name (city, state, province, country…etc.) of the photos/videos based on encoded GPS information. Immich now has that functionality baked in, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any part of…</span>

For example, with Ubooquity, needs IP:PORT/ubooquity instead of just IP:PORT like most other containers, at least the ones I&#x27;ve setup a Cloudflare tunnel for, as it doesn&#x27;t allow you to add anything after the port. How can I specify I want my custom hostname to point to the IP:PORT/ubooquity OR how can I turn off the base path in Ubooquity? Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ll spare a lot of the details on how this works, but the still-long-gist is: Ubuntu home server runs VirtualBox Windows VM. Windows VM runs an application that allows the screen to be casted to the Nintendo Switch. The Windows application connects to the local IP of the Nintendo Switch( in this case, 192.168.230.1) Everything works fine locally. The developer of the application is no longer working on the project and I can&#x27;t find any contact information. Nobody else has done this before as far as I know. 
 The Switch is listening for a connection on port 2222-2224(3 ports for various things). Locally, awesome. I want to be able to connect to my home servers VM on 5G data, hotels, etc. So I can&#x27;t port forward my phone data, or a hotels router..I tried running an OpenVPN instance, connecting to it on my switch, so they&#x27;re on the same network.. but in this case, my Switch is connected to my hotspot, and still doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to listen on the ports.. Hope this isn&#x27;t too unrelated, and if it is I&#x27;ll take it down. If anyone has any ideas, let me know!

 https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker
 And installing that seems easy enough the issue is giving the LXC container access to the GPU without giving the container more access than it really requires and setting up the host gpu drivers 
 And if possible I would like a tutorial that does more than nvidia, if running stable diffusion on non-nvidia even is possible at all ?

 Definitely looking for containers/docker based. Nextcloud. A decent amount of good images ready to deploy or atleast be able to build my own in it. 
 Also any advantages/disadvantages in security or other important aspects I should know going this way would be appreciated.
 I am running a ODROID with 2 Terabyte HDs (soon to be SSD). I was running syncloud advertised from nextcloud but I feel very limited with it.
 I appreciate any help or criticism given. Always much love to this community regardless.

                              <span>I have a home server that&#x27;s running a number of different services. Some of them are typical web servers each running in their own Docker container, with nginx delegating web requests to the right server based on subdomain. Others are non-web services running on a specific port. (e.g. OpenVPN, ssh, a game server, etc.)
 What I&#x27;d like to do is prioritize each service so that they all get a certain percentage of my total bandwidth, depending on which services are active and using bandwidth. This however includes differentiating between the different web servers and the non-web services, which makes it tricky.
 Here&#x27;s an example:
  
https​://foo.mydomain.com has a priority of 6
 OpenVPN has a priority of 3
 ssh has a priority of 2
 https​://bar.mydomain.com has a priority of 1
 all uncategorized outgoing traffic (such as normal user web traffic) has a priority of 1
  
...therefore if all four are uploading at once, foo.mydomain.com gets twice the upstream bandwidth as OpenVPN, three times as much bandwidth as ssh, and six times as much as bar.mydomain.com or regular user web traffic.
 Further, if any these services or web servers are being accessed on my LAN, then I don&#x27;t want there to be any bandwidth limiting at all. ~(So I think that excludes being able to use limit_rate directive in my nginx configuration.)~ edit: Nope, I figured out how to use limit_rate depending on source IP.
 I know this kind of thing can be done at the router level with the right QoS feature, except that kind of QoS is based on what port the traffic is coming through. In the case of web servers, it&#x27;s all coming through on port 443 so I can&#x27;t use that to distinguish between them!
 Is there any way to accomplish what I&#x27;m trying to do?

                              <span>Hi! We&#x27;re a small triathlon club, and I&#x27;m looking for a self-hosted shared calendar where all the members can add their own races/competitions, and any other member can add itself as attender, no need to send any invitation. For example:
 If I&#x27;ve a race in 2 months, I add this race on this shared calendar. Other member has the same race, and go to this shared calendar to add it. When see this race is already created (by me), just add itself as attender. If other member are looking for some race in few weeks/months, and see in a race there is already 2 people, maybe just helps to decide to sign in to this race too (and add itself as attender).
 I tried the Nextcloud calendar, but I think only has attenders if already has been invited. One approach can be every attender just add the name into a comments section, but will be more visual to use the &quot;attenders&quot; section.
 Is there any similar calendar to do this? Maybe something like Eventbrite, but integrated in a self-hosted platform like Nextcloud to manage users...
 Thanks a lot!

 I&#x27;d prefer it to have 4 SATA ports and a m.2 slot that way the bays are only storage and the m.2 can run the OS ( will probably use OMV since that&#x27;s what I have the most experience with)

 I have only one issue that I couldn&#x27;t manage to find a solution for even after trying everything. I can access everything locally by using the IP and the port of the service I want as all my devices are on the same network as my server and all my devices work fine I can log in to Nextcloud or HA etc but only one device won&#x27;t connect. Samsung A73 phone I get an unreachable error. I tried with a Motorola android phone, my pc and an Android tablet they all connect except this A73. I tried everything resting the phone, the router and assigning static IP etc but nothing works the phone connect to the internet fine but not locally not matter what. Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>Even as someone who manages servers for a living, I had to google several times to look at the syntax for nginx redirects, redirecting www to non www, redirecting http to https etc etc. Also I had issues with certbot renew getting redirected because of all the said redirect rules I created. So two years ago, I sat down and wrote a guide for myself, to include all possible scenarios when it comes to Nginx + Lert&#x27;s encrypt + Redirects, so here it is. I hope you find it useful

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m using a self built server running Unraid. I&#x27;ve been spending the day playing around with DNS-filtering. Long story short, I ended up using Technetium DNS server because it allowed me to filter domains and also use DoT (DNS over TLS). However, being the paranoid internet user that I am, I feel the need to test whether the DoT is actually working, but I can&#x27;t figure out a good way to do it.
 I&#x27;ve tried this tool and I&#x27;m a bit confused by the results https://1.1.1.1/help
 When I use DoT with Quad9 it tells me that my DNS requests are not encrypted, but if I instead use Cloudflare&#x27;s DoT it says everything is working. Since the tool is made by Cloudflare I am wondering whether the results are accurate. I would prefer it if I could use the Quad9 DoT.
 Are there any good (impartial) tools for testing DoT?
 Edit: I realised that it might be good to also include that I&#x27;ve set the Technetium DNS server as my default DNS in my router, so my entire network should be covered by it.

                              <span>Hello all,
 Hope you have a nice day ahead!
 Anybody here got Seafile in Docker working? 
 I currently have a Seafile instance not Dockerized that works just fine, however I would like to move it to a Docker container.
 I followed the migration doc of Seafile but that does not work.
 By checking the error it tries to connect to MYSQL on localhost which is NOT what I have in the conf file. I think this showed once only.
 I&#x27;m guessing it cannot read the conf folder or maybe it&#x27;s the service URLs in the config that creates the issue?
 I double checked the folder structure and it seems fine. I changed the permissions to root, my user or Seafile which all lead to the same result.
 When doing a curl on the exposed IP and port of Seafile I get a Bad Gateway error from Nginx inside the container.
 Can someone help out? 
 Thanks!

I&#x27;d like to run the OS on the SSD and store data on the SATA HDD which will automatically back up to the USB HDD. Any suggestions on how best to do this would be welcomed.
 I have tried Proxmox but decided to go with Ubuntu as I&#x27;m still learning but could be prepared swap OS.

 imagor is a fast, Docker-ready image processing server written in Go.
 imagor uses one of the most efficient image processing library libvips. It is typically 4-8x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings.
 imagor v1 now implements libvips streaming for parallel processing pipelines, achieving high network throughput.
 imagor is highly extensible, alongside imagorvideo the imagor video thumbnail extension using ffmpeg C bindings.

 Cherry UI Dark Mode
 Cherry is an open source self-hostable bookmark service
 I&#x27;ve spent several months of my off-work time crafting it. It’s built with SvelteKit and uses SQLite for data store.
 It supports full text search, powered by SQLite fts5. You can also import bookmarks from Pocket, Chrome/Firefox/Safari bookmark export and CSV files.
 It has a simple, and probably quite opinionated, web UI. So It’s probably not for everyone, but I do wish there are people enjoy use it as I do.
 Please give it a try and share your feedbacks. Happy self-hosting!

                              <span>I often find myself trying to access one of my servers from my phone via SSH while relaxing to quickly perform a task but the only option out there is this one app in the App Store that charges a subscription. 
 Any self hosted option out there that is mobile friendly?

                              <span>Is there a selfhosted Spiceworks Device Inventory alternative? Every time I see this come up things like Zabbix are suggested. I&#x27;m looking for something more simple. Like Angry IP scanner but is hosted in a server/container that scans the network and lets me know of new devices, keeps an inventory of devices and that&#x27;s about it. I&#x27;d like it to be my system of record for other services like Zabbix.

                              <span>Hi guys.
 Is there any good way to pack an entire website crawl into a single file?
 I&#x27;ve been crawling with wget, but it bothers me a bit that all the images and js and crap &quot;polutes&quot; my filesystem. I&#x27;d like a website to be contained into a single file that could simply be opened in a browser.
 I&#x27;ve found singleFile, which is cool (packs a webpage into only one html file), and has recently added crawling options for entire websites, but in those case the fact that then the browser has to open a 500MB html file slows things down to a crawl understandingly.
 Is there anything that can do that, ie, basically pack an entire crawl into a single file that can easily be opened in a browser (without having to unpack)? Basically a .cbz equivalent but for websites

                              <span>Hey,
 so I&#x27;ve saved a lot of posts and only recently found out that there is a limit of 1000 posts until they starting to disappear.
 So I&#x27;ve requested my data at reddit and it seems like all the posts are there but I&#x27;m not entirely sure as I&#x27;m apparently not a lot over the limit (there are a bit over 1000 saved posts showing up in the data log they sent me)
 So my question: Does anyone else have experiences with this, maybe someone who saved a lot more than 1000 posts, could you recover your saved posts via data request?

                              <span>My friends and I have been working together on a film, which means we&#x27;re constantly dumping raw footage to edit. Unfortunately, despite us paying for storage, this has resulted in OneDrive randomly blocking our account for 24 hours because it seems to think it&#x27;s some sort of piracy ring. 
 This is some really frustrating downtime, and so I&#x27;m on the lookout for a cost effective way for 7 people to have a folder that&#x27;s about 200GB shared between us all.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a 4 disk ZFS raid 10 setup for over 8 years that has been rock solid... 30TB usable storage that&#x27;s mostly movies/tv shows and more recently I have begun to consider switching my implementation towards reducing power consumption (disk spun up time) since anyone accessing a single plex for 1 or 2 media streams cause all of my 4 disks to be active all the time. 
 UNRAID seems like a good compromise that could help by only keeping the disks with the actual file stored in use that need to be while keeping a parity disk (which seems like it would only be able to tolerate a single disk failure at a time; two data disks failing at once in the array seems like it would be catastrophic for unraid). 
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any horror stories or advice to share about this? ZFS has been very very good to me over the years. There is no doubt that I could keep things the same but after awhile it seems like I could be able to use storage tiering (dedicated cache, merged filesystem) with UNRAID plus reducing power consumption by turning down the 24/7 four disk array active most of the time due to some minor I/O activity.
 My workload is primarily Plex media server, NFS/SMB. Going to UNRAID for everything could work; but I could also do a unraid hybrid setup with 2 disks ZFS mirror for my documents and photos while leaving the movies+tv files in other disks (this would increase my hdd count from 4 to 5 though due to parity needs)... a third option (probably very time consuming) is openmediavault + https://github.com/45Drives/autotier + ZFS (on each disk, simply to get the ability to &#x27;zfs send/receive&#x27; to backup to another zfs server nightly)

 As of right now I have 2x 1tb portable drives (HDD), I keep one of them always with me and once in a month I manually copy/sync the files to the second one.
 I plan on having one plugged into a RPI 24/7 and setup a samba share. Then make a script so that I can plug in the second drive and it will automatically copy everything to it. It sends an email notification when done (so I know when I can disconnect the drive). The drive will be stored offline at my friend&#x27;s house, so I have to go there and pick it up and bring it back everytime (which is fine for me, I come there regularly).
 To copy everything I&#x27;m probably going to use rsync with the -b flag (&#x3D;incremental backups). One folder containing all the up-to date files. If a file has changed it will move the old file to a folder with the current date as name and update the file in the &quot;up-to date folder&quot; with the new contents. Same for deleting (moving to the current date folder).
 So before running the script:  /backup/files/test content: test1 
 Then change test1 to test2
 After running the script: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; /backup/2022-10-08/test content: test1
 /backup/files/test content: test2 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 Do you have any tips/recommendations?
 Also, should I include cloud storage in my backup plan? Or maybe get a VPS with a lot of storage? I&#x27;ve been avoiding cloud storage since encryption is a must for me.

 Would a reg SSD plugged into the router be faster than the NAS ?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been processing ArchiveTeam&#x27;s YouTube discussions dataset into something more workable than the unwieldy raw JSON responses saved from YouTube, and I would like to share it to anyone who&#x27;s interested in the data. This all started when a reddit user asked if their channel&#x27;s discussion tab was saved, and I challenged myself into processing this dataset for fun. Here&#x27;s some code that I wrote for this, if anyone is curious.
 Hopefully someone can find a good use for this dataset!
 The dataset is in newline-delimited JSON, divided by comment year (2006-2021), and compressed with ZSTD. Each line represents a single comment.
 Some fun stats:
  
23.1 GB compressed (97.6 GB uncompressed)
 2.1 TB of compressed WARCs processed (~16 TB uncompressed)
 245.3 million comments
 32.3 million…</span>

                              <span>Currently running 5x3.5 drives and nearly out of space. Looking to add an additional five drives. Need a case that can accomodate all 10 drives (or possibly a five drive enclosure). 
 I was looking at the Phanteks Eclipse P600 but I&#x27;m concerned about heat even with a number of fans in the case. Any other thoughts / ideas would be great. No server rack available so rackmount isn&#x27;t necessarily an option (although Im not against setting a case on something)

                              <span>So, here is what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Right now, I have my Data, Movie and TV drive all in my main PC. 3 18TB drives. 
 What I&#x27;d like to do, is move them to a seperate server that has room for three separate backup drives in it. and I&#x27;d like to be able to access it just like a regular drive on my main PC. This way, I won&#x27;t have to copy backup data every month onto my synology device. one less step.
 any ideas? I&#x27;d like it to be windows 11 based so, if I need too, I can just pop it back into my main pc without having to worry about special formats.

Some time ago i was doing backups with Acronis but maybe there is something else good that have option of data compression and some nice GUI (probably I will be doing backups from Windows server virtual machine/ it is only my own files, music, family videos etc)

                              <span>DISCLAIMER: I am not Cisco savvy. I am just getting a homelab set up so that I can start to study for the CCNA.
 I am trying to SSH in to a Cisco 3850 switch so that I can do configuration changes without going through the console port. I have it working where I can access it on the same vlan as the device I am on, but I want to work on setting it up over a management vlan using the MGMT port on the back of the switch. I have tried a lot of the guides I have found on Google but I am not having any luck on being able to get SSH working through the management port.
 My current setup is this:
 OPNsense router/firewall
 3850 switch
 3560CX switch
 My desktop PC on VLAN 10 (192.168.10.200)
 My laptop on VLAN 10 at home (192.168.10.201) and VLAN 69 while on VPN (10.10.69.4)
 Here is the relevant config I have on the 3850 so far: https://pastebin.com/6zspQaXW
 For OPNsense, I have the 3850 management port in igb0 of the router and Gi1/0/1 trunked in to port igb1 of the router. Right now, the management VLAN 42 is set to pass all traffic as a firewall rule but do plan on restricting it to only SSH and TFTP traffic in the future.
 Is there something I am missing or does someone have anything to add to get this to work?

                              <span>Just a thought I had. I can&#x27;t decide where I want my cluster to go next.
 I currently have a 4 node k3s cluster on Raspberry Pi 4s. It used to be 3 masters but a recent update screwed up etcd latency so I&#x27;ve had to go down to a dedicated single master.
 I used to run rook ceph for storage. I really liked how it &quot;just worked™&quot; and I could mess with the cluster all day and not worry about data loss. Adding disks was so simple, just plug in a blank disk and it sucks it up. It doesn&#x27;t natively support arm though so it was hacky and hard to update.
 I moved to Longhorn, but longhorn has a lot of issues. I have to constantly babysit it.
 I want to move to an x86 cluster, ideally with 3 masters and room to expand workers. If each node had a boot dive and space for a secondary drive for rook ceph to use, that would be awesome. There are some good HP, Dell and Lenovo options but I don&#x27;t know which would be best.
 Everyone&#x27;s workload is different. What would you do?

                              <span>Took some time to get this done. The display is from a GPU passed through to Ubuntu Dekstop VM, and have checkmk server in another VM. Also configured checkmk session timeout to never (unset) and condigured Ubuntu lock time to forever, so I have this monitor always showing the up to date lab status!!

                              <span>I am currently wanting to set up a PXE Boot environment so I can build Windows laptops/tablets/workstations using Windows 10/11, servers using Windows Server 2022 and VM&#x27;s running other OS&#x27;s such as Linux. I have an older laptop that I can use as a PXE server to store the ISO files for building the OS&#x27;s and have a QNAP NAS which I understand can be used as a PXE boot server. What is the most flexible (for example be able to easily update the OS&#x27;s available when new Windows or Linux versions are available) and easiest to manage for a relative novice to do this?

                              <span>Speaking of homelabs... Today was all about removing a Dell M1000e from the rack, in preparation for the next iteration of the head-end. From the top down, there&#x27;s a small NAS that just backs up one client&#x27;s data from a couple of their servers, live and revisioned. Aruba 48 port POE switches. Ubiquiti router. Alibi security DVR. UPS for the units above.
 Big hole? That was home to the M1000e - currently awaiting arrival of R930&#x27;s to fill the space - wanted more processing power, more electrical efficiency. 1000 had 12 blades, dual-proc, 4 cores ea, 96 GB RAM, sucked power... R930&#x27;s are E7-8891v4, 512 GB RAM, open drive bays, 10 Gb fiber cards. So, 48 cores &amp; 1150 GB RAM, moving to 200 cores, 2500 GB RAM, and much faster at less power. No brainer.

 I have been trying to set up an ARK server countless of times, and I have never been able to get it up and running. I have been following a dozen of guides, I have tried different hardware setups, docker, VirtualBox, Proxmox, etc, but it just outright refuse to work. 
 I have been following this guide https://youtu.be/_v6yFtNg6yA (except making it a service, I just wanted it up and running first before I did that)
 I start the server with:
 ./ShooterGameServer TheIsland?listen?SessionName&#x3D;(Session Name)?ServerPassword&#x3D;(Password)?ServerAdminPassword&#x3D;(Admin Password) -server -log
 It starts the server, but it gets stuck on this:

                              <span>Around 3 years ago, I bought two HP ProLiant ML350 Gen6 tower servers off local Craigslist for $150. I combined all the RAM and 750W power supplies into one machine, put 6x 3.5&quot; SATA disks in it, and sold off the other. It&#x27;s been running without issues until around two weeks ago, when it started abruptly powering off.
 I found that one of the heatsink retainers had broken, so the heatsink tilted up off the CPU. Figured this was a pretty clear case of thermal shutdown, so I removed that proc entirely, figuring I could run on the remaining one until I figured out what to do longer-term -- swap the motherbord, replace it, or something else.
 The problem lessened in frequency, but didn&#x27;t stop. It went from staying up for ~30 minutes to ~3 hours.
 Maybe the motherboard got damaged? I bought a r…</span>

                              <span>Hi - just learned the hard way that I should have multiple backups of my photos (WD passport failed after 2 years). I&#x27;m not too concerned about speed, just easy of accessing the files. 
 ​
 Any advice/recommendations on a good drive to backup to? Any real advantages to desktop or portable? Should I get 2 drives, or 1 drive and cloud storage? I&#x27;ve been eyeing the WD Elements 4TB or desktop.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been hoarding for probably close to 2 years now, and even though I&#x27;ve learned a lot in that time I&#x27;m still definitely new to this. I started out with a 1TB external drive that I thought would last me forever (oh how naive I was), then a 4TB one, and then I finally got serious with a 4-bay NAS loaded up with 6TB drives in RAID 5. However, I&#x27;ve now gotten to the point where it&#x27;s just a matter of time before even that is not enough.
 Since this is the first time I&#x27;m properly in the situation of having to upgrade four separate drives, I want to make sure I don&#x27;t screw myself over. What sort of prices do you all consider good, particularly for 8 or 12TB drives?

                              <span>My current setup is a Synology DS1520+ with 4x WD Red Plus 8tb WD80EFBX drives. I was filling up on space, and instead of deleting stuff I didn&#x27;t need, I got a 5th drive. It was a WD80EFAX 8tb, but from my reading online, it seemed to be the exact same drive as the WD80EFBX, just reporting now as 7200rpm instead of &quot;5400rpm class&quot;, plus it was a steal at $110 brand new.
 Well the drive is reporting much slower write speeds than my other 4 drives in my Synology. The reported benchmark speeds of my drives are below. Is this something I should be concerned about when I add it as a SHR drive? I can also return the drive for a full refund, but I would need to find another good deal on a WD Red Plus still... Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I will be selling my main computer in favour of building a new one next week. There will be a period of time when I will be stuck with my laptop but still need to access my data on my SSD and HDD. 
 I&#x27;ve thought of getting a SATA-&gt;USB dock, but I&#x27;ve read some reviews and they mention GPT corruption. 
 My current idea is to shift around the data between the HDD and SSD so that I can get everything I will need for work on the SSD and buy a regular enclosure for it for the time being (and use it as an external drive). While the HDD sits tight until I get a PC.
 Having both drives available would be ideal though.
 What would you guys suggest? The time frame where I will be without a desktop will probably be around 2 to 3 months. What&#x27;s the cost-effective solution here?

                              <span>I have only been able to find this book (My Belief by Hermann Hesse) in this scan which is coming from the internet archive. I think it is an incredibly valuable book which I can buy a physical copy of but I think a digital copy would be incredibly valuable. It is out of print and very hard to find! 
 https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5&#x3D;46C0F8FB4D55280A4CFBAE2669AADF8E
 I was wondering if anyone could help point me in the right direction for getting it accurately converted to text. Ideally raw text so I can convert it into a high quality epub.
 I&#x27;ve tried Google Drive to Docs, did not work well at all.
 I&#x27;ve tried tesseract and it was very inaccurate. 
 I&#x27;ve tried Adobe Acrobat pro version and it didn&#x27;t work much better than tesseract.
 The best result I&#x27;ve gotten was with Abbyy but I was only able to convert like 50 pages and it seems silly to pay $80 for a month of the service to convert a single book...
 Was just wondering if anyone is willing to help me out on this. Maybe there is some preprocessing I am missing? Very new to this.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am shipping my NAS around the world with the rest of my equipment and I want to make sure all the equipment arrives safely. I welcome any suggested changes to this plan.
  
Unraid Server
 Case: Fractal Design Define 7
 Drives: 14 hard drives, 2 SSDs
  
The interior of the case will be filled with those expanded foam packets to support the CPU cooler and other bracketry.
 The Unraid USB drive will be backed up and stored in Google Cloud. The USB drive will be with me in my bag.
 The bottom 4 hard drives are backup drives for the main array in a BTRFS file system which will be removed and carried with me on the plane.
 The questionable part: The remaining 10 drives will be left in the case which will be in the case&#x27;s original packaging.(Molded foam blocks and all that.) Which will be palletized with the rest of the equipment and shipped by sea for one to two months. So it should be have less direct handling since it will be moved around as part of its pallet.
 I do have a second option of shipping this one computer case box by air as long as it is no more than 35kg. However, it may experience more direct handling by the shipping company.(Kuroneko Yamato)

                              <span>Forgive me if this is a stupid question - I got my start a few years ago on r/homelab but have continued expanding with more drives (currently 8TB WD Red, 8TB WD White, and an 18TB Seagate Exos). 
 Also installed a Dell H310 6Gbps SAS HBA w/ LSI 9211-8i P20 IT (from the Art of Server) since I’d essentially tapped all the SATA ports on my motherboard. 
 I have everything in a Fractal Node 804, since it has so many drive bays. Eventually, I’d like to move to a rack mounted server (as I continue to add), but the Dell/HP servers I see all have caps at like 8TB/drive?
 Is there a different option - or an empty rack chassis that I can install my own CPU/RAM, etc., into? Then I could continue to run OMV and just keep adding drives as necessary?
 New to this (still) and just thinking down the line.

                              <span>Hi,
 I noticed Toshiba had way more marketshare of HDD than it used to have.
 Do you guys like toshiba drives? I know the market is basically all enterprise so I&#x27;m guessing cloud services like AWS, google, etc are choosing toshiba.
 I just don&#x27;t know why exactly.

I want to pop the dvd into the drive then go into veracrypt then select the DVD drive then mount and enter password to open the encrypted disc - same as a hard drive but as a disc. Is it possible?
 For reference I want to do exactly this but with veracrypt (not DiskCryptor): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;Df12h6uWzNU

                              <span>Hey there hoarders,
 first of all, I&#x27;d like to drop a big THANK YOU. I read the wiki and some posts and it occurred to me that I was, in fact, not backing up everything I got. In the background I&#x27;m now in a bit of a frenzy, ripping CDs, DVDs and games (including keys) I only got on optical media. I mean, what if I dropped a dishwasher on that box when my fiance and I move out?
 Speaking of which, right now I&#x27;m limited to an old (but entirely fine) external HDD and an S3 Glacier archive I push some things to. My fiance and I want to step up our game. Right now we share our flat with two friends and have little space and no LAN ports or bandwidth to spare. Seriously. Our network topology could only be worse if we managed to jam a loop in there.
 So, we made a plan. And I&#x27;d very much appreciate if you could look it over real quick and give some feedback:
  
Buy a couple identical NAS drives and chuck them in external USB cases for now to save space. Subscribe to Backblaze for a cloud backup solution that I won&#x27;t have to sell my first-born for once the wild hoarding ride goes into overdrive.
 Hoard data separate from one another for now to leave our LAN in its current miserable state.
 Once we move, buy another two NAS drives identical to the ones already present and put them in an actualy NAS system in RAID 1.
 Copy our data to the NAS, wipe the external drives and put them in the NAS.
  
Additionally, pray to bit almighty that our temporary solution doesn&#x27;t implode. Thank you in advance!
 P.S.: While writing the above, I discovered that my Unreal Tournament 3 disc ate it. Serves me right.

The latter is more space efficient but requires restoring the previous version through all previous incremental backups and then doing a file diff.

                              <span>Hi Folks, 
 I am hoping that someone here can help or point me in the right direction (I know it may not be an exact fit for this sub). I am looking at digitizing my old negatives and slides and need some advice, as although I have been doing a lot of reading up on the subject, I am getting to the point where I am feeling that I am in over my head. This may be a long post.
 First off, I have a range of undeveloped film (35mm, APS, 110, a few old disposables and even a couple of film disks), as well as negatives and slides (Kodachrome).
 MY questions: The general consensus seems to be that the Plustek 8100 and Epson v600 Photo are the minimum requirement for current gen to achieve decent results, my question here is whether this is still accurate as a lot of the information seems to be from many years ago?
 I have looked through a lot of the standalone and flatbed options, and most seem to be 35mm only, however this seems to only be a limitation of the included mounts, with aftermarket mounts available for the likes of the Plustek standalone and Epson flatbeds. I guess I really just wanted to confirm that this is the case, and I am not missing something?
 It also seems that if this is the case, it should be relatively easy to rig something up for film where it would not warrant the cost of buying an adapter, even if only able to scan one image at a time. I cannot seem to find much information on people actually doing this though, so it may not be viable in practice?
 Well, I guess not as many questions as I thought... I suppose I really just want to find some confirmation from those who know about these things that picking up one of the above scanners is what I need. After I have the scans, I am much more confident with digital manipulation in PS/GIMP than I am with getting them digitized in the first place, and I know whatever way I go at this, it is a long-term project.
 Appreciate any input or suggestions!
 ​
 Cheers,
 ​

                              <span>I need help managing over 50,000 photographs. How can I easily go through them?
 My setup: I have a 10Tb external drive I use as a backup. The files are all in the root folder, sorted by Date Taken. (Maybe the photos should not be in the root so that my drive can open before it starts loading them?) The computer I have is over 10 years old with an AMD APU, and it seems to struggle with loading them all. I was given an older SSD which has increased the speed of Windows significantly. I am not at the PC now, but likely have 16Gb of DDR3.
 Is the bottleneck coming from my processor, or possibly the RAM? My mission is to compile all my photos of my cat, and to also get the photos of all the other animals we have had around our home. Viewing large thumbnails would be preferred but due to the quantity of photos it is a very laborious process. I also don&#x27;t want to stress the external drive too much. (There&#x27;s not AI that can identify animal photos is there?)
 ​
 Additionally, I am wondering if there is a way to &#x27;label&#x27; each photo, i.e. this photo contains photos of my garden and contains a searchable tag of &#x27;garden&#x27; or my cat &#x27;lily&#x27;, or &#x27;wedding&#x27;, &#x27;raccoons&#x27;, &#x27;basement&#x27;, etc.
 If anyone has any ideas I would be interested in hearing them. Thanks.

                              <span>My current NAS has two pools of two drives, and assuming I don&#x27;t change the file structure, it&#x27;s easy to use robocopy and let it skip existing files during backup as both pool and backup drive are the same size.
 When I replace this NAS I&#x27;m thinking of using a single pool of drives instead, and let the NAS handle large directories for me.
 What I wonder in this case is, how do you do backups for offline storage?
 The pool size is most likely going to be larger than the backup drives, so as I see it, NAS files might end up on different backup drives, so you&#x27;d not be able to skip a lot of files.
 Is there a backup solution that accounts for this, other than cloud storage?

                              <span>The longevity of recordable compact discs (CD-Rs), recordable digital versatile discs (DVD±Rs) and recordable Blu-rays (BD-Rs) is uncertain, leading to a widespread lack of trust by libraries and archives. Research studies, anecdotal information and manufacturers’ literature suggest that the lifetime of recordable optical discs can range from a couple of years to more than 200 years. This Note explores several of the factors that affect whether a disc will fail within a short period or will continue to perform well for many years.

The flapless one has a bit narrower a gap than the flap one though. However the flaps were often causing the drive to get stuck so I just removed them. Isn&#x27;t anything that&#x27;s holding a drive in just by the sata connector bad for it? Also do hard drives benefit at all from uasp?

Any help would be much appreciated, I&#x27;ve scoured search engines and similar sites but no luck on finding them even uploaded anywhere else so far.

                              <span>I currently have about 6TB stored but have 12TB total I can store. My setup is 5 3TB drives in a hardware RAID box connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB model.
 I&#x27;d like to be able to have the ability to backup up at least the full 12TB storage. Right now I pay for a Google Workspace account at $18 USD. Due to recent developments at Google cough Stadia I can&#x27;t really rely on Google for long term backups. Can someone please suggest some alternatives? Are there any services that are close to $18 that would let me backup 12TB or even maybe unlimited?

                              <span>According to this page on the Seagate website, connecting SATA drives to SAS controllers is possible, but not the other way around. That&#x27;s fine. That&#x27;s what I want to do.
 I have a mirrored RAIDZ of 18TB SATA drives in my Debian VM, currently using a cheap PCIe SATA controller passed through to the VM in Proxmox. However, this is causing the VM to take literally a full minute and a half to boot, and I don&#x27;t like that. I have been informed that this is likely due to the VM trying to boot from the SATA controller before it gives up and actually boots from the boot drive, which is strange because the boot drive is given priority in the VM settings.
 Whatever the cause, I was told that a decent LSI HBA like the 9211-8i with a firmware flash into IT mode would solve this problem. Indeed, I was informed that the 9211-8i is the go to card for homelabbers to connect their RAIDs to. Old faithful, if you will. So I bought a 9211-8i that is already flashed to IT mode.
 It is a SAS card, and I cannot seem to physically connect the SATA drives to the card. Is there some adapter I need? Is this actually not possible and the link I posted is bullshit? I have done a bunch of googling and I keep finding people asking about connecting SAS drives to SATA controllers and the odd other article about how SATA drives and SAS controllers are compatible, but nothing about how to actually do it.
 Can someone please shed some light on this for me?
 EDIT: Wrong card.

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all, I just got a Dell R320 and have some questions regarding it. This is my first time using a server, I plan to install and learn proxmox on it. 
  
I have a GbE network card attached (pic 1), do i plug in Ethernet into it or use the ports on the motherboard?
 
I have something attached which has two sd card in it, what is it and what is it used for? (pic 2)
 
Is one 32gb ram stick enough for plex transcodings and other light weight services? (pic 3)
 
The rail holder on the server is damaged, will it hold properly? (pic 4)
 
The first hdd caddy is not coming out, it used to pull out but now it doesn&#x27;t, its stuck. (pic 5)
 
Do I need to connect iDRAC separately since it has its own ethernet port?
 
 Thank you for your time and answers.

                              <span>I’m looking for a 4g modem for failover internet for my homelab. I’ve seen some modem-router combo units that have rj11 ports to connect a phone line, but I haven’t had any luck finding dedicated modems with this feature. In theory I could put the router in bridge mode maybe? I’ll be running it into a freepbx server, so if there’s an option that does voip instead that works too.

 I have a networked drive (Server: Windows 10 Pro, Client: MacOS Monterey) that is extremely slow (15-20 MB/s R / W) via SMB 3.
 It is running SMB_3.1.1 as verified when I run smbutil statshares on the Mac.
 I have tried multiple fixes unsuccessfully (disabling SMB Signing, among other random recommendations).

 I’m thinking of shooting a bullet in the dark and setting up TrueNAS via Hyper-V to see if it solves it, but that would require extra time and effort so I am looking for guidance before I go ahead with it.
 Many thanks.

                              <span>Hi, I decided to try my luck with Proxmox server and I have a problem because I cannot find exchange-bmc-os-info package as it is on Fedora or Tumbleweed. I already installed ipmitool package but with no luck :/How do you guys manage iDRAC6 info like Host name, OS Name etc. on Debian or Proxmox? 
 EDIT:
 Found it!
 Set OS information in iDRAC via IPMI there is link to .patch file that contains the script. Sadly it is added only for Red Hat based OSes

 I have a running macOS VM and I want mount the old macOS SSD inside the VM to access the data from my old OS - is this possible? If so can someone please give me some guidance? As I&#x27;m sure you all know, virtualization docs about macOS are very sparse. Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 i am running a HP ProLiant ML350 G6 with the following specs:
  
1x Intel Xeon X5680, 6 Cores
 4x Micron 4GB (&#x3D; 16GB total) ECC RAM, 1333Mhz
 3x Seagate Ironwolf 4TB SATA, 256MB Cache
 8x HP 15k 146GB SAS, Hot-Swap 2,5&#x27;&#x27;
 1x SanDisk SSD Plus 240GB (boot drive)
 1x Dell Perc H310, Dual SAS as RAID/HBA
 1x HP SmartArray P410i (integrated)
  
My plan is to use this build as replacement for my former NAS and do some virtualization stuff. So I will try and go for TrueNAS Scale as my OS of choice. But I have a problem setting up my Dell Perc H310.
 My plan is to set up two separate ZFS pools (one with the 4TB drives and one with the 146Gb drives). To achieve this I connected the 4TB drives directly to the Onboard SATA controller of the server. The integrated SAS caddy is wired to the onboard RAID controller (HP SmartArray P410i) which cannot be used in HBA mode to pass the drives to the system in order to use any form of software RAID. So gain access to the drives directly I needed an real HBA to replace this function.
 I ordered an Dell Perc H310, as it is the most common one around here. The setup should be pretty easy compared to other models. But it needs to be flashed into IT-mode manually as mentioned in this guide. As I am struggling with setting up the proper boot drive, because an security feature of my server prevents me from booting of USB drives, I came across a different problem: My server won&#x27;t boot anything while the HBA is plugged in (any port). The guide told me to wrap some pins with electrical tape to get around this problem, but it won&#x27;t. The startup screen comes up as normal, but it won&#x27;t boot my disc or any bootable drive. Across multiple forums people stated that wrapping is key - but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. As soon as I remove the card from my system everything works fine. 
 Does anyone experienced something similar or is there an tweak in the BIOS or something? I appreciate all answers!

 I don&#x27;t use iLO Amplifier but like someone wrote there:
 ​
  
And to throw more salt on the wound the first two nodes that I installed this SPP on are now bricked, not even able to get into bios 
 IML error is: X64 Exception Type 0x0 (Divide By Zero Exception) occurred during the previous boot. Image name: Unknown 
 Platform is DL385 Gen10 Plus V2, I&#x27;ve opened a support case for that issue.

 Just to let you know.

 Over time I do plan to upgrade the memory and storage but this will be more than enough to migrate away from freenas jails and onto a proper hypervisor

 Plenty more to come no doubt as I go into the open source rabbit hole :)

                              <span>Run time went from 10min to 50min. Originally UPS came with 10 12v Pb batteries. New battery made of two sets of 20S2P A123 2.5Ah LiFePO4 batteries. 
 Why? Lead acid batteries were leaking when I got the UPS for 100$ and new set of batteries costs around 150$ so bought used LiFePO4 from a recycler and made my own pack. Costed around 200$ plus this will last forever!

                              <span>I&#x27;m running OPNSense in a VM on my server. The motherboard has 2 onboard GBe NICs and one 10/100 (dedicated to the iKVM remote access). I added a 3rd NIC on a PCIE 1x card. The way I have it setup right now is the PCIE NIC connects to the cable modem and is the incoming signal for OPNSense. One of the onboard NICs feeds from the OPNSense VM to the LAN, and the 3rd one is the host OS&#x27;s NIC.
 I have noticed some weirdness with my internet speeds where it will sometimes drop to almost unusable speeds and a reboot of the VM fixes it. 
 Does anybody think it would be beneficial to offload both the OPNSense VMs NICs to an external card such as this: https://www.newegg.com/intel-e1g42et/p/N82E16833106035 ?

                              <span>Hello all
 So long story short few years back i went with Google Nest WiFi and it worked great until Google made some changes and took all setting away so i have zero control over this device. I have 3 of them since it is mesh. Now google also did something with their updates that most 2G WiFi connected devices wont connect and i had to reboot google at lest once a day. to fix this issue i added TP-Link 1GB router and i disabled WAN and 5G and kept only 2G which worked but it was having issues. Since everything is 1G i switched and made TP-Link main unit and Google 2nd this setup worked but now my network is extremely slow and i have keep switching wifi on my laptop back and forth.
 Can someone with more brain power assist here please
 Thanks

 I was given this netapp storage unit for free and I’m trying to set it up for home lab but I can’t find any info about what cables do I need and or what card do I need to buy to connect it to my server. Does any one have any info about this model.
 Thank you in advance and I apologize, my first post here!!

                              <span>I post this just because I occasionally see these for sale on r/homelabsales and elsewhere I picked one up (maybe a year ago). Searching about it yielded not much info - thanks Datto /s. It mostly just sat there as I procrastinated downsizing my homelab. Finally getting around to setting up the hardware I discovered NVMe is not recognized by the bios but post POST the OS can see it. This means I could install an OS on the nvme drive, but couldn&#x27;t boot from it. It&#x27;s nearly identical to the zotac zbox mi522nano (even sharing the same model name) and their updated bios addresses this issue. I was unable to flash the bios via USB/dos or even via windows. I did some searching to see if I could be lazy about it, but why not just try to flash it with the zotac firmware - &#x27;what could possibly go wrong?&#x27;
 Happy to say that using the CH341A (w/ 3.3v mod) and neoprogrammer v2.1.0.19 to flash the zotac bios (Version 2K160308) on the GD25B64C chip did in fact work and after removing the stupid glowing Datto logo and covering it (from inside) with black vinyl tape, you&#x27;d now never know it was a datto box and best of all NVMe boot works as well as using the mPCIe slot for my coral board.
 TL;DR flashing zotac firmware on datto s3x1 worked for me to boot from nvme drive. I had to use CH341a flasher and neoprogrammer software. Posting just for those who may find themselves searching for this in the future as I couldn&#x27;t find even datto firmware update (unsurprisingly).

                              <span>I just built a new 3U ATX rack server with the following specs:
 - Gigabyte X570 Pro Wifi
 - Ryzen 3900X
 - 128GB 3200 DDR4
 - 2x2TB Samsung m.2
 - 2x250GB Samsung SSD (OS drive &amp; cache drive for vsan)
 ​
 The goal is to build another one with matching specs and do a 2 node vSAN build with a 3rd witness node but until then this single node can hold all my VMs I need. 
 This issue im running into is I cannot RAID the m.2 without vSAN on the node (due to a limitation of the X570 mobo). I would have to run two 2TB datastores, which would work but want to RAID them and have a single 4TB datastore. Is there an issue with running a single vSAN node for the time being?Im not worried about data risk, I do daily snapshots with the synology. Once I build the 2nd node I can just add it to vcenter and added it to the vSAN cluster. Would this work or am I better off just running two datastores and migrating everything to the 2nd vSAN node when ready then add the 1st node to the cluster.

 As the title says I&#x27;m looking for a simple hot desk booking system. Bonus points for ldap or similar for authentication. Is there anything like that around?

                              <span>I find that I&#x27;m preferring self-hosted software written in golang or rust simply because I don&#x27;t have to maintain a complex set of dependencies when there are projects written in those languages.
 Do any of you have any recommendations for such software?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I have a few services in my homelab that are reliant upon the apache2 web server.
 There were a few configuration vulnerabilities flagged by my vulnerability scanner with guidance to update the values in httpd.conf ( /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) in the case of ubuntu 20.04 that i&#x27;m running
 I made those changes such as modifying the following values
 (Options None) for root directory
 TraceEnable off 
 ServerTokens ProductOnly 
 ServerSignature off 
 LimitRequestline 512 LimitRequestFields 100 LimitRequestFieldsize 1024 LimitRequestBody 102400 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve however stumbled upon some comments since then that modifying these values directly in the apache2.conf file isn&#x27;t a good practice as that file can occasionally be replaced during a package update and conf.d is preferable. I&#x27;ve also read some conflicting information that the conf.d directory is deprecated
 ​
 ​
 What is currently considered best practice for making persistent config changes such as setting TraceEnable off ?

                              <span>I self host for fun at home and am familiar with docker VMs and networking. I have a work assignment that MS Project would really help with. I just can&#x27;t justify the cost. Is there something similar to MS Project that can be self hosted? I looked into Project Libre desktop and it just doesn&#x27;t have what I&#x27;ve seen in PWA (MS Project Web) before. Having it be accessible on the local network would also allow my assistant to do the updating.
 FWIW I&#x27;m more concerned about tracking financial commitments (projects other people are doing that I&#x27;m funding) that span multiple years, have preliminary budgets, actuals, etc. I&#x27;m not looking for a task management system. There are tons of those.

                              <span>All that I want is a great looking movie library software in which I can assign metadata, filmposters etc. to the (local) files, kinda like iTunes or Musicbee for Music or Playnite and GoG Galaxy for videogames. I don&#x27;t want a server software or have it available on all devices in existence and I don&#x27;t want it to be be configurable rather easily. Is there something like that around?

                              <span>So ive come to the realisation that I need a bit of organisation when I comes to all the stuff on my server. I&#x27;ve got control panels here, VM&#x27;s over there, all running on various ports ips and webserver sub folders.
 I seriously need to keep track of it all. So what I&#x27;m looking for is something like a simple webpage that I can add a list of stuff. Something that looks good and isn&#x27;t just a load of blue links on a webpage. That also scales to mobile/tablet screens.
 I could set each service up with fancy domain names, but I&#x27;d still need a directory of sorts.

                              <span>I have written simple things in the past to upload a file from a webbrowser, process it in some fashion, and split out the output. This has always been something simple for myself, very little regard for Auth n/z, and always felt dangers of running php exec. Now I have a need for something for a small group of people.
 I have used Rundeck in the past, but seems overkill. Anything else out there that can do something like this?

                              <span>I have running Pi4 8gig with Dietpi on board. All going well for media streaming all over devices with help of airsonic/jellyfin/audioboockshelf/tvheadend/samba for the rest.
 The only thing i&#x27;m missing is possibility to listen on the go video files downloaded from different sources and having lections-talking wise content like. I.e. there only audio is having a sense and traffic cost, so the selfhosted server with realtime transcoding mkv/mp4/avi to mp3 will be just best solution.
 Trying to get Airsonic do that for me, unfo can&#x27;t force them to look at the different folders and get out video to mp3 on the fly. Help please if you know how, unless there are better solution available.
 Any recommendation from community. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I love the look of dashboards such as Flame, dashy, homer etc. I love the dashboard views of all my services with the &quot;card&quot; look. But I wish there was a dashboard that had a notes type field where I could add additional detail that I could view. So if I hovered over the service or even right clicked on it, I could view things like the OS, misc information, etc.

                              <span>My self-hosting journey started about two years ago when I discovered both Kubernetes and this amazing sub. Since then I have hosted many applications on Kubernetes. However I found the process not as easy as it could be and for 6 months I have been working on a tool to facilitate the deployment of applications on a Kubernetes cluster → https://openlizz.com.
 I just released a first version of this tool. I&#x27;m already using this tool to manage my own cluster and applications, but it&#x27;s still at an early stage. In addition, the number of compatible applications is currently limited, but I plan to add more soon. The goal of the project is to make self-hosting on Kubernetes easier and more accessible.
 If you are interested, there are two tutorials that show how it can be use: https://openlizz.com/docs/tutorials.
 As I said, this project is in its early stages and I&#x27;m very interested in any feedback, comments, or even maybe contributions.
 GitHub: https://github.com/openlizz/lizz
 Looking forward to discussing in the comments :)

                              <span>Hey I hope everyone is doing great!
 I have an old 2013 laptop laying around. I would love to turn this laptop into a development server. I have the following requirements.
 It must be able to host a web application, primarily dot-net core but not limited to it. Host a database (MSSQL) and use it as a git server. Additionally would be cool if I could play around with Kubernetes on it. 
 I have never in my life did anything infrastructure wise so I wanted to try it out.
 If you have any resources that would help it would be amazing!

                              <span>I have a yi home 1080p dome. A yi home 720 and a yihome 1080p.
 I&#x27;m interested in getting them working with motioneye.
 That is, in fact, done.
 But I was curious about the fact that the chipset changes from all winner, mstar and hi3518.
 I was curious about how easy/hard it would be to 
 1.) Create docker build environments for each chip set, 2.) Unify some builds so that it supports all the different chipsets. 
 I&#x27;ve done a little (poor) work at www.github.com/SimonMcN/yi-hack-Allwinner to try and convert the all winner chipset to hi3518.
 I don&#x27;t know if this is pointless, at the moment it&#x27;s an intellectual exercise I&#x27;m failing with github actions but if someone can explain how I can identify the correct cross compiler prefix without being able to see the files stem in github I&#x27;d appreciate it.
 Cheers

 I am looking for a self-hostable vinted &quot;light&quot;. I would like to provide it for my family and friends. It should really be a minimal version in which you can place things with a price and someone else can buy it. 
 I was not able to find such a software. Does anybody know some?

                              <span>I use filebrowser for general usage. I want to create a python app for my friends (and just to tinker with and learn more coding) that will download files. I want those files to be from something like a static site. I can make the code download from a URL. I would need to host something like a static website to do that.
 I thought about using caddy, but there is no way to protect the webpage. I know i can use authelia to protect the page, but I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;d pass the login credentials through python when trying to download the fike, if it&#x27;s even possible to do that.
 I&#x27;m a real noob at this, just spitballing. Maybe someone understands what I&#x27;m trying to do.

                              <span>My drive&#x27;s health status on CrystalDiskInfo is Caution, when I hover over it - it says:
 Caution [C5] Current Pending Sector Count : 8
 Caution [C6] Uncorrectable Sector Count : 8
 I know it&#x27;s bad, but is it catastrophic? I&#x27;ve seen people with 100+ Uncorrectable sectors being warned that any moment their disk may break down, is the case the same in my situation?
 I am only asking because I need to last with this disk as my main only for a fev weeks, then I will upgrade from this 1TB HDD to a 1TB NVMe SSD as my main drive - I will use this HDD only as backup storage.
 Also, Power On Hours: 25210 (2 years 320 days 10 hours) ;)

                              <span>Not 100% sure this is the exact correct sub but, it&#x27;s still hoarding related.
 So, I&#x27;ve got a TrueNAS VM setup and I was following a guide on setting up the ARRs which involved creating individual media datasets and linking them to their appropriate app. https://schnerring.net/blog/install-qbittorrent-jackett-lidarr-radarr-sonarr-and-plex-inside-truenas-jails/
 That one actually. The problem is, and I&#x27;m only just now realizing this, hardlinks don&#x27;t work properly with that setup, so my 2+tb of media now occupies 4+tb of space and it&#x27;s still growing.
 Currently I&#x27;m running /mnt/NAS/MEDIA/(dataset for respective app according to the guide)
 My question is, is there a way to somehow juggle the files around while I destroy the datasets? Maybe throw everything up to /MEDIA/, create regular corresponding folders, then move it back?
 Also, if I wiped all but the torrent folder, would ARR pick it back up automatically? Or would I have to do an import?

                              <span>Well, since my collections expanded quite substantially over the past year i am nearly out of storage again :/ But this time i am looking for sth that should hopefully last me for the next years. 
 I looked through many cases but most of them are only 24 bay and it feels a bit like wasting space since my rack is also quite full. 
 The case should be:
 - 35+ bays (best would be 48 bay like a Chenbro NR40700)
 - topload for 3.5&quot; bays
 - Standard atx MBs
 - good vibration protection for drives
 - sas 6g (12g would be nice though) backplane
 - ATX Psu would be nice
 - not to loud (fans replaceable) if possible
 - under 1k $ for the case if possible
 So far the only thing that kinda fits this is the Chenbro NR40700 but i havent seen any of them for sale (ebay or reseller / Europe).
 Any recommendations or places where you can still buy those?

                              <span>I just got this update (automatically) from the Google Drive macos client which is described here: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/12178485
  
Introduced by Apple in macOS 12.1, File Provider provides native support for accessing cloud-based file systems like Google Drive. Users who stream files will notice slight differences from the previous experience provided by Drive for desktop. 
 [...] 
 To find streaming files: 
  
Open Finder. 
 
On the left, under &quot;Locations,&quot; click Google Drive. 
 
 Like before, files are not downloaded until actually used. Files that have not been downloaded yet are marked with a cloud icon. 
 Notes: 
 For advanced use cases (e.g. Terminal), you can find your files under ~/Library/CloudStorage. 
 Items in an application&#x27;s recent file lists will not open until they are accessed in their new locations through Spotlight search or in Finder. If you have configured applications to explicitly use file paths referencing Drive for desktop’s streaming drive, you will need to manually change these paths to continue accessing them as you did previously. 
 If you previously had configured your content cache to reside on a secondary volume, your content will be moved to the same volume on which your home directory resides.
  
My question is: now the &quot;location&quot; of my GD is named &quot;Google Drive - &quot; ... is there any way to change this to remove the &quot;Google Drive - &quot; prefix? I find it annoying for various reasons.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m looking to build a budget nas server for video editing and as a media server. 
 I&#x27;m looking at older used pcs to start as a base and I&#x27;m not really sure what to look for spec and power consumption-wise.
 One i was looking at was 150 for
 I7-9700f CPU
 (2) 2133MHZ DDr 4 
 ASRock B360M/OEM LGA 1151 
 Some Nvidia graphics card 
 The other one I was looking at was for 250
 - Intel Xeon E3 1230 Quad Core CPU
 - 16GB DDR3
 - Gigabyte Z77-DS3H Motherboard
 - GTX 1060 3GB GPU
 - Samsung 840 250GB SSD
 - 1TB Toshiba HDD
 - 430W Thermaltake 80+ Power Supply
 ​
 Is either of these decent?

                              <span>I like hoarding my favorite TV shows and comics and movies in a drive. So far I have about 216 GB of data made up of videos (movies and TV), pdfs, and pictures. 
 I mainly plug in the drive occasionally to just watch whatever I want on command. Not that often though. Probably once or twice a month or less. This is my usage. 
 Right now I have it all stored on an external hard drive (G-Drive) and its held up for about 5 years now. 
 How can I back up my Data to keep it safe for long term storage in case the hard drive fails?
 I heard flash drives have less moving parts so theyre better and that SSDs arent good long term if you don&#x27;t use them often? Im a noob at this guys please help. What would you do if you were in my situation?
 Much appreciated

I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to make Storage Spaces use those 8 drives in their term for a RAID6. I can create the Storage Pool with all 8 drives no problem. When I create the parity Virtual Disk it errors out. I can create a mirror Virtual Disk with no issue, but that wastes half my space. Any option I chose for parity Virtual Disk fails, whether it is single (raid5 equivalent) or dual (raid 6 equivalent), and whether I choose thin or fixed provisioning, and whether I do the maximum size or put in a smaller size, and all combinations of all those options.
 The error is: &quot;The storage pool does not have sufficient eligible resources for the virtual disk&quot;, despite it…</span>

                              <span>I am looking for an external hard drive with 8TB. Ideally something that is fast. 
 I am tempted towards WD black which is at a steep discount on Amazon:
 https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-8TB-Game-Drive-WDBA3P0080HBK-NESN/dp/B07XVB7G99/ref&#x3D;sr_1_9?crid&#x3D;358XHOG0PA9W3&amp;keywords&#x3D;8tb+external+hard+drive&amp;qid&#x3D;1665079978&amp;qu&#x3D;eyJxc2MiOiI1LjA2IiwicXNhIjoiNC41MiIsInFzcCI6IjMuNzUifQ%3D%3D&amp;s&#x3D;electronics&amp;sprefix&#x3D;8tb+external+hard+drive+%2Celectronics%2C88&amp;sr&#x3D;1-9&amp;ufe&#x3D;app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.f5122f16-c3e8-4386-bf32-63e904010ad0
 However, it seems that it has a proprietary port instead of a usb-c? Shall I go for a external hard drive with usb-c? Are there more competitive/better external hard drives than this?

 Before the end of the year, I plan on downloading around and potentially more than 15TB&#x27;s of Linux distro isos. The primary source will be over torrents, in which I need to be a good datahoarder and seed back, but the torrents are not necessarily in demand. With my current internet connection, 15TB&#x27;s would take a minimum of two months to upload. I am using some seedbox activity an in attempt to upload faster. Seedboxes over a certain TB are not practical cost-wise. The other source will be over Usenet. The usenet process is manual with the use of Newsbin Pro 64. I download articles, I search articles, I download everything under that search term (avoiding the redflags), and then filter through the downloads, eliminating corrupted files by checking the CRC, which is com…</span>

 But outside of looking at it randomly, do you do anything with the data? Feel safe just knowing it&#x27;s there?
 Do you do any research, projects, mess around in some way? Or is it the journey of being able to fulfilling enough?

                              <span>Today I arrived at work and all the computers were down. Probably there was an outage during the night. Everything went back to normal except our rack RS1219+ was dead, even having its own dedicated UPS.
 It’s probably the power module, I know.
 While we recover from this nightmare that at the very least (and hopefully only) will put us back 10 days behind schedule, I want to know HOW THE F**K this can happen, and how can I avoid this in the future.
 Any advice?

                              <span>Hiya Gang,
 As a long-time lurker and superfan of this subreddit, just wanted to throw out a huge thanks for all the sage sysadmin advices I’ve gotten here over the years as I’ve built out my movie collection and servers. Respect!
 To that end, I was curious about the group’s opinions about a few things:
 - Most of my films are 1080p RARBG releases, with the audio encoded in AAC.
 - Is AAC a viable codec for maximum compatibility with a range of devices(receivers)?
 - I’ve considered re-encoding / Downloading my media recently.. to (AC3, DD?)
 So that‘s got me wonderin about how folks feel about downloading h265 movies?
 (I’m after direct-play compatibility for a max range of devices above all other priorities)
 Are peeps still waiting to switch, waiting for AV1 Maturity, etc before upgrading their libraries?.

                              <span>I recently bought a WD Ultrastar DC HC550 18TB (WUH721818ALE6L4) and I have noticed really inconsistent read/write speeds, with Win10 task manager showing often 100% &quot;active time&quot; even when it&#x27;s not doing much transfer. The disk behaves quite &quot;bursty&quot;, eg it works good for a short while, then slows down to a halt for a while, and repeats. https://i.imgur.com/OSqOQen.png
 I searched around and only found typical &quot;disable superfetch&quot; and such results. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s nothing wrong with my system, I haven&#x27;t had this problem before with any other drives.
 Here is the information from CrystalDiskInfo, showing caution on &quot;Current Pending Sector Count&quot;. Is it probable I got a bad disk, or what should I do next you guys think? Thanks for any ideas!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve ever seen a deletion quite like this for a videogame. Such a short amount of time before the game was just completely replaced by it&#x27;s successor. While it is a relatively new game, it still seems like a huge blow to the games preservation community. Is it even possible that someone could have a copy of Overwatch 1 considering the nature of the game? I think it&#x27;s a very interesting case, maybe it hasn&#x27;t had too much effect so far, but I&#x27;m interested to see how it affects the future. I just hope this does not set a precedent for other game companies, as this would be a terrible practice to start seeing commonplace.

                              <span>I used to visit this one subreddit, but then it got banned because of lack of moderators, and now I can&#x27;t find the videos anymore. so I searched for HOURS on how to find banned and deleted things, and eventually found Punshift.io, and found the link to the video I wanted. But none of the archive websites I found would display images or videos, only comments, and reddit video downloaders don&#x27;t work either, because the video is banned. so at some point, I decided to try The Wayback Machine, and, that actually worked. I saw the video appear like normal, BUT, I couldn&#x27;t watch it, because it was continuously loading. also, the &quot;save post&quot; and &quot;share&quot; options don&#x27;t work, so I don&#x27;t know what to do. If anyone knows how to download or watch these anyway, please tell me!

Should I create a separate partition for Mac backups? I&#x27;m planning on building a custom NAS soon and just want to be sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it with both setups.

 Is there a separate application (preferably GUI) for this?
 I’d like to keep the files uncompressed so that I can open them and access files whenever I want to but if that’s not an option, does right clicking on a folder and clicking on Compress “Folder Name” work well?

                              <span>Hello guys !
 I&#x27;ve been using [Joplin] for some time now. I really like it.
 Nevertheless, I will like to be able to edit folder and files outside Joplin. This means being able to recognize which file is which by having names and folder as well.
 ​
 Do you know any application that is able or resemble to it ? 
 It can be hosted in my server or, as Joplin, be a desktop application that can be linked to my nextcloud.
 ​
 Thanks very much !

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for the best (free) option for making Minecraft work outside of my home network and, if possible, with my own domain. 
 I&#x27;m currently running a sup&#x27;d up Synology DS720+ with docker images serving Minecraft, Plex, and other apps. I have Cloudflared and mydomain.com set up to limit exposure. I understand Cloudflare only handles HTTP traffic, and it does so swimmingly but does not address Minecraft. If possible, I would like to point to minecraft.mydomain.com. I&#x27;m only expecting 4-6 concurrent users at most.
 Has anyone done this successfully with a similar setup? If so, I appreciate your guidance!

 Just wondering what people would think. If not then I have other machines I can host the NAS on. I&#x27;m just trying to plan the best usage for the different machines I have.
  
The website will consist of the website itself, blog, wiki, forums etc.
 It will also be exposed to the internet.
  
Thanks in advance,

 Current student and Sysadmin for my school, I&#x27;d like to throw up a custom instance of a group study room app like what&#x27;s available at https://fiveable.me, and it seems like a pretty simple SPA, but I don&#x27;t know if someone&#x27;s already remade it yet?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for a self hosted help ticket system that would allow the users of my media server to request help. I&#x27;m looking for a solution that can connect through OpenID / OIDC or SAML or LDAP (least prefered) so they can use the same account on it. I&#x27;m looking for something very simple, just simple text tickets that allow me to answer them. Does it exists ?
 If possible, I would like a solution that is available as a docker image.
 Thanks in advance for your help, have a great day

 Casual Reminder: Self-Hosted Defined
 I have seen an influx of confusion about what does and does not qualify as &quot;self-hosted&quot; as defined by what is and is not allowed in this subreddit. So, let me pull from the link in the sidebar/wiki
  
Self-Hosting, as it pertains to the /r/selfhosted subreddit, is any software that the user who puts said software into place has whole control over the hosting environment either at the Operating System level or at the level where they fully control all data pertinent to the software being hosted, including data related to the func…</span>

 So I think it&#x27;s finally time to create a dedicate post for my personal project KitchenOwl. I&#x27;ve mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.
 KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven&#x27;t cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.
 If you&#x27;re interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.
 Why did I create KitchenOwl?
 Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That&#x27;s when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That&#x27;s when I decided to just create my own app.
 It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.

 Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.

 I have a Synology DS213 with 2 4TB drives currently in RAID1.
 I don&#x27;t want anymore only 4TB available with parity but just the plain 8TB.
 What do I need to do to achieve this? Do I need to format all?
 Thanks all!

 Hackertarget.com have a very nice website where you can run nmap scans from a web-based front end and then get and download the report.
 Since they only use open-source tools like nmap / mass scan does anyone know of a system that I can install to get the same service?

                              <span>Hi, I am facing a problem with my Nginx config.
 My goal is to have a „utility” server where I can access tools like Umami, Uptime Kuma etc. The preferred way to access Umami Analytics would be via umami.domain.com.
 Expected behaviour should look something like:
 umami.domain.com → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 Current behaviour:
 umami.domain.com → JSON Response (from Nginx Proxy Manager)
 umami.domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 ​
 ​
 Nginx Config
 ​
 Question:
 How can I route my localhost:3000 port to umami.domain.com without specifying a port in the URL?
 ​
 I understand that this might be an error due to my limited understanding of networking and proxying therefore I would appreciate any recommendations for further reading or a basic introduction to networking
 ​
 Tech stack:
  
Docker
 Umami Analytics
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 NameCheap Domain Name
 Small VPS
  
​
 The JSON response: {&quot;status&quot;:&quot;OK&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:{&quot;major&quot;:2,&quot;minor&quot;:9,&quot;revision&quot;:18}}

                              <span>So I don&#x27;t want to get doxxed, so I got a VPS with a static IPv4 which has all ports open. I want to use this VPS to do something like CloudFlare Tunnels (which I currently use), except I want to host it myself, want privacy and want to learn how this all would work. I host a few dozens of websites/web apps, which I currently use different ports for, using the CloudFlare Tunnels. Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to access my reolink webcam from outside of my local network without directly exposing it to the internet. Wireguard works for me but the WAF(wife acceptance factor) is not very high.
 A simple web UI with authentication would be nice. I don&#x27;t need any motion detection or advanced stuff.

 e.g. if I have python code I want that logging to go to the logging solution and have that update live so that I can have it open &amp; updating on a separate screen while coding
 Can anyone think of something that does that?

 Bonus points if it offers some means of sending a notification whenever a file is uploaded.

 EDIT 1: Adding this to the top because im getting loads of comments about why even bother becoming my own CA and how this is totally wrong and i should use product/app XYZ. I know there are other ways of doing this and apps/containers to help facilitate that, i explored all of them but chose not to use them. If you heavily invested in docker/containers then yes use one of those methods, but if your just starting out with docker/containers and still want to have a bit of extra security at no cost, then take a look at this method. Im going to list the reasons i did it this way, the major one being i just started out with docker recently but i saw 99% of containers run in HTTP or its a PITA to get HTTPS working, i wanted to wrap all my traffic in HTTPS in a very simple way and found…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I am a little new to the world of reverse proxies and, in general, self hosting. In the past I have port forwarded for wireguard and ssh. Just recently, I&#x27;ve managed to setup a free Pbx box and got that all going. Port 443, 80, clearly Ip, and then a udp port range of 10001 to 20000.
 All works but then I thought that it was a little exposing. Nginx proxy manager, vanilla nginx, traefik, not sure it&#x27;s possible. Standard 443 and 80 is pretty straight forward, however, a port range seemed a little more complex.
 Ssh forwarded through I think is what they call the stream option in nginx. Can that be done in nginx proxy manager too? Reading into it it seems that nginx can do a port range too but I&#x27;m just not clear on it.
 Has anyone done this or would be kind enough to offer their two cents?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just purchased a VPS from Ionos (UK, for £1 per month (£1.20 after VAT)). It&#x27;s 1 cpu core and 512Mb ram. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m going to use it for, but I&#x27;m thinking I might host a small site on it.
 With these limited specs is this feasable? Using docker, how many services might this support? The ram sounds really low, especially as my pi4 has 4GB.

I am wanting to secure this further and add authentication to the reverse proxy so that once I authenticate I can get to all the apps behind the reverse proxy without singing in again. I have heard of Authelia and maybe that&#x27;s what I should use? I am not sure. What would you suggest? Am I even going about securing this the correct way?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a setup where I send my CCTV image to Doods for people detection, whenever a human is detected I send a notification to my phone with the image. What I want to do is also save this file to a directory, for review purpose, so that i can look back and see how many times there something was detected. 
 What I need is a suggestion for a photogallery that can let me see all these images easily. What i am looking for is something simple, I dont need metadata tagging or AI processing in the gallery, just need something that can scroll through all the images , grouped by time ( per day, per week etc ).
 I already have photoprism as the gellery for my actual photos and its just overkill for this purpose.

                              <span>hi guys!
 apologies for being basic
 im a noob who wants to tinker
 non exhaustive or mutually exclusive list of things to explore: - maybe a web server - plex - docker - kubernetes - proxmox - unraid - or whatever sounds fun
 previously ran basic basic ML (scikit), crypto nodes, trading bots, pihole, emulators
 am I biting off more than I can chew? is it obviously wiser to go a different route? is my gf gunna be pissed if she sees this?
 feel free to bash me up
 arguably i need some wisefolk to talk me out of this :)

                              <span>I just created a SMB share atop a zfs pool on Proxmox.
 I have OneDrive synced on my PC, and I&#x27;m looking for utility to do a scan periodically and copy new files to the share as a second copy.
 Can someone suggest such a utility, or similar ones that I can modify to fit my needs? I haven&#x27;t done any Win32/C# programming for a long time...
 Personally I&#x27;ve never dealt with real NAS system, and I wonder if this is some basic support from NAS, to run a deamon to monitoring and sync...
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have an APC Smart-UPS X 1500 UPS (FW 09.1 (ID20)) and would like to disable Green Mode. However, there is no option available in the location described in the APC support documentation, nor can I find it anywhere else in the web interface or front display. I have another APC UPS ( Smart-UPS X 2000) and the option is there and I disabled it. Google hasn&#x27;t provided any useful results, so thought I&#x27;d ask here.

 Does anyone know if these specific laptop CPUs fully support all aspects of Hyper-V including nesting?

                              <span>I just bought a Z440 motherboard and E5-2680v4 off eBay for a new Proxmox system, and so far everything is working fine. The only issue is that on startup, I get a few POST errors that I can only bypass by pressing enter. Obviously this is not ideal considering I&#x27;m not going to have a keyboard or display attached to this PC. Is there any way to disable these messages? I&#x27;ve looked through all the BIOS settings and I didn&#x27;t find anything, but I know some manufacturers hide settings behind certain keybinds.
 Is it even worth the hassle or would I be better off just buying one of these generic x99 motherboards so I wouldn&#x27;t have to deal with any of these issues that come with proprietary parts from old prebuilts?

                              <span>On the one hand I really wanna try hosting Mastodon to see what it&#x27;s like, and that doesn&#x27;t seem to work with a local DNS server providing the domain. On the other, the only other thing to use it for (at the moment) would be hosting my website, which is already comfy at Netlify. Is it worth the $36 (edit: per 10yrs), or a waste? Also, if anyone can give me tips on getting Mastodon up and running with Docker Compose I would appreciate it, online guides have been lackluster.

                              <span>Sorry if this is a noob question but I&#x27;m trying to change the root directory of my Apache server to a Samba share folder. (My hope is to be able to edit the html/php files from my Windows computer) I&#x27;m running Ubuntu Server 20.04 on a Raspberry Pi 4. When I try to access the webpage, I get the forbidden access message. I have changed apache2.conf and 000-default.conf. I have set the file permissions. Still no dice.
 I am a bit confused as to what the filepath is to my Samba folder. Seems to be /home/ubuntu/share/websites. If anybody has a bright idea I&#x27;d love to hear it. I&#x27;m probably just doing something stupid but I can&#x27;t figure it out, and I&#x27;m really not sure where else to go for help.
 Thanks in advance for any help with this!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m pretty new to homelab stuff and want to get myself a server rack at home. I was searching Dutch eBay and found a Scalar i80 tape storage archive. I already have my eyes on a server on which I want to run TrueNas, but I wanted to know if I could send a backup to the i80. 
 I tried googling but no luck there. I don&#x27;t really know much about tape storage. Can anyone help?

                              <span>I recently had a cheap PCIe SATA card die in my server. A friend gave me a l3-25239-07d a long time ago and I&#x27;d like to finally use it. However, I can&#x27;t find much about it.
 Is it possible to run this without RAID? I need to use it to add SATA ports to my server and can&#x27;t use RAID since it is going to be pooled with Drivepool anyway.
 If not, what do you recommend to add 4 SATA ports via PCIe? I don&#x27;t need anything high performance. Just needs to be reliable.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I found a review from the linux experiment about the DeskMini UM350 and was wondering if it&#x27;d be a suitable home server.
 The things I&#x27;d be running on it: A Minecraft server for me and my friend, Pi-Hole, and maybe an unturned server, but it&#x27;d never run along with the MC server.
 Current setup: An old HP notebook with 4gb of ram and an AMD E2-7110 APU with AMD Radeon R2 graphics running Arch Linux (only reason I didn&#x27;t go with something like Debian is I just wanted to learn Arch Linux)
 I really don&#x27;t expect much from it, and I&#x27;m not worried about noise or anything from it, as it&#x27;s gonna be running from a shelf in my basement that already has a loud freezer right next to it. Would this be a reasonable upgrade?

                              <span>Hello fellow homelab professionals.
 This question should be fairly easy for any of you who have a TP-Link sfp/sfp+ switch.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at getting a TP-Link TL-SX3008F but have been holding off for a while as I&#x27;m unsure about their SFP+ module support. Being in Canada I would like to get my modules from fs.com as they are cheaper and I don&#x27;t have to worry about shipping across the border. 
 I would be using single mode fiber with an LC connector 
 Now here is my problem:
 None of the SFP+ modules list a compatibility with TP-Link devices (see here) so I have been unsure if either:
  
They are unable to make it work with TP-Link.
 They are all compatible and TP-Link switches don&#x27;t care.
 Or TP-Link&#x27;s SFP+ interface is actually not their own brand and just uses like a generic Cisco or Intel chip so should work with either.
  
I just have not been able to find anything that says TP-Link other then this one on amazon which is still pretty cheap but I&#x27;m worried that being rated for 10km I&#x27;ll end up burning it out on runs shorter then 10ft

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d share the (admittedly absurd) evolution of my home network setup and upgrade to my Plex server.
 When we first bought our home in 2014, a huge selling point was that the previous owner had wired the whole house with CAT-6e. He left us a simple router and patch panel mounted to the wall in the outside office.
 Humble beginnings
 After we moved in, I installed my modem, a modest Cisco router, a 24-port Netgear switch, and housed my Plex library on two Netgear ReadyNAS devices. I spend a lot of time organizing and perfecting my media library, so I added a Synology DiskStation NAS with equal storage capacity to run nightly delta backups of anything added to the media library—and all of the NAS&#x27;s have a 1-disk fault tolerance.
 Everything was housed on wire-rack shelving, with a sma…</span>

                              <span>Does such a device exist? I know some ISPs provide redundancy via the mobile network for when the main line drops, but is there a standalone device I can buy that I can throw a pre paid sim card with some data on it that will take over in the event my main connection drops? Preferably automatic. Obviously I can manually hotspot via my phone, but ideally im looking for something to integrate into my network that is more or less set and forget.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have a FreeNas system and I made a 2TB target I also have a 3 node Proxmox Cluster.
 Once I connect the single 2TB target to the DataCenter in Proxmox is it possible to split this single target to several VMs kinda like how you make VMs in local drive like assigning them some portion of the 2TB lets say VM1 (DNS DHCP Role) 250GB on Node1 and VM2 (Cups Print Server) another 250GB
 on Node2 and so on?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not sure if this would be possible or not but I figure this is the best place to ask! 
 I have two main home servers, one hosting a webserver and the other hosting a Nextcloud server. I have a dynamic IP on my router/from my ISP that I&#x27;m using in conjunction with duckdns.org instead of a proper Dynamic DNS service (if that makes any difference). 
 Basically I&#x27;d like to be able to access both the webserver &amp; the Nextcloud server externally by simply visiting &quot;.duckdns.org/websrv&quot; &amp; &quot;.duckdns.org/nextcloud. Is there a way I could set it up to access my webserver with http &amp; https then have /nextcloud connect my Nextcloud Server? 
 I have a couple of solutions I&#x27;ve come up with myself that solve the issue, but not perfectly for me. I could use different ports of course for both of them, but then I wouldn&#x27;t be able to access them through normal web browsing without adding the ports. 
 And of course I could move the nextcloud srv to the web server or vica versa, but that wouldn&#x27;t be ideal for me either. 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi guys. Looking to build a homelab server and upgrade from my microserver gen8
 Looking to build inside a 3u chassis with likely 6-8 hotswap drive bays. (Also looking for a case)
 I have lots of experience building PCs, but I&#x27;m not sure how it differs between building a PC and building a server. What differences in motherboards/CPU&#x27;s should I be looking into? 
 I don&#x27;t need to be building a monster, but I would like a power efficient decently powerful machine for NAS, VM&#x27;s, and several dockers. I&#x27;ll also be running plex so transcoding might be necessary

                              <span>I have an UnRAID server that I used MergerFS to make &quot;shortcuts&quot; as I couldn&#x27;t make symlinks on UnRAID for some reason.
 This has come to bite me as I&#x27;m moving to TrueNAS. 
 I merge many directories this way on boot: 
  /bin/mergerfs -o use_ino,cache.files&#x3D;partial,dropcacheonclose&#x3D;true,allow_other,category.create&#x3D;mfs &quot;/mnt/user/Development/2022/United States Customers&quot; &quot;/mnt/user/Current Projects/USA&quot; 
 If I run the command above before I rsync my data to the new server, all the files will be duplicated on both left and right directories.
 If I don&#x27;t run the command above before I rsync, I&#x27;ll have some files in the left side directory, and some in the right side directory. 
 Essentially I want to move/consolidate all files in the original (left side) directory, so I can rsync everything.
 Could anyone please suggest a way to fix this fuck up? Much appreciated. 
 I found mergerfs.consolidate on https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools but I&#x27;m not sure of the right syntax or if it&#x27;s indeed intended to fix this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to have a dependable local backup solution. From 1 hard driver to another
 I&#x27;m backing up a hard drive to another using Veeam free agent for windows. as a secondary option I&#x27;m also syncing the whole hard drive to another using FreeFileSync. so to summarize: 1 hard drive is being backed up onto 2 different hard drives, one being handled by Veeam and the other by FreeFileSync... all on the same PC
 I&#x27;m yet to actually use Veeam for recovery (fingers crossed) but what I&#x27;ve noticed is that the Veeam backup is almost twice the size of the source hard drive. Is that normal? if so, why is that?

                              <span>I am moving to a new house that has a fast enough internet connection to get everything I have into the cloud as a backup. Because of the 30TBish of storage I require I will be using my University Alumni Google Drive account (Managed by University IT). For my Synology I&#x27;m going to use Hyper Backup for encrypted NAS backups. I do also have a stack of external drives that I&#x27;m using for my Plex Server. I&#x27;d like to get these files uploaded but encrypted for obvious reasons. What&#x27;s the most recommended Windows application I can use to encrypt and backup? Keep in mind I don&#x27;t have the storage space to duplicate the files with encryption, so I&#x27;d like to either have on-the-fly encryption or an automated &quot;encrypt a file, upload file, delete the locally encrypted file&quot; type of workflow.

                              <span>I couldn&#x27;t find any good explanation of the attributes and their values. Just some results from forums pretty much like &quot;Looks good&quot;, &quot;Bad drive&quot;,...
 Is there any site I can find attribute and their vendor specific value explanation?
 As for my drive, I just noticed way too much seeking and extreme slowdowns when I copied over larger file without other such demanding tasks. I run Manjaro, not Windows, so if not in active use, it&#x27;s doing almost nothing in background.
 S.M.A.R.T. data:

                              <span>Hi all
 I have a few hard drives I want to backup to my 16tb hdd. I tried using Windows to backup the drives but it doesn&#x27;t seem to want to work.
 What&#x27;s the easiest way to just carbon copy backup my files? I have tried programmes in the past to backup but they always end up making some weird ISO type file backup and I don&#x27;t want that.
 Thanks for any advice you can give

                              <span>Title paints a pretty clear picture I reckon. Let me preface this by saying I have shucked about 5 MyBooks with this exact method without it failing me.
 The drive is recognized when I use the included PCB, it was formatted to ExFat, but I read that could be causing the problem so I formatted to NTFS.
 Whenever I try to use it as an internal drive, the whole system doesn&#x27;t boot. I&#x27;ve blocked the 3.3v. Multiple times with tape and finally with a box cutter. The drive still spins up when it&#x27;s connected internally, but I don&#x27;t get past a bios flash.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve always been under the impression that once a drive starts getting reallocated sectors, it&#x27;s starting to reach the end of its usable life
 I have a RAID 6 array with 7*4TB Seagate IronWolf drives. One of the drives has a slowly increasing number of &quot;Reallocated_Sector_Ct&quot;, currently at just over 1000
 As the drive is under warranty still, I asked Seagate if they would accept an RMA, to which they&#x27;ve told me:
 &quot;in the matter of bad blocks, having bad blocks (also known as sectors) on a drive does not make the drive faulty, over the lifetime of a drive, you may find many thousands of sectors may occur, and these will be re-allocated to other sectors on the drive&quot;
 Am I just being overly cautious?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently using mdadm raid6 11x18TB ext4 in a Debian system.
 I feel that the raid is slow for some scenarios I&#x27;m currently planning and I&#x27;d like to add a nvme cache disk but seems like mdadm doesn&#x27;t support that feature.
 I&#x27;ve seen bcachefs and lvm-cache as options but both would require formatting the raid. Having to backup and restore more than 100TB of data would require a very long service downtime and I&#x27;d prefer not to.
 Any solution that I&#x27;m not aware of that would allow me to add a cache disk woithout having to backup/restore all my data?
 In case there&#x27;s none what would you do? Zfs ? lvm-cache? bcachefs? other?
 thanks

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I have a few basic questions that I couldn&#x27;t find in the wiki or FAQ for those who have time. I am just starting to get into data preservation now that I am starting a family and want to make sure nothing is lost. I am trying to plan out where and how to back up my data in a way that makes sense and this sub has been very helpful.
 For my longer term back-ups, I was planning on buying a couple external HDDs and storing one at my home and one at my office. My plan is to refresh the data on these every 6 months from my working data (local nextcloud server). If I do this, do I need to bother checking the quality of the data to make sure no data has been lost/corrupted? Would best practice to be completely re-write the data to the drives as opposed to updating only deltas to assure no data is lost? Sorry if that is a super basic question. 
 Finally, are there any recommendations for external HDDs to look at? Seems to be a ton of options and its hard to pin-point what is best for my use case. I require &lt;10 TB capacity with relatively infrequent read/writes. The top priority being reliability.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey guys. I’m starting to build my own home server. It’s gonna be used as a media server. A game server. And a NAS. I’m going to need a lot of storage. My case can take 4 2.5 inch drives. 6 3.25 drives. And 3 DVD drive bays and a single NVME drive but I’ve got tonne of pcie ports if I wanna expand. My questions is what would be the best capacity drives to file these bays?
 Ideally I want 4 SSD as quick storage for things like editing pictures and videos as well as working software projects. With the 6 hard drives being deep storage as well as games and videos and stuff for the media server. I was also thinking about converting those DVD bays into hard drive bays if possible

                              <span>I&#x27;m a huge fan of documentaries and last year they dropped a 10 part &#x27;The Center Seat: 55 Years of Star Trek&#x27; documentary on a number of services and cable TV. While piracy is common thing better than a 720p rip of this docu series released and in not the best quality. I&#x27;m not above buying documentaries I want to keep and re-watch once or twice per year but that usually means buying the DVD or BluRay and ripping that. This... I&#x27;m pretty sure won&#x27;t see a BluRay release. But it is on iTunes at 1080p! But I&#x27;m not stupid and I&#x27;m not paying for DRM controlled media that only runs through Apple Software.
 So my question is, if I purchased the full &#x27;season&#x27; set off iTunes, how could strip out the DRM without re-encoding the video through any lossy process so I could have the docu series to freely rewatch and enjoy for years to come?
 I obviously tried Googling but this is a topic with fairly high SEO for &#x27;handy but scammy retail apps&#x27; and I have no idea how to tell the BS from the useful software.

                              <span>So it finally happened, after 30isn years of computing, I&#x27;ve finally gotten a hard drive to die on me. 
 I bought a 6TB WD HDD exactly a year ago. It&#x27;s the Western Digital 6TB WD Blue PC Internal Hard Drive HDD - 5400 RPM, SATA 6 Gb/s, 256 MB Cache, 3.5&quot; - WD60EZAZ for anyone wondering.
 Anyways, I was copying files from my Note 9 to my dropbox folder on this drive when all a sudden the drive could not be found. Thats weird. THen I heard beeps coming from the hard drive every few seconds. Tried everything, and plugged the hard drive into my hard drive dock on my other computer. Nothing. Doesn&#x27;t even recognizes the drive. 
 I used it mostly as my local storage for google drive and dropbox so luckily nothing there was lost. I did lose all of my lightroom photo organization trees and a bunch …</span>

                              <span>So I had an ssd failure recently the data&#x27;s mostly backed up but I wanna cover my bases and pull as much from the ssd as possible. I used rsync with an ssd adapter to pull all the data (a little over 600gb) to my other computer. Is there a GUI utility to checksum every file and tell me what files differ? If not is there a command line utility? I tried teracopy at first but it seems to fail with that many files. I want a GUI utility mostly cause I&#x27;m scared shitless of deleting everything and I know some sectors have read problems. I wanna know what files I gotta pull from my back ups and which are fine to keep on my hdd
 Edit: my back up server is at a family members place with a data cap so I&#x27;d rather not pull ever file only the ones that are corrupt

                              <span>This sub gets a new &quot;what do you hoard&quot; thread every week, which this is kind of like - but a more interesting take on it. It&#x27;s not unreasonable that people here don&#x27;t exactly want to share their hoard, but if you&#x27;ve uploaded to archive.org, it&#x27;s meant to be preserved - which presumably means that people should see it. Also, y&#x27;all probably have some really insightful responses with stories behind them, rather than the usual linux isos / steam games / movies / porn.
 I&#x27;ll start:
 On March 4 2019, the Facebook page &quot;I made this page to bully shitty doge pages&quot; (now renamed &quot;I made this page to shitpost about alcohol lmao&quot;) ran a series called &quot;Doge Noir&quot;. Throughout the entire day, they&#x27;d continuously post a bunch of images that all told one overarching story, one at a time. 
 I guess the best comparison would be like a webcomic? But webcomics are usually posted on multiple platforms and have their own website or something. By the time the day was over, if you wanted to revisit this obscure story, you&#x27;d have to dig up an ancient Facebook meme page. At least until it got an animated adaptation. 
 You can check out my reupload of Doge Noir here. 
 Is this worth archiving? Well, the whole thing is a whopping 7MB, so I&#x27;m not exactly straining their data centers with this. I thought it was pretty entertaining. The ending was funny. Doge is my favorite meme, so maybe I&#x27;m biased.

                              <span>Hello
 At the moment I am using a dedicated server from OVH for 100$/mo.
 Spec: Intel Xenon 6c/12t, 64GB ram, 450 SSD NVE.
 Today I am thinking about alternatives and founded SSDNodes.com. I thinking about planning a performance VPS for 138/166$ year, but it is really working well? Do these guys have a price minimum of 50% cheaper than competitors, maybe people from this subreddit have an opinion about them?

 I just need it to display counts from an API (WordPress REST API) The API is up and running just need a pretty way to display the data on a big screen.
 Anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>So, in my CS study our team of 3 has to create an application of any type. It should only be something to deploy via docker and is splitted in microservices. We want to create something that people can actually make use of.
 What type of application do you wish us to create?

 I&#x27;m Vihar from Appsmith, and I&#x27;m here to share some major updates on Appsmith&#x27;s latest releases. 
 In September, we went up a major version in preparation for the curtain raiser on two big features coming real soon—granular access controls and audit logs. We also made native GraphQL available in Appsmith, added a view for console logs, and shipped a whole raft of other improvements. 
 Appsmith is an open-source framework to quickly build any custom business software like admin panels, internal tools, dashboards, and more with pre-built UI widgets that connect to any database, GraphQL or REST API, controlling everything with Javascript. Appsmith can be self-hosted and runs on Docker, K8s.

 We are looking for a CMS system to rotate videos at a few of our front desks in a few offices. We have 3 raspberry pi 4&#x27;s that we want to use to play the videos, but want the video/content hosted on a server. Any recommendations on what to use? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone !
 I&#x27;m trying to get up and running my server with debian 11.
 ​
 The first two, and for the moment, only apps I want to get running are Gitea and OpenProjects.
 I got good and running gitea thanks to this helpful tutorial : https://golb.hplar.ch/2018/06/self-hosted-git-server.html
 The gitea instance is good and running.
 Now I&#x27;m trying to get running OpenProjects with Caddy but can seem to get the configuration right for the caddy server. Do you have any configuration hanging somewhere in your room ? 
 I found in the documentation the following
  
function as the web server forwarding to our internal server listening at localhost:6000 by proxying.
  
Hence I did in my caddy configuration : 
 openprojects.siteweb.fr{ reverse_proxy localhost:6000 } 
 But when going to the site it does not work, since the &quot;secure connection failed&quot;
 As a wider question, I&#x27;m really struggling with all this servers and redirections and subdomains and where the app is... and I cannot find any good tutorials online to understand how to implement and where to search or write what, I&#x27;m open for any good books/videos/tutorials :)

                              <span>Hi, I have an old Dell laptop (windows) that I want to convert into a server that can do 3 things:
  
File server 
 Media server 
 Remote Retro Gaming server
  
Apart from that, if it can run Onlyoffice and extend to other server apps that would be a bonus.
 I&#x27;ve been reading a lot but the information is all over the place and though I think I can get a NAS running I&#x27;m not sure how the rest of the 2 would work or which approach is beginner friendly/quick to execute.
 I&#x27;ve had experience with linux and I can casually use it. I&#x27;m unsure about what kind of stack to run. I&#x27;d want to have windows installed as sometimes I do get stuff that I need done on it (maybe a remote desktop access as well)
 I would love it if anyone can point me in the right direction.

I love notion and its structure is perfect but this is for a personal group of people for a hobby so I do not want to pay $8 a month per user especially since we&#x27;d have nearly 150 users.
 A requirement would be that it allows role based access so I can limit normal members access to some information while allowing a higher level of information access to other members.

 spotify_sync is a CLI app that can be configured and scheduled to download multiple Spotify accounts. Let me know what you think.

 Edit: Songs are matched to Deezer via ISRC and ultimately downloaded from there

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Kinda new to home servers, need help configuring things in the best way.
 My setup:
  
An Ubuntu laptop as my server - where all of my containers run.
 Asustor NAS
 Other clients are just my TV/PC.
  
My current setup works great, no issues at all. I just want to make things cleaner and easier for me, and to learn.
 My goal: putting together a DNS server to access stuff locally on my LAN using host names instead of IP/ports.
 Tools I need:
  
DNS server - pihole will be ok?
 reverse proxy - I saw nginx is recommended.
  
I would like everything to be dockerized, as I don&#x27;t have additional hardware like pi hole, or another server.
 When I run compose-up, I get a default network named after my stack. So the containers are all running in trash network (named after these guides that taught me how to setup plex and *arr apps).
 The only container not in that network is Plex, it&#x27;s in host mode.
 So my question is about the DNS server. How do I configure Pi Hole to be the main DNS server for my entire home network? Should I run it in host network? will the Ubuntu server become my DNS server technically? Can I configure my ISP router to point to that server&#x27;s IP?
 Hope I didn&#x27;t make a mess of my questions.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Basically I would like a nice GUI that&#x27;s web accessible for me to access and download game files to install and play my personally own games. I know GOG Galaxy and Steam do this but only for the games you have purchased through them. 
 I have a ton of old PC games that I have ripped to my storage and really don&#x27;t want to have to purchase them again, if it&#x27;s even possible to find them. Right now I have them all stored in TrueNAS, and have the folder shared to Owncloud, which works. But I would like it to manage my games folder like one of the arrs, Plex, Steam style interface. Any suggestions?

 So far I love it :) Before I used Heimdall and then Homer as my dashboard.
 I would love to run some more services in my homelab but unfortunately where I live I can only get maximum 25Mbps DL and 5Mbps UL FTTC connection.
 I am on 5G now as my main broadband and speeds are better (can get up to 600 Mbps DL and 50 Mbps UL) but sometimes they drop drastically for few days. Still far better then slow FTTC.

 P.S. - Diagram.net is possible to self host but my server is too weak to handle it.
 P.S - Solution was to use nextcloud apps that has both excalidraw and draw.io integration.
 Thanks all for the help

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently helping out my dad who owns a very small company that primarily does work as a utility contractor. Our family has been in the industry since the 80&#x27;s/90&#x27;s and because of an abundance of paper files and bad practices it is impossible to find anything you are looking for and slows down daily operations in the office. My dad would like to transition to a completely digital system with my help. After some research I have decided on a paperless filing system using a DMS such as Paperless-ngx or Papermerge self hosted with backups to a cloud based solution. We would only need to access the documents on location but being able to outside wouldn&#x27;t hurt unless that adds complications. Documents would be everything from invoices, bills, tax records, bank statements, time cards, etc. Essentially anything that doesn&#x27;t need to be kept in its paper form we would like to convert over.
 I need help deciding on the hardware (NUC, NAS, Old Desktop, etc.), any applications I might want to host and use alongside of the DMS, best backup options (can I just use google drive, onedrive, etc?), and anything else you can think of that might be useful to know starting out.
 If at all possible I would like to be able to run two instances of this solution for two different businesses under the same roof. Ideally the hardware would be powerful enough to allow this and maybe some room for growth. Also while on the topic of going digital there were talks of doing some sort of DocuSign for the second business and if that&#x27;s something that can be self hosted or at the very least be backed up that would be great. Price is a large consideration, but If it is worth the price in quality of life improvement/time savings I will consider it. 
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>I lease a small industrial bay that only has ADSL internet currently. Fibre buildout is happening but has been delayed 6 months.
 The building next to mine has cable, and the ISP can offer up to 2Gbit connection off this. Speaking with them, they&#x27;re saying if the owners agree, they can run a point to point connection from one building to the other. Either wirelessly or just by running a coax cable between the buildings.
 Running the wire is ideal just from a reliability standpoint I think, but I&#x27;m not sure the owners and other tenants would love this... Can&#x27;t dig up the parking lot, and tough to run a wire across the road in the winter when snow removal is happening. Buildings are only 30-40&#x27; from each other, could possibly run it from one roof to another.
 Anyway, I&#x27;m wondering if point to point wireless is the way to go, and if this is reliable enough to run servers off of. This setup would be temporary until the fibre build is complete, but it still needs to be reliable, or there&#x27;s no point.
 Was looking at something like this: https://mikrotik.com/product/wireless_wire
 Thanks for any insight!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on some projects that involve running games and other software on very old operating systems, mainly Windows 3.11-XP. I&#x27;d like to be able to host these OSes as VMs on my servers and stream the video, audio, and input to remote clients. Usually people achieve this sort of streaming using Parsec, Steam, or Geforce within the VM. But none of those run on these old OSes, and they shouldn&#x27;t have network access anyway. Another solution would be to run the old OS inside DOSbox or VMWare Workstation on Windows 10, both of which are designed for high performance local VM interaction, then stream that over Parsec. But this only works well on bare metal. Trying to run this on top of a hypervisor Proxmox [Bare metal] -&gt; Windows 10 [Qemu/KVM] -&gt; Windows 95 [VMWare Workstation] results in nested virtualization, which absolutely trashes the performance of the inner VM on my server hardware. What would be ideal is if the hypervisor could directly handle the streaming of the VMs to remote clients using H.264 instead of VNC or SPICE.
 Does anyone know of a homelab hypervisor solution that is capable of realtime streaming the contents of multiple VMs, without resorting to nested virtualization? I recall finding that VSphere or Citrix had something like this, but cost like $10,000 yearly or some garbage.

                              <span>I currently have
  
TP-link TL-SG1024DE 24-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch
 TP-link TL-SG3428 24 Port Gigabit Switch, 4 SFP Slots
 TP-link TL-SG108 8-Port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Desktop Switch
 BLADE RackSwitch G8124 24-Port 10Gb rack switch. (No links needed since it basically does as what the description says it does.)
  
I started with the TP with 4 SFP, not understanding that 10Gb was SFTP+. I added the other switch for failover/redundancy, got the desktop switch for either work isolation or home isolation (still have a plan of setting up personal NAS with NextCloud for mobile backup and entertainment deployment for both cellphone and laptops), and planned on using the 10Gb switch to connect my powervaults storage to my other servers. (A mixture of poweredges, sunfires, and a Power7 server of all things equipment.)
 However, I came across these items for a great deal:
  
4 Fortinet FortiSwitch 448D-POE, switch
 Fortinet FortiSwitch 1024D, firewall/vpn + switch
 Fortinet FortiGate 200D, firewall/vpn management node
  
and now I&#x27;m wondering what I should do with them. Replace my current switches for these, or sell them for at least twice (probably closer to 3 times) what I paid for them? I still need to buy SPF+ cards for my equipment to take advantage of 10gb BLADE I do have, let alone all the Fortinet stuff (apparently, all 10gb SPF+)
 I&#x27;m also afraid I&#x27;m not knowledgeable enough to manage these Fortinet equipment. (Currently failing at setting up pfSense through Proxmox on my Dell r320. I stupidly cannot get the internet passed through a virtual linux bridge to my containers and vm. :( )

 Anyone own an R620 or similar and tried this? Is it true that the fans speed up?
 Many thanks

                              <span>Good day all, hoping I can get some help.
 I have an Eaton 5P 1500 Battery backup, 3 batteries inside all were replaced, and the unit says its protected, but the display complains that it needs service. 
 About 2 years ago, I know a client that had one of these and I replaced the batteries and did some type of reset with the front panel. Powering it on while holding buttons OR something. I cannot for the life of me find this combination, and my google-fu has failed me dearly.
 Its up and running right now, and I downloaded the Eaton SetUPS program to update the firmware, but of course its telling me it has to be off in order to update the firmware, so I am trying to find some time to do that…
 But Im hoping someone here can maybe help me with knowing the combination I can just use to reset this and move on with life. 
 Anyone?

 I would love to see diagrams or written ideas!
 Eg:
 1 NAS - 4PB Storage on its own NAT (16Core, 64GB RAM)
 secluded network for all security devices etc.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a 5 year old drive that I just took out of service because it was failing. 16 pending sectors, 11 offline uncorrectable, 6 reallocated sectors. badblocks returned 261 bad sector read errors. It failed SMART long testing (obviously). The thing is toasted.
 I&#x27;m not going to trust this drive for anything I care about, but is it useful for things I don&#x27;t care about?
 For example...
 I could use it for security camera footage in a mirrored ZFS pool to speed up reads. Every now and then it&#x27;d fail a read, but I don&#x27;t care.
 Farm Filecoin internet money?
 Do any of you ever try to get use out of a failing drive?

                              <span>My home lab only draws about 200 watts at full load, but it&#x27;s in a place where hooking solar to it to save power during the day would be simple. I don&#x27;t really want to put in a whole home solar system at this point.
 Has anyone installed an inverter that can auto switch between solar and mains power? Something in the sub kilowatt scale? Google is failing me at the moment.

                              <span>Hey guys. I currently have a Dl380 Gen 7 and it&#x27;s quite power hungry. It has the top xeon for that server (twice) and 128gb memory. Also 6 10k rpm drives.
 I could buy the same server (or even a Dl380) gen 9.
 Under the same load, will I save power? I tried searching for it, but it&#x27;s quite hard to make that decision.
 Anybody got any insights?

                              <span>So, I work for a locally owned ISP and we used to utilize TiVo. Our contract with TiVo ran out and we are phasing them out, they are past end of life so we were going to recycle all the boxes. One of the guys in the warehouse shucked all the drives, some good, some bad, some close to bad. I&#x27;ve got around 80 drives and want to know the best way to use them. 
 I already have an unraid server set up with a 4TB parity drive, but it&#x27;s pretty much maxed out. I was thinking about buying 2 PCI SATA Cards with 10 SATA conneections each, and then using the onboard sata connectors on a motherboard (which I don&#x27;t have yet) to run the parity drive along with the cache disks, which I will likely get new 1tb SSD&#x27;s for. 
 I&#x27;m not sure how to mount 20 disks though, I was thinking of having my friend (who does 3D design for a living) design me a tower that could hold them all in place and 3D printing that, but it seems like there should be some sort of off the shelf solution. I don&#x27;t have a rack and was hoping to use / reuse some old PC cases I have already. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Tried finding the best sub for this and i figured you guys are probably one of the betters to ask. 
 Im running a gaming station, web server, torrent manager, media server etcetc all on the same computer. Everythings run in parallell, mostly to and from one large HDD and i actually sit down and use this computer for personal use as well, mostly not accessing the same HDD other than for some file transfers.
 Running W10.
 I use a program called Netlimiter to monitor and limit/throttle my network usage on a per application level, so i put a ceiling on for example my torrent client to have a maximum upload speed of 500KB/s as to not use up all available bandwidth and ruin it for everything else. (i know many programs gives control of this individually, but not all)
 Im looking for an equivalent but regarding disk I/O. Most of my media is on one large HDD. If this gets indexed, downloaded to, streamed from, unpacked to and library scanned at the same time, it quickly bogs down with 100% disk usage and makes streaming movies locally a buffering, laggy and impossible mess. Kind of defeats the purpose of local streaming.
 Many of the things causing the 100% usage can come at any time or at random, making a movie start buffering and getting stuck halfway through even if everything was fine and the disk wasnt used when the movie started.
 I dont need every process to have access to 100% of the HDDs read-speed at all times whenever the process feels like it. 5% would be enough for a reoccuring library scan and not interrupt my 90%-quota for my mediaserver for example. Netlimiter solves this fantastically in every aspect in terms of my network but i cant seem to find a good solution regarding the disks.
 Any ideas or tips on how to do this?
 TLDR: How to set hard limit on .exe to use max 1MB/s write speed to disk regardless of disks maximum write speed?

                              <span>I have a few web applications on my local home network that I would like to expose on the internet so people can access while not connected to the home network. I realize that the most secure and easiest way to do this is to spin up a VPN on the home network and forward the VPN&#x27;s port and connect to the VPN from abroad. But, I have a few technically inclined family members who would rather not deal with turning on a VPN. In fact, I do have a Wireguard instance setup on my home network that I remote into regularly in order to access servers/perform maintenance. 
 The other obvious way to do this is to just port forward the HTTP/S ports for the application that I want to expose on the internet, but I don&#x27;t know how comfortable I feel about this since there could be a vulnerability on whateve…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to repurpose my old 2009 Mac Pro 4,1 as a VMware ESXi 7.0 hypervisor. I want to add some NVMe storage which I can do with a cheap PCIe converter card + a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB NVMe . The thing is, my Radeon RX 560 2GB card is so large that it is blocking the only other free 16-lane PCIe slot (there are 2 in the machine)....but I have 2 other 4-lane PCIe slots open free and clear.
 So my options are, in order of current preference:
  
Use one of the aforementioned free 4-lane PCIe slots
 Buy a PCIe extender ribbon cable to reach out past the graphics card and have the adapter just sitting lose in the case.
 Re-install the original Nvidia Quadro graphics card (non-metal GPU and much weaker)
  
I don&#x27;t need GPU passthrough to any VMs so while 3 isn&#x27;t ideal at all, it is workable. Not sure if a powerful GPU is even really necessary for a type-1 hypervisor at all...?
 My biggest question is:
  
Will I lose throughput / bandwidth by using the 4-lane PCIe slot instead of the 16-lane one?
  
Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>all the DAC cables I&#x27;ve found are under 10m which make sense cause copper loses signal over long distance. what do people use when over 10m? have two cards both are intel dual port 10g sfp+ but they are like 20-25 meters apart at least and I don&#x27;t wish to use ethernet as it is only 1gbps
 please share your expertise!

                              <span>Hey all,
 After my last post stating issues I&#x27;ve had with NPM, I decided to try out Cloudflare tunnels. Although this is still something I may do, I want to try one more option.
 I was running Nginx Proxy Manager on Windows 11 Pro, and obviously this was not working properly.
 As such, I want to install it on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, running on one of my Raspberry Pi&#x27;s. This Pi will be dedicated to ONLY running Docker with NPM installed, and nothing else.
 The issue: I set up Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and installed Docker (Which I verified was working), and installed NPM (which stated as running). I then ran &quot;Sudo sfw 80/tcp&quot; &amp; &quot;Sudo sfw 443/tcp&quot;, as well as for UDP, and attempted to log into the control panel for NPM on my main desktop. The page did not load. I then opened port 81 as well, and it still did not load.
 I&#x27;m at the point I&#x27;m asking for help again, as Googling for hours and trying various options has not worked.
 Please help. Thank you all!

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I recently revamped my media server set up and switched from Docker Command to Docker Compose to run my docker containers. Everything is running smoothly except that my Transmission, Jackett, Sonarr, and Radarr web UI&#x27;s will not load. I find this odd considering my PLEX web UI loads just fine. I have been going through my logs to try and pinpoint exactly where the issue is, but I suppose I&#x27;m just having a hard time knowing exactly what it is I am looking for. Is there some type of tool or utility that helps with digging through these logs and narrowing down certain problems?

                              <span>Not an ad I promise - just had a flyer through the door for a (I think) new FTTH provider in my area (midlands, UK) offering symmetrical 100Mb, 500Mb and 1Gb lines to homes now. First I’ve seen in my area at least doing symmetrical speeds! 
 Litfibre.com is their site. Looks like a limited roll out in the midlands so far, not sure if they’re piggybacking on BT’s fibre infrastructure. I’d assume so but I thought that network would be supporting symmetric speeds for some time yet. Would be interested if anyone knows more!

                              <span>Home setup here. I have pfsense as my WAN firewall/router and a couple of private LANs hanging off of it, one of them is my DMZ. I&#x27;d like to setup a reverse proxy so I can access some webapps when I&#x27;m not at home. My question is where should I put the reverse proxy? I could use HAProxy which is available for pfsense or should I setup a reverse proxy on a separate host/vm in my DMZ and just port forward 80 and 443 to it? My concern here is having internet facing services running on my firewall that could be hacked. Am I thinking too much about this?

 Been going round in circles so having to resort to need help... I have Home Assistant running on a Pi with NPM. Have set up three proxy hosts pointing at other points in my network. However, only the &quot;fa&quot; one works. &quot;ha&quot; gives a 400 bad request and &quot;ph&quot; an empty response. All of the internal address/port combinations work. I&#x27;ve tried this internally and externally with same outcome. Have set the logs within HA for NPM to debug, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to give anything away - can someone point me at where else I can look please?

                              <span>I think part of the reason we get involved in this hobby is to not have our data hanging out on other people&#x27;s servers/available to the public. So, I&#x27;m wondering if this is possible.
 Is there a way to set &quot;public&quot; sub domains of my TLD to private? 
 For instance, if I set up a randomsubdomain.example.com is there a way to have that only accessbile behind a password protected TLD?
 I&#x27;m picturing, if someone were to try and access randomsubomain.example.com directly they would be send to example.com which has a Welcome message and log in screen. From there, links would be accessible to send the end user to subdomainX.example.com
 I am hoping to use my websites for job applications, and only have them accessible to recruiters/hiring managers as I dont want all my work history publically exposed etc. They&#x27;re currently accessible directly, but each page is password protected. 
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

Now I’m rocking a nice small setup with a few services, available externally through Cardy with Cloudflare tunnelling and Authelia (LDAP through Synology) - seems to work very well. I keep all my container updates with watchtower with a daily check for updates. Only me and my wife using it. My box is a Synology DS218+. The landing page is Homepage. What do you guys think?

 PiVPN easy enough, got it at home on my RPi3
 our Draytek 2862 supports OpenVPN
 Veeam PN although not sure if it up to date, says requires Ubuntu 18.04
 This https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install and this https://github.com/trailofbits/algo
 A GUI would be nice, any recommendations or suggestions?

                              <span>Just wanted to post something about Frigate NVR, a self-hosted AI-driven NVR with Home Assistant support. I recently migrated from Ring to Frigate after finally biting the bullet for eight fancy POE cameras. 
 I went from around 10 false positive notifications a day with eight Ring cameras to around maybe 2 to 3, and my cameras constantly record (what a novel idea, cameras that record constantly! Ring is a step backwards in this regard.), and I record specific events like cars, dogs, bicycles, etc. People detected go straight to my phone through Home Assistant, which is proxied through cloudflared for remote access.
 Seriously, get rid of Ring if you can. It&#x27;s a privacy nightmare.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking into Crowdsec, but there is one thing that i can&#x27;t really find anywhere. and that is more detailed info about the acquis.yml file and how to write those.
 I am using docker and from what i can find, crowdsec can read the logs from containers. The only thing i cant find, is how to write that down.
 the Docs state that you can set the source to docker. That was easy.
 but what about labels &gt; type? i can&#x27;t find anything what i am supposed to set as type for my containers. i see some examples with syslog but the example from the Docs say:
 source:  labels: type: log_type #log_level:  
 Is there any list or overview of types somewhere, cause i can&#x27;t find it. I saw a traefik example that defined type: traefik. but that is pretty much all i could find. which is somewhat limiting to understand what the type could be.
 does that mean i can simply set any type i want? Does anyone know more about this?

                              <span>Hi all, I feel kind of dumb asking this but can&#x27;t seem to find an answer anywhere. 
 I have an Ubuntu machine in my home with the local IP 10.0.0.xxx and the public IP [I&#x27;m not telling you]. I have a domain registered at example.com and pointing to the public IP, and it&#x27;s currently able to see my /var/www/html/ contents. Great! I have a little homepage set up and everything. (I can&#x27;t access the website from inside my local network, but I&#x27;m aware that&#x27;s a hairpin issue and am replacing my shitty xfinity router soon.) 
 How can I access my Docker containers through example.com? For example, while 10.0.0.xxx:5005 takes me to my dashboard, example.com:5005 doesn&#x27;t. 
 So, uh, help? Please?

                              <span>so I am trying to host a website that I made and put in /var/www/html to show it to someone and expose it to the internet by using port forwarding with this command
 ssh -R 80:localhost:80 localhost.run 
 but i get this error message when using the link that gets generated
  
A tunnel is up but I couldn&#x27;t connect to a local app, check your SSH output for clues.
  
how can I solve it? I checked the output and its
  
connect to localhost port 80: failed.
  
there is nothing that&#x27;s listening on port 80 I tried netstat and nothing was using port 80
 yes I started an apache2 server and I tried to give it permissions, but it just doesn&#x27;t work (maybe I gave it wrong permissions)

                              <span>My setup is growing and now I have some server (vps, raspberry and so on) with a bunch of services each. So let&#x27;s say one dies, it&#x27;s even hard to remember which services was running there and how that was configured! While I keep configs stored in repositories, I miss something which easily tell me on that server you have these services running configured in that way.
 So that&#x27;s my question, how are you organised? A google document? Something better?

                              <span>I have several self hosted apps and services that notify me about various things such as alerting me of errors, services going down, items of stock become available and just general notifications.
 Currently I&#x27;m just using SMTP to send emails to my personal address so I get notifications on my phone, which is fine... but my notifications are growing and I want it a bit more organization and cleaner.
 My thought was to create a private Slack and create channels to group the various notifications. Slack is wildly adapted as a notification channel so software support shouldn&#x27;t be a problem however I have some concerns about privacy and I&#x27;d rather use something I have more control over.
 I know Mattermost is an alternative to Slack but not sure how supported it is in terms of sending automated messages, notifications, other software supporting it.
 Does anyone have any suggestions, or have solutions to similar issues?

                              <span>Hi, I have a Synology NAS which I run Docker apps from.
 I am looking for a Rolodex type app where I can keep track of the various tradesmen I have doing work on my house and take notes on them (good, bad, etc).
 Does anyone know of such an app?

 Everything seems to be working ok. Before I start deploying apps I’d like to save this “state”. Kind of like a VPS snapshot. Is such a thing possible in a cluster like this? I guess it would include snapshots of all SD cards (raspian images + K3s configs).

 What you need: A computer or Rapsberry pi, maybe an android can work too.
 TLDR:
 ssh -L 192.168.0.100:8888:192.168.1.50:8096 user@tailscale -p 22 -N
 You can create a ssh tunnel to open the Tailscale connection to LAN network
 Probably this is probably relatively unsafe because you are exposing your tailscale connection on lan, so beware other people connected to your network.
  
I&#x27;ve been looking for a basic way to this for a while and found a relatively simple solution. I&#x27;m new to networking so I don&#x27;t have much knowledge. My problem is that I wanted to access a device that was in a far geographic position (A). For example, 192.168.0.60:5054, however, in location (B) with my Smart Tv, is not possible to install Tailscale. However, I have access to a …</span>

 Could you recommend a good self-hosted app to manage the collection? Preferable a dockerised app.
 I would like it to use the same folder structure if possible. 
 I kind a tried immich but it does not detect the image folder for some reason...
 thanks.

 Paid Pro account, 60ish days of recording, full access, I just want to archive what I&#x27;ve got as a onetime effort. Probably 250 videos I just dont want to click through right now, plus ongoing automation would be nice at some point.

                              <span>Ideal Situation: 2x 4TB HDD&#x27;s in Win 10 PC in RAID 1, backing up to 8TB HDD in linux NAS with the remaining 4TB in NAS as a normal NAS storage share.
 Not sure how to accomplish this or if it&#x27;s even a good way. I&#x27;d like to have the 2x 4TB in the Windows PC to store games and media and such, but in RAID 1 for better read performance and some redundancy. Don&#x27;t necessarily need the backup to the NAS, but if there is an easy way to do it I would. The NAS is an old PC with a 1Gbps ethernet to PC and entire network.
 I don&#x27;t know a good way to make a RAID 1 array to do this, as I&#x27;ve heard both good and bad for making the array in windows, in the motherboard uefi/bios or with a hardware card.
 Is there a better use of the drives?
 Would a single 4TB SSD be more reliable and a safer spot for data vs 2x HDD&#x27;s?
 Please leave suggestions below.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I had some downtime thanks to a crappy economy and started sorting through boxes sitting at the shop from customer projects. I found an OpenWRT board that wasn&#x27;t used and wondered if it would work for TrueNAS. I then wondered if I could piece together a NAS just from the unused and/or broken things in the shop (almost). I did have to buy some DDR4 for the openwrt board and the case, but the rest are odds &amp; ends from other projects. 
 Frankenstein has a 150W 12v psu, a 100W pico ATX psu (just for the control board) and two 12v to 5v DC-DC converters for the SSDs and HDDs. If it&#x27;s plugged in and the main switch is on, the SSDs have +5v power regardless of the motherboard state so firmware is free to do whatever it does offline. The second switch is for powering the two HDDs and a small fan for the HDDs. Sans HDs, it&#x27;s whisper quiet.
 The control board is an N6005 at 3.2Ghz, 32GB RAM, 11 SATA ports, one nvme and 4 2.5gbe ports.
 Power is ~21W idle for control board + SSDs, ~32W idle for everything. I only had five free SSDs sitting around, so it&#x27;s missing a few in the photo.

                              <span>I have a freenas build that I created in 2017 that I am looking to repurpose from a zfs + vm/jail server to just a vanilla zfs file server. My plan right now would be to upgrade the memory (16gb -&gt; 64gb), replace the drives with 10Tb drives (maybe), and throw into a rack case.
 Is there any reason why I&#x27;d want to upgrade the mobo/cpu? The mobo has an onboard sas controller that I am currently using for the drives. Will I run into issues adding more drives with a PCI sas expander? Will using this as plex storage (not the metadata) on another networked machine be an issue for any reason? Thanks!

                              <span>I shucked 3 8 TB WD MyBooks. They work when plugged in with USB to my desktop but when installed the system (unraid) does not boot. It gives me an A2 post code. If I remove the WD drive and only leave the SSD (not wd) the system boots.
 I assume this is a 3v pin issue. but I tried tape (would not boot), Molex adapters (would not boot), and cutting the orange wire (would not boot).
 ​
 what else can be causing the A2 boot error?

                              <span>I am currently running a dell r720 with all 8 2&quot;5in drive bay filled. I have recently procured 8x 3&quot;5in 4TB SAS drives and was hoping I could get some ideas on how to connect them to the server as I would like to use them. I am looking to explore options such as a JBOD, but i haven&#x27;t had much luck in finding affordable options that would work. I am using Truenas Scale if it helps. Thanks

                              <span>I am trying to scrape data from Instagram on Python. Obviously that requires me to login to an Instagram account. But they seem to be detecting them very fast. For example, I will create a brand new Instagram account on an IP I&#x27;ve never used before (in this case, it was at a library). I will then plug in those credentials to my script and run it.
 Once that happens, it usually comes back right away with a &#x60;challenge_required&#x60; message.
 So I go to the account, login, do the &quot;challenge&quot; (usually a code that is sent to the email affiliated with the account. The email being used is tied to an email address that has never been used on Instagram) and once I enter the code, it usually suspends me right away.
 How does it know? I&#x27;m doing all of this on a fresh IP that I&#x27;ve never used before, on an Instagram that I&#x27;ve never used before, which is tied to an email that I&#x27;ve never used.
 Is there a way around this? Is there a &quot;cleaner&quot; way I could do this without them sniffing out the account so quickly?
 What&#x27;s funny is that when I run the script using my normal, person Instagram that I&#x27;ve had for years, it normally doesn&#x27;t suspend it. It might ask me to enter a 2FA code, but that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ll then re-run it and it works. I just don&#x27;t want to keep using that because I don&#x27;t want to get my real account suspended.

                              <span>My mother is basically a disabled shut-in. To make her life a little better I like to give her media to watch. She has asked me to find some older tv shows, but because they were older they tend to not be streamable/torrnetable. I am having very hard time finding copies. Even somewhat semi-newer shows that she may enjoy like MythBusters seem to have evaporated into the digital ether. Any suggestions on where I should poke around to find them besides used/thrift stores or someplace like half price books?

 &quot;Dear student,
 WGU has used many Google Workspace for Education products (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, Docs, Forms, etc.). The use of these products has been free and unlimited until now. Google recently announced that they are introducing a fee structure for Google Workspace storage which means institutions like WGU will incur charges for using/storing these products beyond a set quota. 
 Due to Google’s policy changes, and to use student tuition responsibly, WGU is instituting a 5 GB storage limit on total storage in Google. Total storage is a combined total of Gmail, Photos, and Google Drive. This same 5 GB storage limit will be placed on Microsoft Office 365 OneDrive accounts. We will begin applying these changes on Tuesday, November 8. 
 📷If you are over 5 GB, you will receive separate communication. If you do not receive a separate communication, no further steps are required. 
 If you would like to check your Google storage usage, you may check it at: drive.google.com. 
 To check your storage, log in to OneDrive, click the Settings icon in the upper-right 📷 &gt; OneDrive Settings &gt; More Settings &gt; Storage Metrics. 
 For questions or further details on this change, please visit the following Student Handbook FAQ: File Storage. 
 Sincerely, 
 Ed Tech Communications
 Western Governors University&quot;

                              <span>Hey, hope this is the correct place to ask these questions. If not would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. 
 I use a couple external harddrives to store some videos/movies. I usully like once a week plug that drive into my computer and watch a video directly from it. Is this really bad for the long term health of the drive compared to just copying those video files onto my computer and then watching them? I&#x27;m also planning to purchase another larger extrnal harddrive since my current drives are getting older and I need to back them up. I saw some WD drives recommended here. Do those often go on sale since the holiday season is coming up? I wanted to decide if I should buy now or wait a couple months. Thanks for the help.

                              <span>So before we get started here, I just want to point out that I&#x27;m only using these SMR drives in environments where self-powered, small footprint drives, for less than the cost of 4TB SSDs are required. Once they&#x27;ve been written to, they&#x27;re only ever read from thereafter.
 Write performance is obviously the problem I&#x27;m running into. It&#x27;s particularly frustrating building multiple drives. What usually happens is that everything starts out fine, around 90 MB/s but eventually performance falls through the floor once they begin filling up. Writing files at this point gets REALLY slow.. 100 KB/s - 10 MB/s.
 I&#x27;ve seen others mention doing a DD Write of an entire drive to get around the SMRs internal micromanaging. Is it possible to create a 5TB image that I can mount and modify from a larger drive, then DD Write that image to the SMR drive when it&#x27;s ready? I need to use ext2 partition for my application if that makes a difference.

                              <span>Hi all.
 Long time lurker here, and thanks to you all, gotten some ideas on my vault build for personal archiving.
 I am here, though, to directly ask for advice before committing to buying the parts for the build.
 I do Youtube, Twitch, and do tutoring as my job, So I want to keep a record of these things, plus all the documentation of pay, income, expenses, scripts, etc. As well as restoration images of my systems and copies of my live boot images for my utility devices.
  
Which Live Boot OS/Firmware should I go with that I can run as a Read Only Live boot for security that would offer the most compatibility and give me SAN and NAS hybrid features for network data access and management?
 I am torn between using Data Disk Archive or a Tape Drive for offloading data for &quot;Deep Storage&quot; to free up space if needed; which should I go with, or should I use both?
 I am looking to go with ZFS for the system, but as a paranoid type, I want to encrypt my data in a way that will play nice with ZFS, is system agnostic, and will not play havoc with the &quot;Deep Storage&quot; I go with. So, which encryption method and/or software should I use the keep the data in the Z-Pools and storage medium secure from unauthorized access, that is brute force resistant?
  
Sorry if I&#x27;m asking a lot or if my questions may be dumb of me to ask, but I know that I know very little and mostly select info, so I want to differ to more knowledgable individuals than I so that I can get this right the first time. Again, though, thank you for your time.

                              <span>My wife had a corrupted SD card, and I feel partly responsible for the loss because I had not previously set up a household data management system. Her 256 GB laptop has been sitting at 99% full for months. I decided it was time to make a change. 
 I recently built a new office PC for myself, which left an empty tower (HAF 912, 8GB ram, z77 extreme4 mobo with 8 sata ports) sitting around. I ordered five WD red+ 4TB drives for $70/each, and a new 200 mm Noctua case fan for the front of my HAF 912 to blow over the drives. 
 I wasn&#x27;t sure whether I would be able to pull it off, but installing TrueNAS, setting up the pool, users, groups, permissions, etc. was all straightforward with the help of youtube. Useful volume is 10.9 TB, set up in Raid Z2. Performance is reasonable - around 90 MB/s over my wireless LAN bridge. For an &quot;all-in&quot; price of ~$400, I&#x27;m quite happy with the system. 
 I set up gmail alerts, weekly SMART tests, bi-monthly scrubs, and I have everything set to back up to BackBlaze B2 weekly. 
 Everything seems to be going.... too well. Is this really all that I need to do? I was considering doing some failure testing, i.e. unplugging a drive, and seeing how TrueNAS notifies me. Or unplugging two drives, and trying to manually run a BackBlaze backup to see if it will fail. 
 Big shout-out to the content creators and community for the helpful guides on pulling this off.

They both have roughly 4 tb of data on them. Should I consolidate the data to under 5.5 tb and run a raid 1. Then take my spare 5tb 3tb and 3 1tb and add them into a hdd enclosure as a jbod. If I didn&#x27;t consolidate them and I had the nas run backup to the jbod is that an option? How risky is that? Can I even attach a jbod enclosure to a nas usb?

                              <span>I received my first spam email 25 May 1995. It was a novelty at the time. I remember showing it to people in my department and they were amazed someone thought of this and then had the audacity to actually send it.
 Date: Thu, 25 May 1995 07:25:29 -0400 (EDT) Subject: Now your signature or logo can be in your computer! 
 As a long time data hoarder, I saved it, and every other piece of spam I got until 2006 when the flood became too much and I lost interest.
 So now I&#x27;m thinking there might be some spam historian out there who would be interested. I would just publish it but there is the possibility that some personal email made its way into the hoard. Suggestions?

                              <span>Sorry for the general title. I&#x27;m not sure how to refer to these SSDs: https://www.memory4less.com/intel-256gb-sata-6-0-gbps-ssd-ssdsckkf256h6 versus the square ones that a lot of Windows users use for their C drive. 
 I&#x27;ve been dealing with that drive above for hours now trying to figure out if it or my OS is faulty. It only has 950 power on hours and based on some of the smartctl data (see here) it could be screwed. I&#x27;m not sure (more used to reading the data on CrystalDiskInfo). It also doesn&#x27;t help that I got this from an auction and now I&#x27;m suspecting they reset the SMART hours somehow. 
 Is this normal for these kinds of drives to have really low hours till failure? Or is this drive just faulty? I also can&#x27;t confirm if it has been dropped recently (I have some suspicions but nobody around me has come clean yet).

                              <span>Does anyone have/know of a collection of text books for a worse case scenario of most of humanity being wiped out to restart building with a chunk of human knowledge? I want to have a collection like this and basically just wondering if it already exists, and thought if anyone would know it’d be someone in this sub.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have a vps which I use to store files on google drive via an encrypted rclone mount.
 I can view the files fine on the VPS but I can only see the encrypted version on Goodsync and it will not accept the password from my rclone.conf file. For some reason in the rclone.conf file it shows password and password 2 (I have tried both)
 1, is there a way to do this?
 2, why are there 2 passwords in the rclone.conf file?
 TIA!

                              <span>I&#x27;m tired of having to hunt down the correct warranty check URL so I&#x27;m compiling a list. I haven&#x27;t found a list so far. Here is what I have so far:
 https://support-en.wd.com/app/warrantystatusweb
 https://www.seagate.com/support/warranty-and-replacements/
 https://myapps.taec.toshiba.com/myapps/admin/jsp/webrma/addRequest1NoLogin.jsp
 http://www1.hgst.com/warranty/index_gtech_serial.do (doesn&#x27;t seem to work)
 Anyone know where to check HGST? Do they even still brand them as HGST? If not them I guess that one is no longer needed. I&#x27;ve also seen some software for such things (ex Lansweeper) but I&#x27;m looking for something simpler. I&#x27;ve only seem software meant for businesses or it is more of an asset management system, which is way overkill for what I need. I&#x27;m open to suggestions.

Which one do you guys recommend?

                              <span>I recently found an old WD My Book that stopped working a few years ago I think. I removed from the chasis and tried plugging into my computer. Shows as blank in File Explorer and it doens&#x27;t let me format it.
 Similarly, it shows up in Disk Management but nothing can be done there earlier. I&#x27;ve googled around with no luck. Sorry if this is a common question here.
 It&#x27;s a 4TB WD Green
 Edit: Nothing important on this hard disk as far as I know, so it&#x27;s ok if there&#x27;s a solution that nukes everything inside, as a last resort

                              <span>I know what you&#x27;re thinking.
 &quot;You probably deleted it by mistake.&quot;
 &quot;You probably never saved it to your cloud, but you thought you did.&quot;
 &quot;Maybe you downloaded a flagged file and Google deleted it without notifying you.&quot;
 I can assure you, I double check everything before emptying my trash to make sure nothing important is getting accidentally deleted.
 I can also assure you that I&#x27;m 100% sure I&#x27;ve uploaded these files because they were mounted using rclone recently.
 So the only possible explanation is that Google is deleting files without notifying their users, which is stated nowhere in their terms of use.
 This Mashable article states that Google will delete your files for account inactivity, but that shouldn&#x27;t apply to me because I use my gdrive almost every day.
 So what&#x27;s the possible explanation for this?
 Edit
 For anyone thinking it&#x27;s a sync issues, I don&#x27;t sync my files with the official Drive app. I upload them and that&#x27;s it. If I want to access them on my PC, I just mount gdrive with rclone, then unmount when I&#x27;m finished. I don&#x27;t continually sync my files.
 There has to be another explanation for these files disappearing.

                              <span>I am rapidly outrunning my current storage solution, and will have to build something new very soon. I am looking to build a system to serve primarily as a NAS, but also to handle some other services, so that I don&#x27;t have to keep my desktop running day and night.
 My general requirements for the system are:
 + It should be able to run the operating system of my choice
 - This eliminates most pre-built NAS solutions (Synology, Drobo, etc.)
 + It should support at least 5 drives (I want to run 5x 8TB drives in either RAIDZ1 or RAIDZ2) + It should be expandable in future
 + It should consume as little power as possible
 The solution that I have come up with is to use a mini PC connected to a hard drive enclosure. The mini PC would run the NAS software and run ZFS on the connected drives. + The mini PC: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PBK35VD + The drive enclosure: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y4F5SCK + The drives: 5x https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQX27GM
 Does this solution make sense, or have I made a mistake somewhere?

                              <span>Alright so I&#x27;m sure this topic has been discussed countless times, yet from my searching a few things still aren&#x27;t clear to me, and I&#x27;m sure this same confusion exists for others as well.
 First, let me briefly establish what I do know. According to the internet, greedy companies have got copyright laws in the weird position where backing up your physical discs is legal in concept but not in practice, because you&#x27;re not allowed to break the encryption on the blu-ray discs.
 Most people ripping blu-rays out there seem to be trying to break this encryption so they can make the blu-rays &quot;DRM free&quot; and save it as a regular file. I hate DRM as much as the next guy, but my primary purpose is to digitize my blu-rays for convenience of use and safety from natural disasters.
 So my thought is simple: Why not just avoid breaking the encryption? Is there some technical reason why you can simply copy the data on a blu-ray as-is into an ISO or something and just load that up digitally on the drive (like inserting the disc) whenever you want to watch it? Or is that not how it works? I don&#x27;t understand how an encryption technique could prevent you from simply copying the data as-is into an ISO and then just treat it like a &quot;regular&quot; blu-ray disc?
 And if you can do this, then doesn&#x27;t it partially negate the whole purpose of the encryption anyways? I mean, it isn&#x27;t like someone couldn&#x27;t just copy an ISO file just like any other regular video file.
 Can someone clear up why &quot;breaking the encryption&quot; seems to be so unavoidable?

 ​
 I have a 12TB WD elements drive thats almost full with data on. Would shucking the drive be a bad idea? I dont want to risk losing the data as this drive is my final backup (multiple drives backed up to this 12tb one).
 ​
 Thanks for any advice!

 I also have a Plex server that I share with a few family members throughout the country, and with a gigabit business line, it gets some regular streaming use. 
 I&#x27;m thinking about pulling my Plex server off my 8-bay NAS and putting it onto a dedicated 2-bay NAS, just to keep stuff separate. Are there pros/cons to this approach? If it is a good idea, what box would you recommend? (prefer to stay with Synology)

I want a shared space where my employees can store their excel sheets and pdf files before logging out for the day, but I don&#x27;t want them to be able to delete those files. That is they can only copy and paste in that shared storage space. The maximum storage that I need would be 100GB

 Given what they did to GamesPedia, might be worth archiving current versions of these sites as we don’t know what will be lost in this acquisition. I’m probably going to look into that this week as there’s a ton of stuff on here :/

I don&#x27;t want it as an internal drive anymore and am wondering if it can be put in a different generic enclosure and used as an external drive? Would it work if I removed the tape?

                              <span>So I have a Elements 4TB drive that I use to store various files like videos and game roms and it’s been acting weird recently. The transfer speeds fluctuate and sometimes stops the transfer altogether until it resumes. Now, it sometimes does a clicking noise, it doesn’t do it all the time but it’s a slight click. Windows and CrystalDiskInfo claims there is no problems with the drive and it’s all healthy but I think otherwise and I can still access the drive. What should I do?

                              <span>im trying to do a setup to protect against data corruption for some long-term storage. i don&#x27;t plan to just let the data sit for months or years without copying/accessing it to keep it active, but in the event, i just want to do the best i can to ensure that the integrity is intact. i have a 3-2-1 setup but this is for one of those backups that will be accessed the least.
 anyway, i like putting stuff in archives. dealing with tons of files its been helpful to keep stuff tidy and organized. i see that i can do recovery volumes in winrar when building my archives which from what i can gather work like par files. i wondered from anybody who has experience with this stuff if it is better to stick to a program like multipar or if this winrar feature is legit and these .rev files could help rebuild an archive in the event of corruption?
 thanks for any help on the subject

 I can&#x27;t get a copy of HPE Openstore software since I am not the original owner of the drive and the license is expired on this old drive.
 I just want to drag and drop files from HDDs to tape but cant get the LTO to show up in file explorer.
 I installed Veeam but this appears to be backup software that works on repeating schedules. I just want to drag and drop whenever. 
 What software do you recommend?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m considering doing a GPU upgrade in my server and I&#x27;m scratching my head, wondering if I should swap my Quadro P400 and P1000 for a single P5000 or 6000. I know the server I have (IBM x3650 m4 w/ redundant 900W PSUs) can handle the power requirement of the P5000, but I am unsure of the P6000. As far as I can tell, the board has 2 x 8 pin GPU power plugs, but I&#x27;m not sure if the system would have an issue with it. 
 The reason for the upgrade is because my P1000 is pretty maxed out on its available transcode streams.
 If anyone has tried this, or has another idea that I&#x27;m not thinking of, any suggestions would be great.

                              <span>HP Z440 motherboard I got on eBay is not posting. The light is white (red when something is wrong like misseated or misarranged RAM) when pressed and the fans come on on the CPU cooler, case fan (not actually the case fan but an extra I found for testing), and GPU fan. No display, and no indication of working apart from the fans and the power light. 
 Reseated RAM, CPU, and all connectors. 
 Reapplied thermal paste and checked for bent pins, etc 
 Anyone here have a z440 motherboard, not inside a z440 workstation case, that is working?

                              <span>I’m shit out of ideas at this point and just looking for some inspiration. I’ve got somewhat of a home lab setup with a few systems. I’ve got one system running TrueNAS dedicated and another running Ubuntu server that hosts SearXNG as well as a raspberry pi that runs Plex, PiHole, and Unbound. I’ve got all of this behind pfsense. I’m left with a little 1u pentium 4D(or something) server with 6gb of DDR2 ram. I want to make use of this somehow but I have no idea what to install on it. Any ideas on what I should do? I’m open to all ideas, OR if you think my setup is weird or unbalanced, I’d like some input to improve. Thanks for ideas in advance!!

                              <span>I saw a really cheap PDU with a cut power cable for sale. Doesn&#x27;t seem very difficult to replace the wire, but the PDU wasn&#x27;t tested (seller couldn&#x27;t with cut cable).
 I was wondering if cutting the wire is some kind of industry convention indicating the PDU is broken or something?
 Is replacing the cable actually difficult and I am just being naive? Has anybody done it? Anything to be careful of?
 I hope this is the right place to ask and thank you.

                              <span>Hey folks. Been trying to set up my raspberry pi cluster for a few weeks. Learned a lot, but still not there. After failing at a few tutorials that turned out to be too outdated, I’ve got the hang of setting up basics of a K3s cluster.
 I tend to run into issues with cert managers, DNS etc. I’m currently running K3s + MetalLB + Traefik + Cert Manager. I’m currently trying to install Rancher (in order to have dashboard plus easy install of Longhorn for storage), but came to a stall when I have to “Set the hostname to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer” here. I’ve read good things about Tailscale as an alternative.
 In the end I want a cluster with home media capabilities (maybe Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr etc) available at my local IP or even better my_cool_ip.dev. Next step would be adding more apps like Bitwarden at my_cool_ip.dev/vault. I have a 3 node RPi cluster that I think I can do some cool stuff with if I can figure out ingress, certs, load balancing and IPs. Any tips would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to recive a NetApp JBOD storage shelf for VMWare and need some suggestions for VM storage.
 1 - Hardware raid 10 over iSCSI
 2 - ZFS (With SSD in L2Arc) over NFS
 I can see the benefits and downsides of both but what would be best in terms of performance? Both will be being served over 10GB DAC with multipathing
 Any suggestions/improvements are very welcome

                              <span>Hi all. I currently have a Synology NAS and have enjoyed running a few apps such as Pi-Hole and BitWarden server using docker. I have been super impressed with how efficient these apps run. However, I am starting to bog down my Synology and would like to start using my Intel Mac mini for some contained apps. Its a high spec machine for being a Mac mini (i7, 16gb ram). I understand I could purchase another machine that runs solely linux, but for my current situation, I&#x27;ve got to use what I have currently.
 My issue is that I need something that is efficient but also not extraordinarily complicated. I am currently running a headless Windows 10 VM via parallels to run a Sonarr/QBit setup that has a PIA killswitch. But this is pretty inefficient and uses a bit more resource from the machine than it should for what I&#x27;m trying to accomplish. I have tried an Ubuntu VM, and the resource use is similar. I am also using the machine for Plex transcodes and it is a home machine for my family and I to use for basic schoolwork and web browsing tasks. I have read some on the Apple Hypervisor for VM&#x27;s. But most of my research comes up with M1 forums which aren&#x27;t helpful for my Intel machine. I am not opposed to using docker on the Mac, but most of what I&#x27;ve read says that it&#x27;s super inefficient and not worth using. Maybe it&#x27;s changed in recent, I&#x27;m not sure.
 Hoping someone that has some better knowledge about how container/VM apps work might be able to suggest something that would better fit my needs than what I have currently. Thanks!

                              <span>I was listening to a podcast the other day and they where talking about IPMI and the dell IDRAC. they mentioned that someone had made a docker container that would allow you to access your idrac console without installing java. Since I have a dell power edge R510 that still has IDrac 6 and dont want to install Java. I went hunting. here is the link to the docker hub page. 
 https://hub.docker.com/r/domistyle/idrac6/
 ​
 all I had to do was edit the command that is on that page with the IP of the Idrac and the username and password and i was able to get to the visual console of the Idrac 
 ​
 I wanted to post this here in case someone needed it and has not heard about this god send of a container for home labers that are running dells with Idrac 6

                              <span>Anybody have recommendations on what I should look for in terms of a pair of 10Gbe NIC&#x27;s? I wanna accelerate file transfer between my &#x27;server&#x27; (Mish mash of consumer HW running windows server) and my desktop. Would prefer RJ45 but if it&#x27;s cheaper to go SFP+ and it&#x27;s associated cables I&#x27;d be ok with that.
 Just needs support for Win10 and Server 19.

 Would the R2xx (probably R200, R210 or R220) be a good candidate for the job?
 And which DVR OS/software do you guys use or recommend??

                              <span>I don;t know if this is the place that is most appropriate to ask this in, but here we go anyway: 
 So I have a &quot;router&quot; that happens to be running pfSense with an i7 12700k CPU. I&#x27;m kind of curious, if I were to get DDOSed, would it still have the same impact as on a regular router, or would it be harder take it out of service because of the more powerful CPU?

                              <span>Hope this is ok to post, but I could use some help. 
 My home is 3 stories, and I want to set up a solid wireless network that is as hidden as possible (read: high WAF). I’ve got an Amplifi HD, but I’m not thrilled with the coverage and speed. 
 I see locations where I can run Ethernet to all three floors, and would ideally like to use PoE AP’s so that I can hide AP’s in closets without running power, but am open to non PoE options. 
 I imagine that ceiling mount throws coverage mostly down for one room, so would that not work with one AP per floor?
 I’m also seeing that some consumer mesh networks automatically adjust coverage to prevent crosstalk and am not sure if more enterprise / prosumer solutions rely on the installer to map coverage to prevent crosstalk?
 Finally, while I do have a technical background, I prefer not to tinker with tech at home (fully realize I may be asking in the wrong subreddit here, but am hoping you all may know of solutions).
 Any help and advice greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hey guys!
 Before I start - I just want to say I didn&#x27;t setup my homelab in the hopes of ever making money of it. I just recently thought it would be cool to repurpose some of my idle hardware to host some services for people, as a hobby / sidegig.
 ​
 Anyways, as the title suggests, do any of you generate revenue from your homelab? and if so, how? I wouldn&#x27;t consider my current setup highend, and the majority of it consists of 12th gen dell and 8th gen HP servers. (Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&amp;T&#x27;s stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I&#x27;m (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. 
 I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren&#x27;t officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good idea, or if there&#x27;s better solutions for a side gig.

                              <span>A bit non-standard this, help and advice appreciated.
 I was a very happy ownCloud user until I moved my data to a home server, at which point the client wouldn&#x27;t work any more; it doesn&#x27;t like network shares and won&#x27;t allow them to be configured. There are workarounds, like installing an old version of the client and then upgrading, but I don&#x27;t like workarounds, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before they stop working completely.
 So I switched to Seafile, which seemed to work, but that actually stops syncing after a while too, I assume the problem comes down to file notifications across Samba or summat.
 I&#x27;m currently looking at switching to a hybrid approach, using Syncthing to sync my files up to my VPS, with FileRun on top to handle sharing and browsing. I&#x27;d do that on both sites, so I have an interface on both sites if I need it / in case of emergency. However I&#x27;d prefer to have the server as the master if possible. So before I make the big switch, are there any other options?

 Send out my email only if an email has not been responded back to for X number of days
 Insert my availability for meetings and an easy way for the email recipient to book a time with me based on those availabilities
 All of these in a Chrome or Firefox extension that adds these features directly onto the Gmail interface
  
I know Gmail has some of these features built in but they&#x27;re either hidden away via extra clicks (instead of just showing those features outright) or they suck.

 Does such a thing exists for selfhosting?

                              <span>Hey folks 👋 I&#x27;ve just created plausible-exporter.
 It&#x27;s a simple tool to export your website&#x27;s &quot;vital&quot; metrics from Plausible Analytics to Prometheus, so you can get a quick overview on how your website is doing in Grafana.
 I&#x27;ve been running it for about two weeks now and it seems to work great! Here&#x27;s a screenshot of one of my Grafana dashboards (for riesinger.dev):

 I&#x27;m very open to suggestions and feedback, as well as contributions!
 ​
 The code is quite unorganized still, I&#x27;ll hopefully find some time to clean it up, but you know the drill: Make it work; make it right; make it fast 😉

                              <span>So the post itself is short and sweet (sour). I also welcome rants from people that have selfhosted and got shafted, and rants about how those people are wrong. All anecdotal data is welcome, but sourced data would be even better ;) 
 I am going to place my email on my own domain, I wish to host it myself, but how hard is it to use a recidential IP without the big providers makin a fuss?
 I am OK with fronting a VPS instead, but my understanding is that many (most?) VPS providers ip blocks have the same issues.

                              <span>Hello, so I got into self hosting recently by setting up a raspberry pi with an external harddrive as NAS with Open Media Vault and the hobby kinda catched me so I would like to expand a little bit by getting some small server hardware that has more capabilities than a pi. What would be your reccomendations for taking the &#x27;next step&#x27;? Is there common server hardware that is sold used on ebay often for a good price? I would like something like a low power consumption server having at least 16GB of ram and a fairly strong cpu, powerful enough to run some docker containers at the same time, ideally maybe even a game server as container. It would be perfect if it could be upgraded easily by adding some more ram and maybe even switching out the cpu to a more powerful model at some point. Regarding the price I&#x27;m ready to spend up to 300-400$ excluding harddrives, if that would be sufficient? Thanks for your recommendations.

                              <span>Good day,
 I have a particular PDF that is protected (in other words, it shows the &quot;lock&quot; icon in my PDF reader&quot;)
 Does Paperless-NGX not do OCR on such?
 After importing it with Paperless-NGX, and then going to &quot;Documents&quot;, when I open the particular document and check &quot;Content&quot; tab, it shows nothing. (even though the text should be readable by OCR)
 Thanks,
 Shawn

 Paperless-Ngx uses a volume for the DB, but I want it to use the postgres database I already made for it. I have postgres running as a container already and have a few other containers using it for their databases.
 When I tried to change the settings using portainer it still uses the volume and not the pre-existing database.
 ​
 Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to expose Nextcloud to the internet. For sensitive services I always like to have two layers of authentication/protection. 
 When I configured a Tautulli instance there was an option in the official app configuration to pass HTTP authentication credentials to my nginx proxy manager instance. 
 I think this is great because now Tautulli is behind nginx HTTP authentication and a Tautulli authentication portal after that. But the great thing is that the HTTP authentication was configured once on setup and users don&#x27;t have to deal with it again.
 I would like something similar for Nextcloud. Currently, the apps don&#x27;t expect an HTTP authentication portal before the Nextcloud instance so the client apps break. Ideally, it should be a one time setup so that the user really only authenticates with Nextcloud going forward after the initial configuration.
 I do not want to use a VPN because it is not as user friendly, it gives people access to my devices and you can only reliably run a single VPN at a time so I would not be able to use a VPN provider at the same time.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 at the moment I have few domains with emails hosted by different mail provider which I access through pop3. 
 I would like to merge all the accounts and have a single pop3 server hosted on my linux box which I will access only from my local network. I&#x27;m not interested in hosting and taking care of full fledged mail server, I would like to still rely on my email providers.
 Is there any out-of-the-box solution for this?

Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to host the media server(Jellyfin, and a ghost blog) through this setup?
  
internet is mobile broadband; A sim card is put into a USB modem or 4g modem/router.
 I found out that IPV6 could be a solution, then confirmed The network is ipv6 compatible, I found an ipv6 router, got an IPV6 WAN address, but could not access it from the internet because
  
a. The carrier might have a firewall
 b. I have zero experience in ipv6 and don&#x27;t know what I am doing
 c. Or something else I still haven&#x27;t looked at.
 Error:

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been wanting to learn rust for a while, and I had this project Idea I wanted to try. So here it is:
 https://github.com/dorianim/money-balancer
 It is a super simple web app and PWA which makes it easy to manage debts in a group of people, for example on a group trip. You just enter who paid how much, and it calculates who owes what to whom.
 It&#x27;s kind of basic right now, but maybe it&#x27;s helpful to someone :)

 Since it was brought up a few times in the comments: This project is similar to the commercial app &quot;Splitwise&quot;, but not as feature-complete (yet).

                              <span>Hey all,
 I shared this post in a few developer communities like Hacker News and it was well received. Over the past few years I&#x27;ve been working on an open source project called Micro, an API first development platform and I&#x27;m now sharing Micro Services, a catalog of reusable real world Micro services.
 Most of what&#x27;s here was built with the goal of offering a cloud service to developers but it is something that is entirely self hostable and actually an avenue I&#x27;d like to personally explore more. I&#x27;ve always taken a local first approach to development and Micro + Micro Services can be run locally. 
 A few years ago I was experimenting with running Micro on a Raspberry Pi and even offering some sort of official image. Longer term I&#x27;d like to build in a UI for querying services and a secure network. 
 Predominantly the goal of the project is to create a set of services that can be an open alternative to what exists already. Currently we offload a lot to the cloud and provide a single unified querying layer but if more could be built into each service they could truly be a self hosted alternative. 
 Would love to get some feedback on how this could become a defacto self hosted solution.

                              <span>I just set up my first home server running Debian Bullseye.
 I&#x27;d like the server to hold my movies and music, but I care much more about music functionality than bells and whistles on movies and videos.
 Most important to me would be that whatever setup I go with, it acknowledges my star ratings and date that I last played it. I also want to be able to give new star ratings when I get more music.
 The last time I had a good self-hosted music setup was when my ipod classic still worked. I occasionally synced my ipod with itunes on a Windows machine via USB.
 I tried out Jellyfin, but their android app for playing music is too buggy, and there&#x27;s no way to assign star ratings or make smart playlists.
 I&#x27;m thinking of giving Kodi a shot, and hope that maybe there&#x27;s a plug-in or something that will let me give star ratings and keep track of play counts and date last played, the way itunes used to.
 Background:
 The server is running Debian, and the Kodi docs warn of extra complications with Kodi and Debian. I&#x27;m not sure if I should worry about that or if it won&#x27;t matter because the clients aren&#x27;t on Debian.
 The clients will either be Android-based devices, or some flavor of Ubuntu.
 Questions:
  
Should I go with a different back end for the server, or use the one built into Kodi?
 Should I forget about Kodi and look at some other client/server combination?
  
I will be adding movies, photos, and home videos to the server, but satisfying my music library needs is most important.
 There are so many options and combinations that I&#x27;m just hoping to get some general direction.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am slowly getting into self hosting. I have made a TrueNAS SCALE machine that, so far, just serves as a media server. I use, and have used, Plex heavily for years, movies and shows only.
 I am getting into organizing and serving other media I use less frequently:
  
Photos, Images
 Audiobooks
 Podcasts
 Comic books
  
I&#x27;m ready to tackle the next content on my list: photos &amp; images. I frequently see two self-hosted solutions recommended here: Photoprism and Plex photos to a lesser extent. 
 I recall a couple years ago Plex ended the phone auto-upload capability, which fed into its Photo libraries. However, I see nextcloud+plex recommended as a means to sync photos from phones to plex. I like plex&#x27;s built-in abilities to serve content outside of my local network. On the other hand, should I be concerned that plex will pull the plug on the photos feature completely?
 Photoprism seems to have some extra capabilities such as feature/face recognition. The UI is unfamiliar at the moment though.
 I definitely want to use something with a native docker build in the truenas scale &quot;app&quot; libraries to keep things simple. I think I would like to, at a minimum, separate my libraries into photos and images (for things like digital art).
 Which approach would be best for a self hosting beginner with the above needs? Anything obvious I&#x27;m not considering? How big a deal is putting another &quot;egg in the basket&quot; by relying on Plex to handle another media type vs. diversifying into other applications?

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I&#x27;m new to this. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m using the right terminology or not.
 I&#x27;m looking for a self-hosted Program/Server to link up a few Windows PCs to an Active Directory-type server to sync up all the user&#x27;s so that we would only have to create a user account on the server, and the user can log in with their credentials on any of the office PCs.
 I don&#x27;t mind self-hosting on-site or remotely.

                              <span>OK, I need some ideas. I am beyond done with the increasing prices and unstable hosting services I had been using for 20 years that is based on WHM and Cpanel for reseller hosting. Customers and the non-profits I host for all agree - we need to make a move.
 Can anyone recommend a self-host alternative to Cpanel/WHM setup that I can just directly administer that is #1 Open source and #2 FREE for reseller hosting services ( again I mostly host stuff for myself and a few non-profits like library board or community health 5k run event... we get spikes in traffic then nothing then spikes again with events... I can probably host this all from home with my fiber and all my servers here - or spin up an amazon or Oracle cloud server instance...

                              <span>Hi all,
 I stumbled across grocy in this sub when looking for a solution to build a shared shopping list. While complete ERP seems overkill to me, I like the idea of automating the list. So it is installed and 60+ products in the database. 😂 However one aspect still bothers me: How do you manage one time items? E.g. a shop having a limited offer for clothing or tech? It would increase the wife acceptance factor by a lot if these items could also easiliy put on the shopping list.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi, I need to create a folder with a specific structure of subfolders and files, and share it with people using a link. They should be able to open this link on their browser and view/download only whatever is shared with them using the link.
 I was using Onedrive for this. A python script used to copy the files into the onedrive subfolder, and I had enabled share on the folder and sent the link. That was when I was using my windows PC.
 I&#x27;ve since transitioned to a VM on Digital Ocean, and to use the Onedrive APIs I need to pay for a subscription and start an Azure account which I really don&#x27;t want to do.
 Is there any free or self hosted option to achieve this?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I want to replace my 10 year old Qnap TS-212p NAS. In the past, I used to have the webGUI exposed to the internet, but because a lot of vulnerabilities were discovered, I disabled this.
 A couple of friends used the webGUI to save photo&#x27;s to my NAS and I also used it a lot for link file sharing. This was my preferred way to share files over 30MB+. I can also use different internet services, but this is r/selfhosted :D
 I preferably don&#x27;t want to expose the webGUI anymore, but I do want to share files via this NAS. I think a Synology would be the best option when I want to do this. Is there a something I&#x27;m missing as a potential option to share (and upload) files securely from the internet?
 //edit: Side-note. I&#x27;m not going to expose my home IP anymore. I have a site-to-site VPN running to a virtualized environment in a datacenter. When I&#x27;m going to expose it, I will use a reverse proxy in my datacenter environment, to access the webGUI of the NAS at my home network.

                              <span>Not sure exactly what to call this. I have a personal website hosted on apache open to the internet. I have several webcams (5-10 depending on motivation) inside of my network that I want to keep isolated within my network. The cams have both a snapshot URL, as well as a streaming URL, and I am centrally monitoring them internally with a MotionEye docker.
 I want to create a &#x27;gallery&#x27; on my apache server that acts as a proxy for those URLs, and pipes the data to the web server. I don&#x27;t want to expose the backend cams or docker at all.
 At one point I had a system set up that used ProxyPass, but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything like that anymore.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I thought I was getting the hang of it, but guess I was wrong so I need some help :)
 I have a nice media server setup at home with all the *arr apps, and a couple of other apps, all running with Docker. I would like to access one (or potentially more) of my services over VPN, by using a subdomain of my main domain, which in this case is domain.xyz.
 Let&#x27;s say I want to access my Overseerr instance from the internet. My goal is to go to overseerr.lan.domain.xyz and be redirected to my docker container which is actually 10.0.0.51:9443.
 With that comes a few questions:
  
I need to setup the A record for my sub domain, but what IP address do I use for it? Do I need a DDNS service that will give me a domain to my router&#x27;s (also the DNS at my home) IP?
 
Maybe related to the first question, do I need a local DNS server in my home?
 
What do I setup in NPM after creating the sub domain?
 
Where do SSL certs come into this and how do I utilize them in this setup?
 
 Thank you :)
 Edit:
 Forgot to mention VPN. I saw most people recommend WireGaurd and Tailscale, so I&#x27;ll just check that out as well.

                              <span>So I recently shipped a tool for stupid easy self-hosting , but it&#x27;s focused on the cloud, not on personal hardware. So I ran a poll in our community to see what people actually use to self-host.
 Here are the results:
 - In total, 810 votes were cast (about 0.4% of r/selfhosted members)
 - The most popular option is &quot;From a dedicated server/self-hosting machine at home&quot; - 616 votes 
 - Next up is &quot;With a big cloud provider (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc&quot; - 79 votes (about 10%)
 - &quot;From my own personal device (PC, laptop, Mac, etc)&quot; - 62 votes
 - &quot;With a small local/community cloud&quot; - 21 votes
 The rest had other options in mind (check out comments under the original poll)
 Takeaway: I might need to add the option to self-host on your own hardware to my product. Will work on that then. There&#x27;s already some indication of what hardware people use (Raspberry Pis, old laptops, Unraid and custom servers..), but a more detailed review calls for another poll.

                              <span>With the acquisition of iRobot to Amazon I&#x27;m seriously considering selling my J7+, which I quite like, and instead purchasing a robot with the intention of flashing it with Valetudo and running it locally. I&#x27;m considering the Dreame Z10 Pro since it&#x27;s on sale for $480 right now, but if there was a better one for me to get I&#x27;d be more than happy to hear it.
 It has to have a self-cleaning base and be fairly good at avoiding obstacles. My place is 90% laminate wood floors and a couple rugs (with a rug pad underneath). Mopping really isn&#x27;t critical.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for self hosted markdown (web-)editor to replace OneNote as a notetaking application.
 I do not need any fancy features like being able to draw or anything, but standard markdown features like being able to insert pictures and create tables would be nice. It should also be able to read/organize content hierarchically based on the folder structure the files are placed in. The editor should simple and easy to use so that my wife also can use it for here notetaking.
 The most important thing is that the I am able to open the notes in any other markdown editor and that I can later replace the editor and just point to the same folder(s). I.e. I need an editor that works on actual markdown files rather than storing the content of the files in a database.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I&#x27;m here because I have a small problem and can&#x27;t find a solution googling online.
 I have a server in my LAN, it&#x27;s configured with Ubuntu Server 20.04 and Docker, and everything runs on Docker.
 I have Traefik V2.8 as a reverse proxy.
 At the moment, my domain is linked with my house ip address, but I wanted to change that to be more relaxed in letting my friends use services like Nextcloud and Searxng or pihole around the world, so I bought a VPS (the $1 one from IONOS, with 1VCore and 512MB RAM) with the idea of creating a VPN connection and routing the HTTPS traffic to my LAN.
 Problem is, it&#x27;s not working and I don&#x27;t know why.
 If I put Traefik in network_mode: service behind the Wireguard container, I can ping the VPS Wireguard container from it, but I don&#x27;t know how to route the traffic from the VPS to Traefik and make Traefik accept it.
 I tried with NGINX on the VPS, but the proxy_pass isn&#x27;t working.
 I configured it like that:
 server { listen 80; listen 443; location / { proxy_pass http://10.13.13.2; } } 
 10.13.13.2 is the IP of the Wireguard container on my home server. 
 Also, I have to implement the same thing for a friend who can&#x27;t open ports on their modem (that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not using other stuff like the docker overlay network). 
 Another configuration could be running Traefik on the VPS, and reverse-proxying to containers through VPN to solve the problem of having to proxy stuff through NGINX to Traefik, but in this case I have absolutely no idea how to connect Traefik on the VPS to the docker network at home... 
 Thank you in advance for the help!

All the nextcloud alternatives I find seem to focus on the file sharing aspect of alternatives, so I&#x27;m curious if there are any other decent apps that could replace it.
 I tried homechart, but the requirement on a 3rd party account for a locally hosted server, along with the massively large ads asking me to subscribe, quickly made it a no-go.

                              <span>Hello,
 Could you please advice me on what are the specs that are needed to create a home media server ? I already have a NAS 720+ with arr apps and jellyfin but I am not satisfied with its transcodification capabilities (I&#x27;ve been struggling to read medias on my android TV).
 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i&#x27;m looking for something that is standalone (basically I don&#x27;t want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I&#x27;m looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can&#x27;t use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an Oracle instance running a couple of apps, with nginx Proxy Manager, proxied through Cloudflare, with Auth0 handling the auth. It all works fine, except for the firewall rules in Oracle. I have all of the Cloudflare IPs and Auth0 allowed on the firewall, but I can&#x27;t get beyond authentication unless I have a 0.0.0.0/0 rule in the firewall.
 Does anyone have tips on how to pinpoint the issue? It&#x27;s my first time dealing with this combo of services, and I thought I had everything done correctly, but obviously not!
 Thanks.

 The main hang-up is mounting a motherboard into the case. There is no back part of the case to mount anything. There isn&#x27;t even a back panel as the top and both sides are one continuous piece.
 I can&#x27;t find anything about this subject online (including the search term &quot;CD duplicator&quot; only shows &quot;How to Copy onto a CD&quot; results) and I didn&#x27;t see anything in the DH wiki. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of project?

                              <span>First off I am looking to get a drive for storing my Youtube videos as a backup in case I ever need my original or edited videos. Once the drive is filled I don&#x27;t see myself using the drive unless I needed to for some reason or another. So my 2 questions are.
  
Would a HDD or a SDD be better for me with. Will there be any data loss if im not using them for long period of time after filling it up as I only need it as a back up storage.
 When I look at HDD I see the External drives like the Western Digital Easystore or Mybook. What would be the difference in one of those type of externals and just getting a hard drive and putting it into an enclosure?

                              <span>Hey all
 I have small server running raid 10 (4-6tb drives) . the other day I lost everything in a particular drive until i used the windows error checking tool and it all showed back up.
 well now the whole thing says i need to format the drive, which is the whole raid server.
 individually when i take the drives out they all show up except for drive 1 which says it needs to format.
 ​
 is it just a bad drive? ive had bad drives before and they of course repopulate when a new one is inserted, will this work?

                              <span>One of the disk in my 5 year old 6x raidz2 array died and I bought a replacement for it, I went with a WD Red 6TB just because it is the same model as the other disks, I was not aware of the differences in SMR vs CMR, and of course it was not mentioned in the listing. Last night I added the new disk and let it resilver overnight, but it did bother me that in smartctl it has (SMR) in the name.
 So today after searching about it I found all this info about how bad the SMR disks are for raid and especially bad for raidz, this one article says it took them 9 days to resilver a 4TB Red, and i&#x27;m here confused because it only took 8hrs for my raidz2 (56% full) zpool, so I have to ask if they are that bad? should I avoid them if possible in the future?

                              <span>Since I know a decent amount of you probably use more than 6 sata ports, and have every single HDD slot filled (including the 5 1/4), I&#x27;ve been looking at the new AM5 platform and based on seeing what was removed, made me wonder if any of you would upgrade to it.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that with AM5, that if you want 8x sata ports, you need to buy 670e. However most of those only come with 2 x16 PCI 5 slots. Since I know some of you use some sort of Sata controller (probably either in a x1 or the x16 (4x) slot), how many would still upgrade, if you had to use the controller in the 2nd x16 slot (thus both now run at 8/8).

                              <span>So I was looking at getting a new HDD for my home server, and was looking at an 8tb drive but then saw that the Toshiba MG09 18TB (MG09ACA18TE) was available for a little more so I was thinking with that little of a price difference then I’ll take the 18TB drive, but my server (An old Dell Optiplex 7010 DT) can’t simply find it, maybe 1 out of 100 tries I can see it in my bios, so I went to a friend of mine and his machine just saw it, we had some issues formatting but the bios could always see it and we got it formatted…
 But my pc would simply not see it…
 Can it be some kind of issues with the drive (3.3V) or is it just my old machine which is causing the issues?

 Address is https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/
 I just ran into 429 so looking into how to get around that now.
 Is someone who is more experienced with backing up a site was able to give it a go as well?
 EDIT: Seems like the wayback machine has some of the forums backed up but ever post I tried to view was missing.

                              <span>I have a lot of smaller hard drives that take up all of the drive bays in my PC. I&#x27;m looking to get rid of them and just buy two 14+ tb hdds and move everything to them.
 I was looking up the Seagate Exos X16 14TB but many people commented its quite loud and they wouldn&#x27;t put it in their main PC. Sadly, that&#x27;s exactly what I want to do. 😅
 Are there any 14+ tb hdds that are also quiet but 7200prm? Hell, I may just go big and get 3. Preferably close to that ~$14/tb range.

                              <span>So I know I&#x27;m going to get ripped apart for this but here goes. Among other forms of data hoarding, I&#x27;m also a tab hoarder. I had like 600 tabs open on my Chrome on my android phone. 2+ years of &quot;oh, this looks interesting/useful. I&#x27;ll look at this later..&quot;
 Some of it was probably just crap, but I had lots of important stuff open too. Stupid I know, should have used bookmarks and sync to backup or something. It was on my to-do list to get the backup sorted, but I didn&#x27;t get around to it. Procrastination. I accidentally clicked &quot;clear all data&quot; and it&#x27;s all gone. I&#x27;ve felt shitty all weekend, not even joking. How pathetic is that, I know. Can&#x27;t stop thinking about the stuff I&#x27;ve lost (or more specifically, the stuff I don&#x27;t know that I lost, which is 10x worse). Nobody else understands.. Know it sounds melodramatic and ridiculous but that&#x27;s how I feel. Think this is probably one of the only places on the internet who understands the feeling, everyone I&#x27;ve mentioned it to is just like &quot;so what?&quot;

                              <span>I know this is a long shot but is there any way to recover a lost post that isn’t on waybackmachine/archive.org or google cache, that would be helped by the fact that it disappeared sometime in the last week and was last accessed on my computer only last week? (I found some reference to the idea of an individual computer’s cache somewhere but couldn’t find any more info on that).

 Whilst the ideal would be some way of sharing it to his tv, I know this is impossible without another device which adds a whole new UI problem. That leaves me with pc to pc, which I&#x27;m thinking something like google drive might be the simplest, but even that will be a learning curve.

 Any tips on what the cheapest is? (nno redunndancy required as it is just an offsite backup.).
 Any tips for dealing with uploading that much data quickly?

                              <span>Has anyone self hosted here before? I ask in here as my site stevenwhiting.com was supposed to be a place for myself for my notes. As an IT engineer I just wanted a place on the web that I could see my notes wherever I was. Unfortunately, after 12 years of keeping it up, I can&#x27;t afford it anymore. It will cost £95.99 again this year, I can&#x27;t fault Krystal Hosting as their customer support has always been really good. I just can&#x27;t justify paying that this year.
 I&#x27;m going to speak to them to see if I can possibly get a cheaper package but I was thinking of just hosting it myself on and off. So it won&#x27;t be on all the time. I have a spare Raspberry Pi that I could stick it on. Just don&#x27;t know how easy it is to host your own wordpress site.

                              <span>I’m a data hoarder myself with million of links and tabs saved in my Onetab account. I also have heaps of downloaded ebooks and videos that probably will last me a few lifetimes
 I was wondering what jobs can a Data hoarder like me go for and how to start?

                              <span>I have always wondered if the closer you are to filling an HDD if it affects overall performance? I know if it is full it will start acting weird but is there a specific percentage? Like if you have an 8TB HDD you should have at least 500GB in reserve or something available to keep up performance? I hope this makes sense.

                              <span>I come to this sub occasionally to see what cool projects people are working on and to enjoy the blinking lights of server towers. I&#x27;d love to have a piece of kit like this in my basement but I don&#x27;t really have a need for massive computing power or networking. Just wifi and an amazon dongle here. 
 What is your use or need for a server at home?
 ​
 p.s. I guess I can use one to store hard drives for YouTube footage backup? But then again I use an old LTO5 drive for that.

                              <span>Hey,
 Looking to build a DIY nas to replace aging QNAP.
 Will be used as file server and backup. However, I also want to be able to spin up docker containers for OS, CI/CD self hosted agents, VS Code server etc.
 I’m a little confused and unsure if possible/how I can have TrueNAS setup for file serving, and have these home lab virtualisation flexibility, how I might split the storage pool to accommodate files and VMs, whether, with TrueNAS as OS I will still have access to the CLI to do docker builds etc?
 I feel I’m missing some basic understanding on how such requirements might be set up on a home lab.
 Grateful for any clarity!

                              <span>As the title says, im about to get into this rabbit hole...
 A bit of background -- Like 20 years ago i was an Integration Engineer for a Telco vendor and specialized in management systems. I was quite fluent on HP UX and whatever applications we used to use back in the day. Life happened and I went to the Dark Side and became a manager
 Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I&#x27;m kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)
 I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal
 I don&#x27;t have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus
 Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant
 Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started. Does this sounds reasonable?
 Any other help of pointers you guys can give me are much appreciated

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve long been using these mini PCs as my home router. The current gen on Amazon for reference ..
 https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-ZBOX-N3160-DDR3L-1600-SATAIII/dp/B01N95X5KH/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?keywords&#x3D;zotac%2Bmini%2Bpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1664674168&amp;qu&#x3D;eyJxc2MiOiI1LjEyIiwicXNhIjoiNS4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjMuMzQifQ%3D%3D&amp;s&#x3D;electronics&amp;sprefix&#x3D;zotac%2Bmini%2Celectronics%2C158&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;ufe&#x3D;app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&amp;th&#x3D;1
 I just install linux on one of these, configure routing / firewall / dhcp / etc. It hits the sweet spot for me, small, silent, dual ethernet ports. I don&#x27;t care about the wifi and keep it disabled.
 Now I have occasion to run IEEE 1588 / PTP on my network. I&#x27;d like to host the grandmaster clock on my router. However, the box I have (slightly older version of the link above) does not support hardware timestamping on the ethernet NIC.
 ​
 0 % ethtool -T enp2s0 # the other interface shows the same capabilities Time stamping parameters for enp2s0: Capabilities: software-transmit software-receive software-system-clock PTP Hardware Clock: none Hardware Transmit Timestamp Modes: none Hardware Receive Filter Modes: none 
 ​
 I&#x27;m looking at new hardware, and I&#x27;d like to get something very similar to what I already have, but with a newer ethernet chipset / support for 1588 HW timestamping. I&#x27;ve had a really difficult time determining, for the candidate hardware, whether the onboard NIC will have this capability.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Hey people.
 I&#x27;m looking to build a more proper rack based homelab for VM&#x27;s, NAS and networking but my office is upstairs and basically full and my NBN node is actually in my garage so it seems my only option is to set the rack up in my garage.
 Is there anyone here from Australia and more specifically in a more humid climate like QLD who has their lab in their garage? and if so is there anything extra that should be done? My garage is extremely clean and only other purpose is for my gym setup and a freezer so it should be a nice environment for it.

                              <span>Hi, I have an almost unused
  
HP Z220 Intel Xeon E-1240 V2 CMT
 32GB RAM
 256GB SSD for OS
 6TB x 3 for NAS
 4TB x 2 for backups.
  
Is this good for a Homelab virtual server + NAS.
 I am not into gaming or video editing. I will probably run Emby or Plex for media and will run 2 - 3 Windows VMs for family members and two Linux VMs as my dev server.
 I am planning to install Proxmox on it. It will be running a couple of VMs ( windows 10 pro + Linux Mint) and a TrueNAS instance severing as NAS. I am wondering if this config will be able to handle this workload.
 I am pretty new to all this. So bear with me if I have a few things backwards.

                              <span>Hello,
 Could you please advice me on what are the specs that are needed to create a home media server ? I already have a NAS 720+ with arr apps and jellyfin but I am not satisfied with its transcodification capabilities (I&#x27;ve been struggling to read medias on my android TV).
 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i&#x27;m looking for something that is standalone (basically I don&#x27;t want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I&#x27;m looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can&#x27;t use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

                              <span>Just installed Deskpool and the entire thing is very very sketchy. First of all, all of the posts I can find about it are from the creator of it, and everything is in Chinese. The user interface seems very outdated(think ESXI but 10x worse and slower). And instead of asking for an API Key for hypervisor integration, it asks for the ROOT password.
 ​
 Also even though they accept commercial payments, they don&#x27;t have any copyright (at least that I can find) or a entry in the Better Business Bureau database. There website https://www.deskpool.com/ is also sketchy (at least it feels like it with everything else) with basically 0 documentation to speak of. 
 Has anyone actually deployed this before? If so has anything been weird?

                              <span>I’m just wondering what domains/URLs you are all using for self-hosted services. Are you using subdomains? Do you have a domain with your personal name as main domain, or do you have a special domain for your services?
 I have a mylastname.tld domain and am planning to host multiple services via docker (publicly but only for personal use) and make them available via subdomains via Caddy reverse proxy. I am pondering whether to use my aforementioned domain like for example git.mylastname.tld or to use other formats like git.home.mylastname.tld or another main domain (instead of mylastname) altogether.
 This is not about the technical realisations, these are clear to me, just curiosity about how others organise and use their domains or if there is something like a best practice.

                              <span>Hi,
 I would like to do something similar to this, but using nomad.
 If I understand correctly the nomad documentation I have to setup a CNI network for this. This is my config right now:
 json { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;mynet&quot;, &quot;cniVersion&quot;: &quot;0.4.0&quot;, &quot;plugins&quot;: [ { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;bridge&quot;, &quot;isDefaultGateway&quot;: true, &quot;ipMasq&quot;: true, &quot;ipam&quot;: { &quot;type&quot;: &quot;host-local&quot;, &quot;ranges&quot;: [ [ { &quot;subnet&quot;: &quot;172.22.0.0/16&quot; } ] ] } } ] } 
 Nomad parses the config, gives no error message. So far so good. Now here is my job file for pihole:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;hcl job &quot;pihole&quot; { datacenters &#x3D; [&quot;dc1&quot;]
 group &quot;pihole&quot; {
 network { mode &#x3D; &quot;cni/mynet&quot; port &quot;http&quot; { static &#x3D; 80 to &#x3D; 80 } port &quot;DNS&quot; { static &#x3D; 53 to &#x3D; 53 } } task &quot;pihole&quot; { driver &#x3D; &quot;docker&quot; env { TZ &#x3D; &quot;Europe/Budapest&quot; VIRTUAL_HOST &#x3D; &quot;pi.hole&quot; PROXY_LOCATION &#x3D; &quot;pi.hole&quot; FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 &#x3D; &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; WEBPASSWORD &#x3D; &quot;piholepass&quot; } config { image &#x3D; &quot;pihole/pihole:latest&quot; ports &#x3D; [&quot;http&quot;, &quot;DNS&quot;] ipv4_address &#x3D; &quot;172.22.0.2&quot; volumes &#x3D; [ &quot;/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole&quot;, &quot;/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d&quot;, ] } } 
 } }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 If I use network.mode &#x3D; &quot;bridge&quot; and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine. However this version starts up normally, but it can not reach the internet:
  [✗] DNS resolution is currently unavailable 
 I have checked that CNI takes care of routing, the proper nat tables show up with ifconfig.
 Any idea how should I fix this? Anything else to check?

                              <span>I have an old gaming rig, some new hard drives, a list of things I&#x27;d like a personal home server for, and a few steps missing in terms of actually getting everything up and running.
 First is the OS, I&#x27;m thinking Debian since I&#x27;m more familiar with Debian based stuff than others, but if there&#x27;s better options I&#x27;m up to learn.
 The next stumbling bock is that I&#x27;m vaguely aware of containerization being good for things like the game servers and probably an Element instance I want to have but I have no idea where to even begin with that. Is it a &quot;definitely do this&quot;, &quot;good practice but not strictly necessary&quot;, or &quot;you&#x27;re probably not gonna need it&quot; sort of thing?
 The last is backups and storage. I&#x27;ve never actually done a proper network share before with Linux, but I&#x27;d like to. I&#x27;ve been using an external drive and Timeshift for backups, but it looks like it&#x27;s more geared towards non-network backups. Is that a problem that should sort itself out once I get a proper share set up or should I probably be using something else?
 Those are my questions. I welcome all help and suggestions you got for me.

                              <span>Hey! Just published a pretty big list of tools, categorized and organized into sections (Engineering, Marketing, Operations, and so on). Took quite a lot of time, and I incorporated tools from all sources I could find. 
 The stats are as follows:
 - 364 tools in total, out of these
 - 229 are open-source
 - 19 are fair-code (licenses that e.g. disallow commercial use, like Elastic license) 
 - 45 are proprietary with easy export options (mostly for reference)
 It&#x27;s also easy to submit new tools there if anything&#x27;s missing. Hope these serve as inspiration, there are also links to websites and I plan to add direct links to docs so you can jump to self-host any of those quickly. Hope you like it!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve tidied up a project of mine enough to share. I give you, BeatLog! It&#x27;s available as a docker image and intended to be a local network companion to your server.
 ​
 Parse NGINX -- I use SWAG-- reverse proxy logs (access, error) and fail2ban logs, save the data into a PostgreSQL database, and generate neat reports, maps, and more. Note that adding locations to parsed IP addresses requires the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 BeatLog!
 Some features I&#x27;m proud of and use:
  
Rapidly parses log lines into useful data
 Characterize IP addresses as &quot;Home&quot; or &quot;Outside&quot;, based on server&#x27;s current public IP address.
 Assess outside visitors by location, and other useful metrics
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren&#x27;t found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names
 Make fun maps
  
​
 Check it out if it appeals to you, and please submit any bugs you find or feedback you consider. As linked in the bullets above, I&#x27;ve tried to put some effort into the documentation to get a user started. Thanks!

                              <span>I need some help and have a lot of questions. I am unsure how to keep home network access fast, remote access secure and privacy for my traffic. 
 Currently running OMV + Linux based machine with docker (plex, arrs, vpn etc) but I want to move to a Proxmox host with VMs + containers. I acquired a Dell 730 for a killer price and will be moving to that in about 2 weeks. 
 I want to allow access to plex and something for plex requests to 3 users remotely. These 3 users will only ever access those two plex focused services. 
 I also want to expose about 10-15 services including the two plex ones above to 3 different users. Does this mean I need 2 different dashboards/sites for each user group?
 I thought maybe a reverse proxy (traefik) with authentication? (Authelia) put services behind wireguard to link to my VPN? Do I need something to handle certificates? Lets encrypt ? Cloud flare tunnels? So confused. 
 What&#x27;s the least complex way to do this and what order do I go in (maybe Traefik then wireguard then ???) Trying to figure out the boot/compose order so everything is ready before the next service starts up. Right 
 I have a domain name that I bought but how to use it Suggestions, links, guides anything to help put these pieces together is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello company,
 In my quest to replace the seductive tools from GAFAMs in my (and my relatives) mobile/computer ecosystem with self-hosted ones, I want to replace whatsapp. After some research, matrix-synapse coupled with the element client, seems to be a good option.
 If any of you have succeeded in setting up something similar to what I&#x27;m trying to do, have tips, suggestions, leads or answers, then I&#x27;m interested :)
 Some personal constraints :
  
No domain name bought for the moment, I don&#x27;t want to depend on any external service, we&#x27;ll see if this choice will last in time (I also plan to host my DNS server)
 Hosting on a home server on a modest ADSL connection, the upload speed is therefore very low, but I intend to make with it at least for the whole test phase and then eventually mov…</span>

 Jellyfin, Sonarr, Bazarr, Radarr, qbittorrent, Adguard Home, Watchtower, Syncthing, Portainer
  
Only 2 things I use from Synology Package Manager is SMB Share and Tailscale for remote access.
 And I also require a Windows VM where I&#x27;ll need a USB passthrough which Trunas scale and core didnt offer, which made me switch to Xpenology.
  
Downside I ran into is Jellyfin Transcoding requires Nvidia driver to be 470 or above, Xpenology only offers 440.44 with no way to upgrade.
 So I&#x27;m looking for a Free OS or Hypervisor, that allows me to run every thing i have now in Docker containers and also offers me HW transcending in Jellyfin using Nvidia, plus allows me USB passthrough in VM and remote access with Tailscale.
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi all. 
 Hope this is the right spot to ask....
 So, today some weird things started happening on my network. All the apps that rely on &quot;outside access&quot; (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan  router (pppoe)  lan  nginx reverse proxy  apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns &quot;autobots&quot;.
 In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started &quot;falling off&quot; from my services. My phone wouldn&#x27;t sync with NextCloud, people&#x27;s locations didn&#x27;t update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if &quot;my&quot; domains were &quot;listed&quot; on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren&#x27;t propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).
 I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.
 Does anyone know what&#x27;s going on? Anyone experiencing similar things?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I currently run Nextcloudpi(not docker image) in Debian laptop with Photoview and Photoprism in Docker complementing the images and videos from Nextcloudpi. I also have motioneye for 3 of my cameras for continuous feed (not recording)
 ​
 Now planning to move the setup to a new machine with i5-9300U and Nvidia 1660Ti (6GB) machine with 16GB(can upgrade to 32GB as well) ram. I want to run the services that can also take advantage of the graphic card. So here are my questions
  
Is windows going to be better in terms of docker/services taking advantage of graphics? (I know docker in windows is VM whereas docker in linux run natively)
 I do see instructions to make docker use Nvidia graphics using NVIDIA container toolkit. Do they also apply to docker desktop? 
 Asking the above questions because it seems to be easy to manage docker containers through docker desktop app instead of old method
 
 Please suggest the services for photo/videos &amp; surveillance that can use my hardware optimally (both CPU and GPU) to render the content. 
 So far I have only seen Jellyfin that I can make it use the graphic card for video rendering and it worked great.
 
 Also suggest if there is any service other than Nextcloud(pi) that is better and can complement Jellyfin/Photoprism 
 Seafile is not for me because of it&#x27;s block based storage which makes it hard to backup my data to a cloud
 
  
Thanks for any inputs and suggestions

 With self-hosted services, is it unethical to replace the branding and designs with your own?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am running a single Proxmox server with a few LXCs and VMs. 
 On this, I have a single Ubuntu VM that acts as my main virtualized server for all my docker services. I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. 
 The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.
 This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I&#x27;d like to play with kubernetes a bit. I&#x27;ve already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.
 However, I still don&#x27;t understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I&#x27;d assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.
 If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.
 Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server? Is the increased complexity worth it anyhow?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have it on Cloudflare.
 Buy something like blah404.xyz, it&#x27;s about $40 for 10 years.
 Then, setup subdomains/zones like: *.machine_name.wan.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.local0.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.vpn0.blah404.xyz, etc.
 And, of course, these can all be compatible with Caddy and other pieces of software for automated SSL certificate management from LetsEncrypt.
 And, yes, you can set these to Private IPs as well. It&#x27;s low-risk to do that, AFAICT.
 And, I have a bash script that works on my linux server and my macbook that works with arrays and other goodies to help me quickly set the IPs (cron jobs too) by using Cloudflare&#x27;s API.
 Now, I no longer need to mess with my AdGuardHome instance because, via standard DoH or DoT, I can access all the DNS records I&#x27;d need for public or private use.

Ideally, this would be packed in a Docker container and would provide proxying and/or routing. Can you provide me with some recommendations? Thank you!

                              <span>I run Meshcommander and it works great.. i have full access and remote desktop to my 3 VPRO systems..
 Figured i&#x27;d give meshcentral a go and for some reason i can only hit 2 of the 3 systems.. and the 2 seem to alternate depending on which system i&#x27;ve rebooted most recently.. I can&#x27;t make head nor tail of it..
 Is there any alternative to meshcentral for a webui to manage multiple vpro systems with remote desktop capabilities?
 Edit : i&#x27;ve figured out what&#x27;s going on.. i&#x27;m hosting Meshcentral on a vps and have 3 tailscale failover subnet routers.. one on each vpro server as an LXC.. it all depends on which subnet router is being used.. whichever it is is the one i cannot access from meshcentral... i&#x27;ll bring it in house and away from the subnet routers and that should solve my issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently accessing my self hosted applications through a VPN (ZeroTier). The problem with this approach is that each user that wants to use a service, or even myself, needs to join the ZT network, and have it enabled. Even if other people were not to use the network, it&#x27;s still bothersome to me, since the ZT network on my phone consumes a lot of battery, and all the traffic is going through it which I&#x27;m not too fond of.
 So the option is obviously opening ports. However this has security risks which I don&#x27;t want to have, and I began looking for alternatives. It seems that a tunnel with Cloudflare would be a good option, but there&#x27;s some thing I want to understand about it.
 Cloudflare seems to simplify security, since they automatically detect and block suspicious connections, and they offer many tools to manually restrict connections with various arbitrary filters. However, let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s some services I self host that I want to allow everyone to access, and there&#x27;s some others that I want to restrict to selected users, how risky is this? Isn&#x27;t a chain as strong as its weakest link?
 If I have an application open to the public, couldn&#x27;t a vulnerability in that application compromise my entire network? Assume each application is running on its own docker container of course.
 I use a reverse proxy with nginx to access each service with a subdomain. Does Cloudflare limit my ability to do this in any way? I saw that I may need to add applications one by one, can I use a wildcard redirect or something?
 And also, does Cloudflare have data limits and speed limits? Since all my traffic would be going through them via the tunnel... I guess this is par for the course. It would really suck if that&#x27;s the case, but I guess deep down I already know the answer.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have gotten very interested in citrix storefront (web ui) and citrix desktop (Essentially bringing a vm to another device). Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM&#x27;s or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. 
 Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can&#x27;t be the whole solution because it can&#x27;t autocreate/allocate VM&#x27;s for users and doesn&#x27;t shutdown when not not in use. Doesn&#x27;t help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can&#x27;t auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically
 I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly. But sometimes I wish I could just spin up a VM with an easier user interface or create a new user with a VM already allocated that could be connected to easily.

                              <span>Some people want to use a computer in a room other than the PC is in. That&#x27;s where these various keywords come in: Remote desktop / KVM over IP / 100ft+ HDMI cable.
 Overall: this is a niche market. higher lag uses are allegedly mostly covered by RDP. I am going to put my gaming PC at my TV and any office work will hopefully be within the cheaper, laggier options like RDP.
 Here&#x27;s a summary of some things you can search for.
 Remote desktop / RDP
  
requires windows pro or similar
 presumably laggier than a direct wire solution
  
Non RDP software solutions
  
teamviewer
 anydesk ($120/year) https://anydesk.com/en/order
 p2p https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/p2p
 supremo https://www.supremocontrol.com/pricing/
 synergy
 barrier https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Pi-kvm
  
1080p50 (not a typo) x1 monitor
 $275 assembled + needed parts (power supply)
  
bliKVM
  
uses pikvm
 lives in pcie?
 https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Thunderbolt docks + Corning optical thunderbolt
  
$550ish for cable. additional dock cost
 hand assembled in clean rooms
  
Level1techs KVM
  
not directly relevant but good KVMs are hard to come by
 can&#x27;t vouch for it but has the right buzzwords
 https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-usbc-model
 he mentions around the 5m mark in the video that you can use a pi-kvm to chain a non-IP KVM over IP. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;LwsznhIBPMc
  
Keywords to look for:
  
optical
 fiber
 KVM
 KVM over IP
 KVM over copper
 HDMI over ethernet
 thinclient
 hdBaseT
 displayport (seems to support more than HDMI)
 note the differences between displayport 1.2, 1.4 etc. and the daisy chain possibilities in there.

                              <span>I currently have Windstream and they are using VDSL2 modems. It’s one of those router/WiFi/modem in a box type of devices.
 I want a VDSL2 modem that’s just…a modem, nothing else. It seems impossible to five though. No luck on Amazon.
 Any brand/models you guys would recommend that would just be a plan old VDSL2 modem and nothing else?

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I got a DL360 Gen9 recently and it came with 32GB of ram 4GB x 8 sticks, I plan to install a second cpu in the socket and buy another 32gb of ram 16GB x 2 sticks.
 What would be a the optimal way of slotting them. I was thinking of leaving the current setup on socket 1 where its all the black and white slots, slotted. and placing the 2 16gb sticks in L + j slot in the second cpu.

                              <span>So here’s the plan… 1. modify my old Honda generator for pushbutton electric start 2. Setup my UPS to trigger a relay to start the genny 3. Put it outside the window of my homelab along with a big reserve tank for gas (this takes care of noise and exhaust) and run a power cord into the lab 4. Somehow (maybe some sort of relay system) when the genny kicks on, it switches the PDU over from the UPS supply to the genny supply.
 Voila! Hours and hours and hours of uninterruptible power so my Minecraft server will never go down!
 Overkill?

                              <span>I want to create a high availability cluster in my homelab and (it may not be 100% necessary but) I want to use 5 of the same exact machine. I don’t have 5 of any version of Raspberry Pi and it would be cost prohibitive to do so. And since demand is high for Pi’s…
 The thin clients I’m looking at have AMD quad core processors (2.4 GHz) and come with 8GB RAM and 64GB SSDs. Power consumption is typically around 15W and being x86, I’ll never have to worry about finding compatible Docker images. Best of all, they’re going for around $50 each, so my existing Pi collection - even selling them for less than the crazy top-dollar prices currently found on eBay - should pay for 5 thin clients. (That’s important because I’m currently unemployed and can’t add any $ to make this happen.)
 Does this seem like a good idea to you? If not, why not?
 Thanks for your time and consideration!

                              <span>To clarify what I mean in the title: I need help deciding on the best method to use for remoting into my homelab/network from the outside.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve currently got three options I&#x27;m deciding between, and I&#x27;m not sure which one would be the best long-term. 
 ​
 Option 1: I have a router that has VPN capability built in. I can set up the VPN on the route, download the OVPN client, put it on whatever device I will need to have access the home network, badabing badaboom.
 Option 2: Bastion host. I have a few spare devices I could turn into a bastion. Got a Lenovo T470 that isn&#x27;t currently doing much, got a RaspberryPi 4 that isn&#x27;t doing much, I could also spin up a VM on proxmox to act as a bastion.
 Option 3: Jump server. This one honestly seems a bit overkill and superfluous. The idea of hitting a machine then having to reauthenticate to another machine on my home network just sounds like a chore (I&#x27;ve also heard some people argue that in the modern cloud a bastion host is a type of jump server, I disagree, but I digress).

 So what I&#x27;m looking for is just to get some ideas about what others have done for their home network and how well it&#x27;s been working from a security standpoint and a reliability standpoint.
 Thanks in advance!

 Curious how I&#x27;m supposed to use it / what I&#x27;m supposed to do with it.
 Edit- can someone ELI5 what the free tier is? Like … what do I get? Is it just a VM? I’m totally green when it comes to this.

                              <span>Hey reddit :D i have questions..
 fiber scared me as of now but as the days go on, my lab and date requirements expand, and the distances I need that data to travel fiber is becoming the only option. So fiber it is but im kind of walking into it blind so here I am turning to the smart people of reddit.
 ​
  
I have unifi gear, does ubiquiti have their own transceivers? or do they just use the same ones? format? standard? as someone else like cisco?
  
​
  
 multimode LC is the best for what i want right? (long 10g run through conduit)
  
​
  
 do i need to find the distance and buy the correct length? and if so where? fs.com? or do i want to learn how to terminate fiber.. which from what ive seen isnt rly something you just.. do.
  
​
  
how far under the rated distance can I be before i risk burning out the receiver?.
  
​
 i think thats all, thank you all in advance.

                              <span>So, was going to add drives and just found that one of my raid drives has an error, fuck me, tried to identify the drive, and then remembered an issue I had noticed but didn&#x27;t think much of...
 I have two P822 controllers in my dl380 g6, to replace the p822 on the original backplanes, and they aren&#x27;t able to turn on the blue led to identify the drive in question. 
 Is there some sort of fix for this? It seems odd that they don&#x27;t work since it&#x27;s all HP oem hardware. 
 I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s just a seating issue or something from cleaning a while back, two drives read &quot;5TB SATA 512e HDD&quot; but the bad one reads &quot;5TB SATA HDD&quot;, not too sure why as I haven&#x27;t dug in too far yet as I&#x27;m occupied, but wanted to get this posted.

                              <span>I am learning a new language and i am trying to download the spoken word .wav files that are on this page: https://www.learnpunjabi.org/statistics.html
 The words can be heard by clicking on the small speaker icon. But there doesnt seem to be an easy way to download the .wavs themselves. The only way i have found so far is to right click &gt; inspect element. I do know the source url though: https://www.learnpunjabi.org/stat_sound/1.wav. 
 But since we are talking 500 files this would take a long time.
 Is there an easier faster way with which i can download all the wav&#x27;s in bulk? I know python if that helps.

                              <span>This might interest some of you. SanDisk has a lifetime warranty on a lot of their flash media, including MicroSD cards, which I have a lot of for various uses. Their cards don&#x27;t fail on me often, but a couple times now, it&#x27;s happened. The first instance, my MicroSD card was replaced with another unit of the one that failed, as expected. But this recent failure was a 200GB card, and I guess they didn&#x27;t have any more 200GB cards laying around, because they sent me a 400GB card to replace it. Pretty good stuff.
 tl;dr SanDisk is real good with their warranties. Take advantage of them if you have the chance.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 So im doing some research on how events affect donation behaviour. I hope to match news coverage of a specific area with donations to its main NGO. I have the donations data - but I need to figure out to how to scrap data on news for this location (its usually on the news worldwide). What I mostly need is: date of news, is it generally positive or negative, and country(If possible). To some extent also &quot;intensity&quot; of coverage. Any ideas where I could start ? Pretty new on coding so maybe worth mentioning that

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve currently got a 14TB WD sitting on my desk full of legally ripped media and home movies. It was getting close to capacity so I picked up 3 more 14TB hard drives a few weeks ago during a sale. I have a total of 4 14TB HDDs now, 1 basically full. I&#x27;ve also got a 10TB synology DS220+ I back up critical files to that&#x27;s mostly empty. 
 I was thinking about going with single disk parity on TruNAS or Unraid. I&#x27;d set it up first with the 3 new drives and copy all my media over from my desk. Then I&#x27;d shuck the WD and add it to my server. I&#x27;d then then compress everything to a backup archive once a week and send it to my synology server (I can add 1 more drive to this if needed). 
 Thoughts on the setup? Also advice on TruNAS vs Unraid would be appreciated!

 I would most likely use the NAS for backups and not edit video from it or anything like that. Do you guys think I could trust these drives? Should I maybe way for a better deal?

 I&#x27;ve tried looking online but searching &quot;Wookieepedia archive&quot; only gives fandom articles on archives which exist in the SW universe.
 I just despise the fandom website so much that I wanted my own copy of the old Wookieepedia.

My solution for video storage is multiple external SSDs for different projects (four currently), but I don’t like them just rattling around in a pocket of my laptop bag. Does anyone know of a smallish storage case that will hold multiple SSDs? I’m imagining something like the CD wallet I used to carry in my car back before the days of MP3s. I can find soft cases meant for a single drive, but haven’t found anything that will hold multiple drives.

                              <span>I have 28TB in a Synology 5-bay NAS, and am reaching reasonable limits to upgrading within the five bays, so I was considering just building a custom NAS in an old PC case and running my storage/Plex of TrueNAS (haven&#x27;t decided yet fully). The current drives are all still good and I would like to reuse them, but the data is stored in an SHR raid. I have a cloud backup in Synology&#x27;s proprietary&#x27;s HyperBackup format.
 Is there a smart way of moving my data onto the new system once I have it set up, or do I need to download the backup data and hope all works out with the Synology backup explorer (which I can only really test once I&#x27;ve deleted the original SHR data off the hard drives)?

                              <span>what i&#x27;m looking to do is set up something to sync a folder on my desktop every couple of days to a folder on Box. i am on a company laptop so i can&#x27;t download any software or use Time Machine, even tho i&#x27;m on a mac, because they don&#x27;t allow apple IDs. 
 Is there another way to do this? i also have dropbox acct, is there a way to do it with that? i want the files to reside on my HD and just be synced/backed up to a cloud folder.

 I&#x27;ve created a tool to aid in downloading all the content from services.
 Currently it supports
  
Itch.io games
 Humble Bundle Library
 Opera Vision Performances
 NASA&#x27;s APOD (more of an example really)

 With Hacktoberfest this month, if people want to submit patches for different services, I&#x27;ll happily review and merge them

                              <span>How do you check if your videofiles dont have any problems after you get them?
 I mean stuff like, overall file corruption or that it didnt cut out in the middle of the episode (sth like autocompare the length to tvdb)
 Whats the best way to check for this (besides going through everything manually) bc the data it would need is already there. 
 Does a program for that already exist?

                              <span>I&#x27;m backing up 100+TB of data. Do you all configure your backup NAS to also have disk redundancy or do you just leave them as individual volumes and script out rsync or robocopy to backup individual folders from the main NAS?
 I&#x27;m thinking that if I skip RAID on this particular backup (non-critical data), that if a hard drive pukes on the backup NAS I will plug in a fresh hard drive and restore from the production NAS (RAID 6) and then I don&#x27;t have to blow money on extra $300 drives that I don&#x27;t need.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I have a question at the moment. When or with what reasons to create a new Docker stack for your self-containers?
 For context:
 I have a Synology NAS and I use Docker to run my applications. The *arr, Jellyfin, Heimdall, Calibre-web, Dazzle, Portainer, Duplicati, Vaultwarden, Watchtower, VPN client and 2 VPN connected download services and others.
 Portainer is run separately and all other services in a docker-compose (a stack in Portainer).
 The domain name and subdomains are managed by Synology.
 I want to add Swag instead of Synology&#x27;s reverse proxy. Because I have to open a lot of firewall ports to make it work with Synology&#x27;s reverse proxy and I don&#x27;t like it.
 After that, I want to use Home Assistant because I have many sensors in my apartment.
 Then add a Grafana to monitoring the services.
 And Authelia or Authentik
 So the stack is starting to have a lot of services. And I&#x27;m wondering if I should separate it or not. But I can&#x27;t think of any good reasons. And if I do. Do I have to manage 2 watchtower services and 2 swags? One per stack?
 ​
 Sorry for the language.
 Thx for the sharing

                              <span>I use a portainer stack for my docker compose and npm for my reverse proxy. Basically, I want to no longer be able to access the apps by typing in the ip:port, but through the reverse proxy. Would definitely love if there was some way I could do this in the portainer gui.
 My ultimate goal is to use the docker npm as the way to access my apps internally with simple names like homer.server.local or something like that. Then have another reverse proxy to use for external access pointing to the internal names.

                              <span>Hi everyone . I just came across a free waf like solution which integrates with Nginx.
 Openappsec.io
 Seems like it is made by Check Point . Looks to be better than everything else that available free from a WAF function perspective .
 Keen to see if anyone has any experiences with it ?

                              <span>Whilst this isn&#x27;t strictly selfhosted.. this &quot;server&quot; is part of my selfhosted solution so i hope you don&#x27;t mind..
 I run an Hp Microserver Gen 8 with a Xeon 1265L.. it&#x27;s got 2 16TB Red Pros in it..
 The OS is Windows 10 LTSC.
 There&#x27;s a couple of bus powered USB drives attached but for the majority of the day, it sits idle..
 It&#x27;s pullin a pretty constant 50w of power..
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why.. i&#x27;m hoping someone can tell me &quot;it&#x27;s your CPU&quot; or something similar to stop me endlessly searching for a software solution.
 CPU usage sits at around 14% due to Blueiris and Goodsync running..
 Any help to get this thing running a bit cheaper would be appreciated!

                              <span>My AWS SES credentials got leaked because of a dumb error on my part, and got picked up into a spam campaign that sent 70k emails. I&#x27;ve fixed the issue and locked things down, but all my personal emails are now going to spam, especially for gmail.
 I&#x27;ve gotten myself off of blocklists and my IP reputation and domain reputation shows to be okay on places like Talos and Spamhaus, however gmail still is marking my emails in spam.
 Is my domain permanently screwed now? I will never send any number of high volume emails from this domain because its for personal use only. Will it basically be impossible to rebuild my domain reputation because of low volume? Will the reputation recover over time even if I&#x27;m sending a very very low volume of emails?
 I don&#x27;t host my own email, I forward to Office 365, and use AWS SES to send automated emails to myself for home automation purposes. In hindsight I should&#x27;ve used a disposable domain for automated emails for this reason. 
 As much as possible, I&#x27;d like to keep this domain because it&#x27;s my family name.

                              <span>Hey!
 I&#x27;m getting more and more services in my selfhosted setup, some of them would benefit from having a mail account set up. So I was thinking about a mail server for just internal use. I would set it up with whatever DNS records are necessary and then restrict it again to local use. ideally, it comes with a web client.
 Any suggestions for what to use? Already checked out https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#communication---email---complete-solutions but can&#x27;t really decide, what&#x27;s useful.
 I&#x27;m running a Dell PC as server with Ubuntu 22.04 and Docker, I have a own (full) domain.

                              <span>I am trying out an Evernote replacement on Unraid using a Docker called Wiznote. Got it all working on a reverse proxy and the windows client, web client, and iOS client can all see the docker through my domain. However the time on the iOS app keeps coming up as UTC instead of GMT standard. 
 I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out how to change that. The windows client has the correct times however. Wiznotes support page mentions this but I have no idea how to enter the commands. Tried in console to no avail. Any help on how to do this and where greatly appreciated. Not so versed in console/terminal commands for linux. 
 &quot; 
 🕰Modify the Time Zone
 For example, change the time zone to UTC/GMT+08:00
 docker exec -it wiz /bin/bash cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime exit 
 ⏳Get local time zone
 Linux
 Add -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
 to the running command to get local time zone
 run --name wiz -it -d -v ~/wizdata:/wiz/storage -p 80:80 -p 9269:9269/udp -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime wiznote/wizserver 
 MacOS
 -e TZ&#x3D;&#x60;ls -la /etc/localtime | cut -d/ -f8-9&#x60;

                              <span>I have a query regarding a fresh install of wordpress in a docker container. I have my VPS, and my domain with Cloudflare points to it&#x27;s IP. I wish to use cloudflared to connect to the domain and any subs. Now, if I want wordpress installed to a subdomain &quot;wordpress.mydomain.com&quot;, do I have to change any ports in the docker-compose file? Or leave the default &quot;ports: - 8080:80&quot;? Or are there any other config or environmental variables I need to adjust?
 I will need to install nginx in a container afterwards as well, yes?
 I&#x27;d like the main url &quot;mydomain.com&quot; to host a different site/page, just a basic html/css entry page I can put together. And wordpress in the subdomain.
 Thank you.

                              <span>What happened?
 Hello all. I had to make a very painful data loss a few days ago due to an update error from NextCloudPi and had no backup for some now lost files.
 This now brings me to the point that I finally want to think about a backup strategy and I definitely need your help. I&#x27;ve always read a lot about this, but couldn&#x27;t really do anything with it because it was too abstract.
 What is the current status?
 I have a RAID 1 system with 2x 4TB NAS hard drives connected to my Ubuntu server. I never expected that a software error could delete all my cloud files, but now I&#x27;ve been proven wrong. I don&#x27;t do automated backups at all. At most, I manually copy the most important things to an external hard drive every few months.
 The file system is ext4.
 What I know could be helpful
 I know for example that there is btrfs as a file system and there is snapshot, but there it already starts, because I do not understand the functionality. Could that have helped me in my case where all the files were deleted? Then I know that there is rsync, which does more or less the same thing that RAID 1 already does (if I understood correctly).
 ​
 Of course, it would also be very efficient to save the data again on an external hard drive, for example. But I don&#x27;t know how this can be automated, because it would have to be connected all the time, which would quickly exceed the life of the hard drive. I definitely want to keep everything local and not fall back on external cloud providers such as Mega, Google, OneDrive, etc.
 ​
 So let&#x27;s first discuss the best realization in my case and possibly afterward how the whole thing is technically feasible. I want to make a backup of everything and not only of the data in the cloud but also of the rest. Thank you very much in advance!

 Are you aware of any Shuffle.dev alternative which allows to rapidly build the UI using components from some frameworks, such as Bootstrap, Bulma, or whatever?

 What hardware do you use to self-host? There are various options out there and there are different preferences. This poll could help get a picture of what is the preferred option in the community.

                              <span>My server runs on open media vault 6 with docker. I want an application where I can use smb and the suggested application together. I tried file browser(docker application, that I like), but I cant use file explorer on my main machine to add files which reflect in file browser. 
 My use case is this: I want to add/remove files from my server through smb but through the internet(globally).(please do not recommend nextcloud or file run, they don&#x27;t work on my server, how so many times I try). Basically I want to add files in my explorer which will get stored in my server, but accesible non-locally.
 I don&#x27;t know how clearly I have explained my use case, sorry if I couldn&#x27;t help you understand.I dont know how else to put this.
 Thanks for helping out in advance.

 I am looking for some basic app what would have the following features:
 - API
 - tasks properties like, due, label, title, desc, maybe custom one
 - projects (each project has own tasks)
 - project&#x27;s views (like see same tasks in different way like list or kanban)
 - filters and sort would be great
 ​
 ​
 Do you know something what may fit well? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I recently discovered this hobby of home server and inspired by posts here from dashboards full of apps, I decided to try to learn and do mine with a sbc that was lying around. I installed armbian and start to racking my brains trying to get started with docker.
 After I learned the basics of containers, I saw that it was relatively simple to deploy an application with docker, so a need arose: how will I be able to access them outside my local network? (By researching I found that accessing your local network through a vpn seems to be the easiest and most secure method).
 tl;dr: first I need to learn how to put domains on my local network instead of accessing the services by ip address and port. 
 e.g dashboard: 192.168.1.70:8080 -&gt; homer.pi 
 192.168.1.70:9000 -&gt; portainer.pi
 I didn&#x27;t find any guide for noobs, I just saw that I can do it through the pi-hole but I can&#x27;t direct to the ports, only to one address.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a way to load balance a media server between 2 sites connected via VPN with both sites hosting media files but the external IP pointing to one of the sites. I&#x27;m currently using Emby but the issue I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll run into is I&#x27;ve read the user &#x27;database&#x27; file isn&#x27;t able to be moved or copied while it&#x27;s open, so if a user connects to one server then disconnects and happen to reconnect to the other server depending on load, their &#x27;viewed programs&#x27; list or video resume point won&#x27;t be up to date.
 I&#x27;ve considered ESXi hosts at both locations that are able to clone but I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s real time nor bi-directional?
 Or can anyone suggest another self hosted software that might be able to do the same, Plex or something?

                              <span>I use cloudflare mainly for the hiding the IP part, although I appreciate the whole thing. For video selfhosted sites, cloudflare sometimes does weird things and also it is against their policies to stream. But I am wondering, how else can self hosters hide their IP without cloudflare? Is this something I need to worry about? I am planning on adding a firewall machine in front of everything soon anyway, but not sure if that addresses the same thing, probably not.

 It&#x27;s an online chat interface for SMS services provided by your own SIP provider using webhooks to send and receive.
 I&#x27;m getting ready to move a number I&#x27;ve used for a while to Flowroute, and I&#x27;d like to be able to send and receive messages in a similar way. I run FreePBX at home, but can&#x27;t find an integration that would provide what I&#x27;m looking for. 3CX PBX has an SMS/MMS chat feature, but it&#x27;s ~$150/year to use it.
 I&#x27;ve looked at Twilio, and they seem to have the APIs to do everything I want, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with any programming languages to write something to interface with it.
 I would love to be able to find something that works out of the box, but I&#x27;m open to something that would take a little work to get running.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can&#x27;t figure this problem out. I posted this before on here, but I cleaned the text up now and made the problem easier to understand, so I&#x27;m posting again. I&#x27;d appreciate any help on this as I&#x27;m really at my wits&#x27; end here.
 I&#x27;d like to use the NginxProxyManager container and have it only accessible when I connect to the server via Wireguard. But I can&#x27;t get it working.
 My configurations files are: - Wireguard compose file - NginxProxyManager compose file - What my firewall is currently like
 After deploying the previously mentioned files, I copied the Wireguard peer configuration into the app on my computer and connected to it. The issue is that nothing is accessible. I can&#x27;t Google anything, I can&#x27;t ping anything, and doing localhost:81 or server-ip:81 does nothing as well.
 I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a firewall issue either, as when I disable it on my server and try to access any site on my computer there&#x27;s no change.
 Here are the Wireguard and peer configuration files, with all keys redacted: - Wireguard configuration file - Peer configuration file
 I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s relevant but the proxy network in docker has a subnet of 172.18.0.0/16 and a gateway of 172.18.0.1.
 I feel like the issue may be the AllowedIPs section in wg0.conf but I&#x27;m not sure, plus since I have a dynamic IP how would I even have it in a form where I don&#x27;t need to keep on editing it every time my IP changes?

                              <span>Hi friends. We have a bargain outlet store locally and I looked in their locked high-tech cabinet today and noticed a Unifi UGS device was listed for $80 new in the box. Did a few searches and saw that it seemed like a good deal. I have always used the off the shelf routers like netgear....etc and figured this would be something fun to learn how to use and add to my home network. Can it be set up and used without having to purchase other devices? In other words replace my Netgear router for starters?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I don&#x27;t know if it is the right subreddit to post this, but I believe it will fit.
 I&#x27;m actually the happy owner of a dell R715 (Dual AMD Opteron 6320 + 256GB of DDR3 ECC). And I just setup jellyfin on it and then I wondered if I could put a GPU inside the server. Hopefully this server already have x16 pci riser so I could put any gpu I wanted. But I noticed that this server doesn&#x27;t have any extra plug to add more powerful GPU like some server do. 
 So at first my head turned over my collection of old GPU, and I wonder if any of them could help in that regards (even just a little bit):
  
ATI RADEON HD X1300
 ATI RADEON HD 2400 PRO
 ATI RADEON HD 2400XT
 ATI RADEON HD 3450
 ATI RADEON HD 6350
 NVIDIA QUADRO FX 370
 NVIDIA GEFORCE 6200TC
 NVIDIA 7300GS
 NVIDIA 8400GS
  
The Radeon 6350 is the most recent of the bunch if i&#x27;m not mistaken, but I don&#x27;t know if it is useful or not in this scenario.
 I&#x27;m also wondering what if I buy a new GPU, what is the best cheap GPU for this purpose (used or new) Should I buy an older quadro ? Should I buy a 1030 or 1650 ? And what would be the downside of each ?
 Thank you for any help ! Have a nice day !

 As the title suggests, I need help. Since Dell decided to downgrade their user experience by pulling the platform specific bootable ISO, we&#x27;ve been force to use the repository manager, except the user experience of it is the equivalent of rubbing my bare genitals against hot gravel, and fails to produce anything bootable, when it does decide to download something.
 ​
 I was wondering if anyone had one they backed up or saved.

I&#x27;m considering offering to just pay him for it and give the other person a refund to keep things easy if I can find a use for it.

 So far I&#x27;ve scored a couple of Dell T5810s workstation and an unmanaged 5-port switch as well as two Thinkpads for my homelab. I don&#x27;t know how I can start to begin processing it as I am somewhat of a novice, but I&#x27;ve got a couple of idea. The workstations themselves I think are around on the older side of Intel Xeon processors, and are mostly 16GB of ram without any sort of max storage. My idea was to get a couple of SSDs &amp; HDDs and two more graphic cards (one is rocking a 1060, so I&#x27;ll probably grab a few more or update to a 1660) to do some machine learning, but I don&#x27;t know where to start on that end.
 My eventual goal as someone who want to potentially be an IT professional, I want to at least have an environment where

                              <span>I am looking for a new case and not really wanting a rack mount flat case but am willing to use one. 
 My budget is about $150. Need good airflow on the drives. I currently have an old Phanteks enthoo something with 8x8tb drives. Two of the drives are in the bottom of the case with no air flow, so I run the case without the front panel and a box fan in front of it, obviously not ideal I am ready to move on.
 I do not have a rack and not going that route, but if some type of rack mount style is the only thing with good airflow for 10x drives I would be willing to make it work. My mobo is mATX if that matters.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;d like to replace my enterprise servers with something less (noise-making, power-hogging, heat-creating, space-occupying) and more (processing power, memory).
 Currently I&#x27;m using Proxmox to run 3 or 4 VMs on an ML110G7 with 16GB that&#x27;s been working fine for years, but the E3-1220 is starting to pant a bit under load. It&#x27;s hosting Homeassistant (OS) , Jellyfin, LMS/Subsonic and Piwigo, each on separate guest machines (I know I could run them all in docker, but.. I don&#x27;t wanna).
 My thoughts are to replace the ML with either a couple of HP Elite or ProDesk minis for a slight processing upgrade, or a single Beelink SER with a Ryzen 5 or 7 for a bigger bump. Prices are roughly comparable for 2x micro business desktops or one beefier Beelink. Think around $500 CAD.
 I don&#x27;t need dual NICs (or &gt;1Gbps), don&#x27;t need more GPU grunt than the iGPUs, and 32GB ram is plenty for the use case, so expandability isn&#x27;t a concern. 
 Your thoughts on mini business DTs vs Beelink (or similar) mini-pcs?

                              <span>I have a cyberpower UPS battery 1500VA with a odd enviroment
 Situation: there is a powercut in my house and UPS ran out of battery after some minutes.
 When power returns, seconds later i turn on the UPS battery and it shows a 100% charged battery!! (which have no sense)
 later, when there is another powercut, UPS battery ran out of energy in seconds too... (like never charged)
 this is a issue with the battery so i have to replace it? or is directly a UPS glitch so i have to get a new UPS?
 or every time UPS get out of battery i must wait 12 hours letting charging turned off and all the previous is an expected environment? 
 PD: didn&#x27;t found a UPS battery group here in reddit, only the UPS delivery service xD sorry if here is not the appropiate place
 thanks in advance

                              <span>I have an probably 10 year old Alienware desktop I&#x27;ve been thinking about turning into a server. I&#x27;m not planning or running very much on it, but I&#x27;m an IT student and it would be nice to have a home server to mess around with and test out things on. I&#x27;m concerned however about the power draw because I don&#x27;t want to spike my energy bill if I have it running 24/7. If I&#x27;m not running very much on it would the power draw still be pretty high, or would it scale more to the amount of use it gets?

 First of all, lemme tell you that I love this subreddit :) Second of all, over the past few years and with my recent purchase of a Dell Powervault unit, I figured it&#x27;s a good opportunity to spend some time and budget to figure a rack solution once for all and make sure things can run 24/7. The only issue is I live in a small apartment and this Dell unit I bought is way nosier than I could&#x27;ve imagined. I explored immersion cooling and quite server cabinets (cuz I am a noise freak) but the price for both of these were quite hefty and opening a brand new dell storage to do DIY cooling in 4u is also not an option because it messes up with the warranty and same thing is almost true with immersion cooling as well.
 So, in the end, I found myself thinking more about different spaces in…</span>

                              <span>Since neither my country require, nor our phone provider have a designated demarcation point on-premise (you are even allowed to run the cable up until the neighborhood cabinet, but not inside it), and I finally have the tools required to diagnose our issues, I have decided to start testing (and at the same time, identify which socket is connected where)... Only problem is, I have no idea what to make of the connectors, since while I know that only two wires connect each socket (we have a similar system to BT&#x27;s here in the walls, however it is wired differently, with the red wire at pin 3 and the blue wire at pin 4), I cannot seem to understand how to test points that have 4 wires connected (two at the top, two at the bottom).
 Of course, I have disconnected the home phone and the DSL (technically VDSL2, with support for at least profile 30a, perhaps profile 35b, although it only has a 100Mbps RJ-45 port) modem/wired router beforehand, and only reconnected them to post this.
 Here is a picture to illustrate what I mean: https://0x0.st/o49r.jpg (I cannot seem to upload to IMGUR with Sync for Reddit)
 I do plan to replace all of our BT sockets with RJ-11 sockets, just to make troubleshooting far easier, since most equipment cannot connect directly to BT for testing (I also need to test cables, after all), with LeGrand&#x27;s modules making things easier for me there (I will be running both CAT5e for phone and CAT6A for networking, in preparation for my future homelab, after all), and for that I first need to ascertain what plugs where, especially since I need to move where the DSL modem/wired-router is physically connected.

 Hey guys - current config is internet into my Asus router, which has been great but it&#x27;s reached end-of-software-support and my (wired) network is getting too big for it, so I&#x27;ve roped in another wifi router with NAT turned off to give me +4 RJ45 ports... not ideal. 
 So anyway, I just built a pfSense box and I have a 24-port Cisco 3560 I found in the trash at work. So my plan is as in the linked image at top:
 Internet into pfSense, then on into the Cisco (SFP port 1). SFP port 2 of the Cisco (SFP) will go into the Asus in WAP mode to handle the wifi traffic.
 This page ( https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-vlans-in-pfsense/ ) gives a decent overview of setting up VLANs to segregate traffic but it indicates I&#x27;ll need to assign VLANs in the switch as well. I can do this but then it begs the question about wireless devices... 
 I imagine the &quot;Trusted Systems&quot; VLAN devices will have access to each other, the internet, and my file server.
 IOT will have access to each other and pfSense NTP.
 Guest will have access only to the internet.
 Since wireless devices will all be coming into the Cisco through one SFP port, I can&#x27;t just assign that port to one VLAN; if pfSense is handling DHCP, presumably I can use different subnets for the devices by individually assigning IPs.
 By default, new devices would be part of Guest until moved into Trusted or IOT... which is the gap in my current understanding. 
 Thoughts? What am I missing here? Thanks in advance! I&#x27;m happy to learn by messing around but since I&#x27;ll be taking down the entire home network to do this, hopefully it doesn&#x27;t take too long. ;)

So with that in mind, how do you all store all of your spare parts so it doesn&#x27;t look crummy? I have dozens of sticks of memory, hundreds of screws, various expansion cards, multiple video cards, motherboards, HSF assemblies, I mean you name it and I&#x27;ve probably got a dozen or more.

                              <span>On and off for the past few years I have been working on getting a server online for running Home Assistant OS in a VM, Blue Iris (originally), Frigate NVR in Docker (now), and a few other software packages.
 I originally settled on a Intel® Xeon® Processor E3-1225 v6 and an HP DL20 G9.
 Unfortunately, the server chipset disabled the internal GPU and Quicksync with it.
 So I got a Supermicro SuperServer 5019S-ML. The X11SSH-F motherboard supported integrated graphics and the CPU/RAM I already had. I got it running and everything seemed great until Windows update kicked in. The server works with integrated graphics, but also has the Supermicro IPMI Out-of-Band Management that requires its own unique driver.
 As such, the moment Windows update kicked in, the graphics crashed. Additionally, a…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I am currently using SyncbackFree V10 to backup my files locally. However, the free version does not support versioning and the license for the paid version is valid only for the version that you paid for. Currently they are in V10 and I&#x27;m not sure when they will update to V11. I&#x27;m worried that if I pay for V10, they will update to V11 very quickly, then I have to pay again. 
 For cloud backup, I currently don&#x27;t have any. I do have a Nextcloud server set up and is using the Nextcloud software to sync certain folders/files.
 I&#x27;m trying to see if there are better alternatives, free or paid. If free, I need versioning as my critical files are changing everyday and I schedule daily backups for those files &amp; folders. If paid, is there a better licensing method compared to Syncback?
 My requirements are as follows:
 1) Local backups and Nextcloud server backups
 2) Able to choose which folders/files to backup for Nextcloud separately from local backups
 3) Versioning
 4) Incremental Backup
 5) Scheduling
 6) File integrity check
 7) Need to be able to restore individual files
 8) I&#x27;m not sure if I need image backups as sometimes I like to wipe my computer clean and reinstall only the software that I really need at that time. A lot of crap can build up over months/years of using the computer and I do not want those crap to be restored.

                              <span>Hi there, since R18 is scheduled to be shutdown, i was wondering if anyone has ripped all the metadata on that site? Their search was amazing.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m an aspiring data hoarder with no coding, Linux, or PC building experience (though I&#x27;d be open to trying these things) who is in need of a personal data storage/server solution.
 I would like a storage solution that can hold on to at least 20TB of files without risk of sudden failure (&quot;redundancy drive&quot; seems to be a key term here). It needs to be able to handle multiple python scripts running at all times to record Twitch streams while serving video via Plex or Jellyfin.
 Bonus points for upgradability. The cheaper the solution that meets all these requirements, the better. Feel free to go over on price as much as needed. I&#x27;m aware that $500 is probably optimistic.

                              <span>I want to have my data, which is currently about 1.8 TB, encrypted and secured with a filesystem having the nice features of checksumming and compression.
 My storage media: 
  
My Passport (WDC WD20NMVW-11EDZS2) 2TB USB external HDD (My main disk)
 An old 1TB laptop HDD (2.5”) now in an HDD caddy inside my laptop
 An old 1TB 3.5” HDD that connects via a SATA-USB adapter
  
The latter two disks have successfully gone through badblocks and smartctl tests, so I assume they are wiped and ready to go.
 I use a 250GB SSD for my Windows and Linux dual-boot installation, and I don&#x27;t intend to include it in my setup.
 Unfortunately, at this moment I can&#x27;t afford adding a new device (I live in a very poor country with hyperinflation).
 BTRFS and ZFS seem to be the most popular and suitable ones for me, but don’t know if BTRFS has completely healed its bad reputation. ZFS sounds interesting and I really want to learn it, but I don’t know if ZFS is recommendable for my small setup, plus, my RAM is 12GB and non-ECC . I’ve also read about some filesystems that would cause problems if you run out of space, I want to avoid them.
 The ability to access the FS on Windows is good, but not completely necessary. WinBTRFS doesn’t seem to be 100% reliable to not corrupt the data on Windows… but not sure.
 So what filesystem do you recommend to me? What encryption scheme is recommended? I’ve heard that some filesystems have builtin encryption. I assume, first I have to create an encrypted filesystem on the two other HDDs and copy the files to them. Then I should wipe the external HDD, and create a filesystem on it and copy the files back.
 Your help would be much appreciated.

 Is this the same as most people or are some hitting limits?

As far as I know, Exos are the best TB-per-dollar but also the loudest drives so I want to know if getting WD Red or Red Plus is better if I don&#x27;t want the system to be loud. (8 to 12TB drives)
 It&#x27;s just for multimedia storage btw

                              <span>I understand this is very much a non-issue, but the current FAQ section under our Wiki is... not good. The only potentially good thing(s) are the two links to more information on downloading reddit profiles. We (and by we, I mean the mods) should either make an actual FAQ or just remove the section entirely.
 Again, I know it&#x27;s a non-issue, just wanted to post my thoughts. Being stuck at home with covid is boring.

                              <span>I only have a laptop. I guess that rules out 3.5” hard disks which I read here as good ones.
 I don’t have data more than 2TB right now. So I want to buy a 2TB HDD. But I read here that 2.5” hdd below 8TB are generally SMR and not that great quality wise.
 I have a sale going on in my country on WD and Seagate HDD. 
 Question:is it a good decision to buy a 2TB wd or seagate HDD or shell out more money and buy 3.5” HDD with a case to use with a laptop? 
 I want to use this as a backup hard disk.

The database should contain name of person, Twitter handle, Twitter followers, the actual tweets written by the person, the likes and shares for each tweet. Does anyone know of a database or a website that might store some of this information.? Anything is much appreciated, I&#x27;ll just create the database little by little. I know it&#x27;s possible to scrape Twitter but not for the volume I want

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I neglected my backups. There, I said it. I gotta change something about it though and I would like to learn about the dos and don&#x27;ts.
 I got a small server I would like to backup. I intend to use restic for it.
 Is the following approach already fine? Or am I missing something?
  
There&#x27;s a restic repository on the server where I backup my files to.
 I sync the restic repository to an external drive.
 I sync the external drive to another external drive (weekly).
 I upload the contents of the external drive into my cloud.
  
Thanks a lot!

                              <span>So due to many terrible political decisions made recently and not-so-recently, electricity prices in the UK are rising absurdly quickly at the moment. 
 Just over 2 years ago we were paying 13.31p/kWh. Prices more than doubled in April this year and are going up again now to 34p/kWh. Business rates are as high as 93p/kWh.
 I&#x27;m currently running a 12 bay Supermicro server with 128 GB RAM and dual Xeon E5-2650 v2. It uses approx 4.2 kWh per day so running costs have gone up from £17/month to £44/month and are set to rise more soon.
 I&#x27;d like to move to a more power efficient option to save money. I don&#x27;t desperately need the dual Xeons, all I need is the following
  
10-12 bays
 enough processing/GPU to be able to run Plex for 1-2 people
 2 ethernet ports
 quiet enough in a cupboard
 nice to have at least one ethernet port 10 GbE
  
If I can spend a few hundred quid on lower-power hardware, I&#x27;ll make my money back in a couple of years.
 What are my options? I&#x27;m up for any ideas about more efficient hardware than can still hold a decent number of drives. I&#x27;d probably prefer not to build in a PC case as I&#x27;m sure there are lower power prebuilt options but I&#x27;m open to almost anything.

 I am trying to get a hold of them. I remember many many articles changing and entire articles removed that used to exist. I am trying hard to find one of these dvd&#x27;s.

 *Update: I was able to download a 200gb tar file of an old wikipedia, but now every app I try to use to open it crashes. File&#x27;s too big :(

I went to the wiki on this sub and I tried YouTube-dl-gui but it was taking forever to even download one video. Is there a way to speed up the download for that or is there a better program to use.

Either option has 2 x m.2 slots - any idea if they support RAID 1 with NVMe drives? I&#x27;ve been digging around and haven&#x27;t found the answer.

 What this does. It automatically reads and writes enough &quot;random&quot; to your disk drive optimizing your $badclustr file to lock out all the bad spots on your disk.
 Application? Particularly useful on worn out disks, but will work with new also. Unattended cleanup so you can use that disk again (or use it for cold archives).

                              <span>on the 29th march, 2019, this video was uploaded to youtube. This is a public record of an aim game, currently world record.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;brS9f4qaSQk&amp;t&#x3D;7s&amp;ab_channel&#x3D;NeoNinja
 However, on the 25th april 2018, a previous video of this same aim game was uploaded, with the youtube ID https://youtu.be/1qL0rFGB2LA
 The reason why this is so significant is because the score difference between them is about 5 seconds of gameplay. almost a whole year of training to gain 5 seconds on an aim game (because it is so difficult).
 the only place i&#x27;ve seen a snipper of the old aim video is here, at this timestamp specifically. https://youtu.be/E8NtJtyKX-Y?t&#x3D;133
 I&#x27;ve searched twitter, old video statistic websites, old forums. Through these searches, I even found a video uploaded the day…</span>

                              <span>I am sure many of you know this already, but Newegg has been selling the Exos 14TB (new) for $199.99 over the last few weeks. Today, with the new ZIP buy-now-pay-later 15% off promotion, the price is $170, which equates to $12/TB. You can save up to $100 on the promo, which is perfect for 3 drives (save $90).
 I know there are concerns about Newegg packaging and warranty, but this seems too good to pass up. My first time buying drives - I think you can just return them if they are damaged / not covered by Seagate warranty right?

                              <span>So I thought I future proofed myself for longer than I did but I&#x27;m getting to 70% used on my array and starting to look at expanding again. My problem is I have already used all of my pcie lanes and probably am overusing the pch as well and trying to figure out the best option to start adding more vdevs. 
 My goal is actually to add 4-6 20tb drives and 2 1tb ssds but I&#x27;m about out of sata ports before I even got to this point. Is it worth looking at threadripper or some cheaper modern xeons? 
 My current system running trunas core:
 11600k 32gb ram(probably need to up this to at least 64gb) 8 18tb hdds 3 2tb nvme 10gb mellonox card Lsi expansion that supports 8 drives.
 The motherboard has 4 sata ports but is using one for the boot drive and my thought was two other ones for the additional 1tb ssds.
 Just trying to see if anyone has run into a similar issue. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s better to just get threadripper or a newer xeon/epyc or maybe at this point just source a cheap small system and have a secondary volume.

                              <span>Would it be possible to use the whole ssd in slc &quot;mode&quot; or would it not allow you to do it? Sure you will lose a bunch of disk space, going down to a third maybe? But I would still like to experiment with it. 
 Could also be an ok way to make a slc cache drive since they aren&#x27;t made anymore(?).

                              <span>(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T)
 Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but mighty NAS (mini-ITX) which is also going to he used as a web server, and one of the &quot;requirements&quot; are that jt should ideally consume as less power as possible since it&#x27;s going to stay on 24/7.
 Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:
  
TDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T
 frequencies, including the base frequency
  
So, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it&#x27;s the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.
 So yea I understand that the T under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.
 My concern is the following.
 When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? 
 The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.
 Is this understanding correct, or am I missing something?
 I&#x27;m asking here as there&#x27;s plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.
 Any advice or insights is very much appreciated.
 Thanks a lot! 😊

I’m now moving the data from it to another drive and it’s moving data fine but a few file are inaccessible unfortunately..can improper ejecting of a hardrive whilst writing to it cause bad sectors as it was totally fine before this ?? 
 Is this drive reusable? Please help my fellow data heads ⭐️😎

 But any form of file transfer from anywhere to the external hdd, or even a folder transfer within the external hdd resets the usb system(all connections reboot) it works fine on my desktop so the drive is I know the drive is fine. 
 I’d appreciate any tips or ideas? Part of me thinks it’s a permission issue within the drive but I have no way to be sure.

 (link is invalid, just an example)
 I tried putting the magnet link from an ed2k file onto a document.txt and upload it to IA but it seems it&#x27;s not finding the files. I&#x27;m not sure if IA can do the same with these as it can with torrent magnet links (paste the link on a text file, rename to something.torrent and IA will download the contents). I can&#x27;t seem to find the help page either where I saw this before, am under the impression AI could also grab ed2k/Kad metalinks but from my testing it can&#x27;t. I&#x27;m sharing the file correctly and it has a couple more seeds.

                              <span>Hello, all of my mad data lads! I currently have a Supermicro Unraid setup with 130TBs of storage that I use primarily for Plex and personal video storage and I need your help.
 I started a pretty decent non-prof sports photography/videography business and am in need of a big time storage solution for long-term archival and some everyday usage. I wanted to build this out more &quot;officially&quot; and efficiently than my little at-home setup so I figured I would ask for some advice here. I&#x27;m also willing to &quot;hire&quot; someone (just out of my own pocket) if there was someone out there that could help me design and put a build together. 
 So my use case, here is what I am looking to do:
  
Have long-term storage for photos and primarily video of Las Vegas High School sports (we are starting with boys and girls basketball this year)
 Being able to store game film from every high school game each season and archive that footage for 10-20 years.
 Have a storage solution that will allow multiple video editors and contributors to edit video (premiere and final cut) from different storage areas directly (will have 5 Mac Studio computers located locally within the same office at the servers, so could do 10GBE runs, etc).
  
Based on the personal storage I have been using for the last 6 months of filming myself I can see how this is going to scale at a massive level and put me in what I would consider the &quot;DataHoarder&quot; zone! I appreciate any assistance from the community I could get for this and hopefully this post is in the right place.

                              <span>I have two servers locally that I want to verify that the data is truly a clone. What would be the best method to run a sha1/256 check against both copies and verify that they are truly the same? Both of these servers run Debian.
 Thanks
 Obviously I&#x27;m talking about datahoarder quantities, 100+ TB ~1,000,000 files

                              <span>Howdy. Picked up my first hard drive today and I&#x27;m pretty blown away by just how much space these bad boys have. I wanted to ask, how long do these things last? I&#x27;ve got the thing hooked up right next to my PS5, but I&#x27;ve got some concerns.
 Just how durable are these things, anyway? Will a power outage turn my data into Swiss cheese? Is there a shock-resistant case or something I can put around it? Is the 1% failure rate actually true? Or is that just a marketing thing? I really don&#x27;t know!
 So yeah. Apologies for the noobie questions, I just really want to make the most out of this thing without somehow screwing myself over.
 EDIT: Jeez. You guys are so passive aggresive. What&#x27;s wrong with you people?

                              <span>tl;dr: if an Intel X540 overheats - what it do? does performance just drop or does it disconnect? I was under the impression of the latter. 
 anti tl;dr: I have two Intel X540s - one in my main PC (Windows 10), one in my server/NAS (Server 2022). Until today they were setup direct-attach. 
 Large transfers of single files (&gt; ~5GB) will start out saturating 10 GbE for a bit, drop to zero and hang, then pick back up. It&#x27;ll repeat it a few times over the course of a transfer. 
 On a 60GB mkv it happens about a half dozen times (all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it). Smaller files (&lt; ~5GB) are a non-issue. 
 I bought the NICs about two years ago and and tried to figure it out but couldn&#x27;t and assumed it was a quirk of direct attach. 
 Then I got a deal on a 10 GbE switch (Ubiquiti USW-Flex-XG) and set it up today. I made my X540s my primary NICs in each aaaaaaaand the problem is worse. I&#x27;m not even hitting 5 GbE, let alone 10 GbE. 
 Here&#x27;s iPerf3 - the result is the same in either direction.
 Here&#x27;s an actual transfer - all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn&#x27;t look like it. this is to/from an NVME but it happens with any combination of drives (SATA SSDs, RAID 0 HDD array, other NVME). 
 The only thing I can come up with is maybe an overheating NIC? the X540 in my server has a 40mm fan strapped on it (because there&#x27;s room). The X540 in my main PC doesn&#x27;t have a fan because there&#x27;s no room for it and the heatsink is lava. but I was under the impression the NIC would drop if it overheats?
 Windows, Intel ProSET, and Ubiquiti all show 10 GbE. I also tried taking them off auto-negotiate and no difference. 
 Any big brains got any ideas?

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve come across a Synology RS812RP+ for sale with 4 2TB Red drives included for £40. It&#x27;s pretty cheap but I&#x27;m aware it&#x27;s a really old bit of kit (2013). Despite that, is £40 worth it to just have a NAS as I don&#x27;t have one currently, or am I just paying to shift someone&#x27;s e-waste for them?

                              <span>Anyone have experience booting proxmox raid on bifurcated NVMEs on an r730?
 Ive tried using Clover, editing the image to load the NVME driver. Also tried proxmox bootloader.
 Proxmox installs on the MVMEs after creating the raid in the installer, but never boots to it after reboot.

                              <span>Hey. I know this question has been asked before but I still can&#x27;t find an answer that solves the problem I&#x27;m having.
 I have 3 systems, 1st my day-to-day Windows desktop, 2nd my Windows &#x27;cloud gaming&#x27; VM, and 3rd my TrueNAS system. My goal is to have all my games from Steam, Epic, Origin and GOG all installed to a Networked Drive/Folder that&#x27;s stored on the TrueNAS system, which is then accessible to my 1st and 2nd system.
 Most guides suggest mapping my network drive as normal and installing the games there. This however causes permission issues, which can sometimes be solved by mapping in privileged mode and others, games won&#x27;t even attempt to start.
 Another option which worked fine was mapping an iSCSI drive. However, this has the problem that only 1 system can access the drive (apparently you can have multiple, but it&#x27;s highly discouraged?). It also seems it&#x27;s only really good to set an allocated volume size, not just expand the until the drives get full. If I could do iSCSI, would this bypass the RAM and SSD cache I have for that pool?
 So my questions are, what should I do? and Is there an alternative I&#x27;m missing?

 I got an unused Fujitsu Futro PC here with a Intel Celeron J4105 and 8GB of RAM here. It only supports a single M.2 SSD, I had a 1TB drive lying around, that i built into it. I&#x27;d like to use this PC as a little NAS, to put some files onto it and make them accessible on my network. I would also like to put some videos and music on it and be able to stream it to my smartphone and TV at my home. 
 Which operating system would be the best fit for that? I looked into truenas and plex, but I don&#x27;t know if they are the best choice.

I&#x27;ve settled on two options I can find:
 AsRock Rack EPYC3101D4I-2T - EPYC 3101 4C/4T
 SuperMicro X10SDV-4C-TLN2F - Xeon D 1521
 The problem is I&#x27;m not sure how CPU constrained I will be with these boards given ZFS and the throughput NVMe can achieve, or if there are other options for boards.

                              <span>(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T, since I still have to decide what CPU to go for, but first I need to fully understand the T-series vs non-T matter)
 Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but relatively mighty NAS (mini-ITX, with Unraid) which is also going to be used as a web server, and one of the &quot;requirements&quot; are that it should ideally consume as less power as possible since it&#x27;s going to stay on 24/7.
 Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:
  
TDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T
 frequencies, especially the base frequency
  
So, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it&#x27;s the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.
 So yeah I understand that the T-series under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.
 My concern is the following.
 When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? 
 The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.
 Does this translate in less energy used by the T-series if compared to the non-T when both are subject to the same light load?
 Is this understanding correct, or am I missing anything?
 I&#x27;m asking here as there&#x27;s plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.
 Any advice or insights is really appreciated.
 Thank you very much! 😊

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out an easy (and safe) way to connect to my home servers while I&#x27;m at traveling or at work. I have a handful of local servers, but the only internet facing boxes are the Jellyfin server and Minecraft server. The others (Home Assistant, proxmox, etc.) I am not quite comfortable port forwarding to the open web for security reasons.
 That being said, I would really like to be able to access some of these things from outside of my home network, and I would like to be able to do so safely.
 Obviously RDP is off the table, and I was cautioned against using VNC for similar reasons. My question for everybody: how are you all connecting to your home servers? It&#x27;s probably something simple I&#x27;m overlooking, but it would be so nice to use!

 I tried adding &quot;resolvectl domain %i internal.example.com&quot; to the end of the postup config. But the docker container doesn&#x27;t contain resolvectl so it fails
 I&#x27;ve tried editing the search domains of the host, which does pass to the container, no luck
 I&#x27;ve tried mounting a custom resolv.conf into the container, no luck
 There has got to be a way!

 so what is the end difference between them?
 should i get a nx300 or a r410 for a NAS?

                              <span>I have synology router and it lets me assign a network to each port so Im able to have multiable networks and subnets, and if you have a managed switch you could always use vlans. so yea.. I see some people get more than 1 router to have muliable lans but you can do such with a switch or just 1 router.

                              <span>I setup a Dell PowerEdge R510 server with Hyper-V 2016 on bare metal headless install years ago. It has treated me great and I have no issues *that I know of*...
 I have 10 older hard drives (that I bought used) installed in RAID 6 for non-important data, and then 2 newer hard drives in RAID 1. Being a R510 everything is older inside including the RAID card and iDRAC.
 When I try to access the iDRAC via old IE, Chrome, or FF I get: ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH 
 I think the iDRAC is too old? I don&#x27;t know the version/model off hand, I don&#x27;t have a need to reboot it to get that info at this point. When I did the install I was able to get into the iDRAC but didn&#x27;t find it useful or prob more honestly didn&#x27;t know how to use it... But now I can&#x27;t get in without full blown troubleshooting and downtime.
 Is there any way to monitor OS health/stats, HDD health, and maybe even get alerts/emails when things change if the iDRAC is dead/old?

 I&#x27;ve set up the server.yaml with the base_url and behind_proxy.. i&#x27;m obviously missing something from the NPM config.. but i&#x27;m just not sure which bits from the documentation i need.
 I&#x27;m running NTFY using the ubuntu repo and have it running on port 82.

It doesn&#x27;t have a simple docker setup like Amazon has but it has ssh access. So I feel like it should be possible. All the instructions I find are how to do it on your local machine, which isn&#x27;t what I want to do. 
 Is there a simple guide to getting docker up and running on a server?

But I dont really know if I can trust the source of the app. I figure it cant hurt to try it out, but I&#x27;d like to be able to monitor the server for a while and make sure its not trying to phone home, or make any other odd network connections. 
 I have looked into Wireshark, but it is very overwhelming, and even after watching some guides Im not confident in my ability to set it up to watch for the right stuff.

                              <span>Hi All.
 I&#x27;ve set up Cloudflare to expose some self hosted apps to the web. I&#x27;ve used the Windows tutorials for setting up a tunnel (here) and installing as a windows service (here). 
 However, I&#x27;m having two problems:
 1) The tunnel doesn&#x27;t seem to automatically re-establish after a reboot, but I thought that was the whole point of installing as a service? I need to manually start the tunnel every time
 2) When I manually start the tunnel in powershell, it seems to hang after:

 Wondering if anyone has come across this before, and maybe knows of a fix? My Googleing didn&#x27;t find any solutions.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve done plenty of research and didn&#x27;t find anything like that working on Linux, the most promising would seem:
 Manage engine - Looks great but only working on windows (apparently there&#x27;s a free cloud-version too for now), a solution for self hosting on Linux would be running a VM with windows and installing it there, i don&#x27;t know if a poor raspberry 4 could handle that tho
 Spiceworks.com - Only for windows and no future development for Linux in their program
 There&#x27;s also Flyve but looks like it&#x27;s kind of abandoned, little to no documentation available and installing seems quite challenging.
 I&#x27;m searching for something i can self host on a rapsberry pi and access over my network, would be great with a dashboard on apache.
 But i&#x27;m open to other variables

                              <span>Hello,
 since the first version of paperless-ngx I use - 1.9.0 and today 1.9.2, I have a problem,
 that processing some files of the queue starts but never ends.
 Instead I can see in the Docker Logs teh following: 
 16:21:02 [Q] INFO Process-1:4 processing [file.pdf]
 [2022-09-29 16:21:04,113] [INFO] [paperless.consumer] Consuming file.pdf
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Enqueued 1
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Process-1 created a task from schedule [Check all e-mail accounts]
 16:24:09 [Q] ERROR reincarnated worker Process-1:4 after death
 ​
 I am not sure, where the problem could be, has anyone experienced similar issues?
 Appearently, I cannot share this exact file, but If you&#x27;d like to try on your instance, I have a Datasheet as PDF which does not get consumed either.

 I created a webapp to store coupons, discounts and loyalty cards. Several barcodes are supported. It helps me to get rid of a couple of physical loyalty cards in my wallet, as I can scan the barcodes on the phone.
 The app is self-hostable and open source. Feedback is very welcome: https://github.com/metikular/coupon-store

                              <span>Hey reddit!
 Just a refresher: Last week I announced Fasten, a self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 1000&#x27;s of insurances/hospitals/clinics 
 Here&#x27;s a couple of screenshots that&#x27;ll remind you what it looks like:
 Fasten Screenshots 
  
Your interest in Fasten was overwhelmingly positive, and its obvious this is worth pursuing further!
 I&#x27;m happy to announce that I have a &quot;Beta&quot; version that&#x27;s available for testing.
 Having said that, there are some limitations to this Beta
  
You can only connect to Sandbox accounts on the healthcare providers (no real/personal accounts yet).
 It&#x27;s only packaged as a Docker image
 Search is disabled
 There&#x27;s no background processing, so healthcare provider access tokens will expire (and need reconnect…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a self hosted music player were you can create &quot;stations&quot; or &quot;channels&quot;.
 
 For example, I have a &#x27;Christmas&#x27; directory of mp3s. I&#x27;d like to create a &#x27;Christmas Channel&#x27; that randomly plays one of those to any client listening. (it doesn&#x27;t have to be directory based, using tags or database or whatever would work too). Same for a &#x27;Hard Rock&#x27; directory or such. 
 Or even having a static playlist would work, as long as it&#x27;s saved server side and all clients can access it.
 
 Ideally I&#x27;d also like an android app/client - but having a good mobile webpage would also work.

                              <span>Finally I decided to dump over 5k photos out of my memory card in my digital camera and try to organize them with some self hosted service. I rearranged them to a year-month folder structure using local tools (exiftool) and upload them to my server. I also have two rolls of scanned films without proper EXIF info, which are placed in dedicated folders.
 I give both LibrePhotos and PhotoPrism a quick test since they don&#x27;t touch the structure of original files so I can run them both at the same time.
 Unique LibrePhotos Feature I like: Auto event albums. Super convenient as it basically just needs timestamp. I mainly use my dc to record my dates and LibrePhotos successfully identified most of them. 
 PhotoPrism has Moments but it seems to have more strict rules. PhotoPrism only identified 3 m…</span>

                              <span>This is a hardware-related self hosting question -- hopefully that is okay. :)
 So, I have an old HP inkjet/scanner combo I&#x27;ve been using forever, to scan full sheets. It does great work but it&#x27;s been making odd noises lately and I know it won&#x27;t last forever.
 I&#x27;d like to use something to scan things like invoices and receipts, doing so under Unix/Linux.
 Bonus points if I can do the scanning on the command line -- my current solution I have to use X windows and a graphical tool to capture the image(s).
 I&#x27;m using a self-authored tool with this stuff to manage finances. Right now I just used it for full invoices, as the scan takes a long time. But I&#x27;m hoping to track individual receipts in an integrated manner. (I&#x27;d be willing to release part/all of this tool once I get this integration going, it needs some tuning and updating to be fully not-just-me ready).
 Suggestions or helpful advice appreciated, thanks!

                              <span>Hoping someone can help out. I have a docker server on windows 11 and I am having issues with WSL randomly crashing or something and losing access to my containers. They are all behind a reverse proxy using a cloudflare tunnel. Anytime it happens all I have to do is run wsl —shutdown from a command prompt and I regain access. But then after a random amount of time it seems I can’t access them and I get the cloudflare error page. I can’t access them locally either with my ip. None of the containers go down and I don’t even know where to look for logs to see if anything is erroring within the kernel. I have tried reinstalling docker and removing wsl feature from windows and re enabling and it still does it. I’ve also looked at the GitHub for wsl and it seems maybe others are having this issue but I can’t find a fix that works for me.

                              <span>Going through the process of building and obviously have my homelab in the forefront of my mind. I ran several ethernet runs in my current home for ubiquiti access points and cameras, as well as a few to our office + family room /tv area. I’m incredibly stoked to be able to run cable without having to crawl in the attic. 
 Any big tips or things to be mindful of while I have access to the wall cavities?
 So many posts suggest running 3-4 cables per room, is it really necessary?
 My lab:
 • Ubiquiti UDM Pro
 • Ubiquiti 16 Poe switch
 • Ubiquiti 10gb aggregation switch
 • Unraid box (super micro 36 bay)
 • Truenas box (also super micro 36 bay)
 • UPS

                              <span>I hope this isn&#x27;t against the rules, and I am not soliciting... but I am looking for advice on how/where to post a job opening.
 I&#x27;m looking for someone to manage a 75 node network that supports a staff of 15. It&#x27;s got everything from Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, ESXi, Proxmox, Docker, Ubiquiti, MySQL, and Synology, and in-house built apps. Most of the hardware consists of custom build workstations and servers. We have very little that runs in the Cloud. 
 I&#x27;ve been a longtime lurker in /r/homelab. I built most of this myself and many of the ideas have come from this group. I&#x27;m just at the point now where I need someone to take it over full time. 
 The whole lab is accessed remotely by the staff and I need someone who can be there hands on to manage and document it all. Make sure things are backed up, fix/repair broken hardware, do reboots, upgrade/build new workstations as things age, install new software and keep things patched/secure and running. They also need to be organized enough to manage a large volume of data coming in and out of the office on a weekly basis.
 I&#x27;ve posted variations of this to a bunch of job sites and have gotten over 100 resumes to sift through. After a dozen phone screens, no one is coming even close. 
 Most resumes are from people who are Tier 1 Helpdesk who do password resets, break fix, and some basic administration; but no one has ever installed anything from scratch. Only 1-2 people have ever built their own computer or know much about hardware, and no one seems to have any experience in Linux or Docker. Not a single resume has highlighted any Homelab experience.
 So, my question is:
 Where do you people look for jobs? Am I asking for too much? Is the job not attractive because it&#x27;s not Cloud based? Could there be something horribly wrong with my job description?
 Any advice that can point me in the right direction would be appreciated.

They both individually work when inserted in the network, but when they are both are next to each other in the network, there is no connection between them, even with both in un-mannaged mode.
 I&#x27;m wanting the prosafe+ next to the ISP drop, and the power connect lab side. Anyone got any ideas i can try, to figure out what&#x27;s happening?

                              <span>I have a powerful host with huge cpu/memory. I would like to run different types of VM on top of it. So I can switch environment conveniently for different purposes(dev zone, windows VM, side project, etc).
 I currently create a virtual bridge on bare metal host. The KVM VM connects to this bridge to get same IP range as bare metal host.
 Things overall look good but I occasionally run into weird issue such as not able to ssh to VM from outside world. Wondering whether my homelab&#x27;s overall design is correct.

                              <span>At one time, you could just startup an SMTP server and have at it.
 Nowadays though there&#x27;s (obvious) reasons to not allow just anyone to stick an SMTP server on the Internet, even if it&#x27;s a send-only server and it&#x27;s behind a firewall so nobody ever connects to it but you. While you can do this, pretty much any legitimate E-mail service out there will immediately flag anything you try sending as spam, or outright refuse to accept your messages in the first place.
 There&#x27;s a lot of reasons you might want to be able to deliver arbitrary E-mails - not just to yourself, but to others, possibly across disparate E-mail domains. The vast majority of such messages need not ever be replied to, so even the E-mail address they come from is not necessarily that important, other than that it should be able to be identified by the recipient.
 Are there services out there that are generally trusted to be able to do this, even if for a modest cost? Basically I want to be able to have a reliable way to send both myself and others who are relevant various alerts and messages.
 Examples:
  
I want errors found on ZFS with zed to go to me and a friend,
 I want to design an app that can E-mail a small number of people when I post new content on my Jellyfin server
 I want to have a script send a daily report of some server stats to me.
 I want to have a Web app where a person with an account in my system can submit some kind of job, and when the job has finished an E-mail is sent to the account&#x27;s stored E-mail address with the results of the job.
  
I know that if I were to just, say, create a Gmail account for the purpose, I could configure my apps to connect to Gmail&#x27;s SMTP and deliver that way, but I&#x27;m not sure Google even allows this type of use in the TOS, and even if that&#x27;s not a concern, it&#x27;s likely not going to make you look very good when all your E-mail account is doing is sending out obviously auto-generated E-mails on a regular basis.
 How do you guys handle this?

                              <span>I have been tinkering with hardware quite a bit – but some things remain mysteries to me and I finally dare to ask those questions in public. Been trying to read up on them online, but some information is scattered and inconsistent.
  
Are SAS hard drives worth it? From what I know internally they&#x27;re the same as SATA drives and have a physical limit at around ~200 MB/s throughput.
 Why specify SAS&#x27; hard drive connections as 6G/12G if throughput is limited to ~200 MB/s anyways?
 SFF-8087 and SFF-8643 are apparently the same electronically, just another physical connector. Is there any difference and can I just use adapters to go from one to the other without performance loss?
 Is there any real world difference between SAS2 6G and SAS3 12G backplanes? From what I understand each SFF-8xxx cable running to the backplane will get one dedicated 6G/12G connection. So serving four drives each that would mean 1,5 Gbps throughput per drive when working with SAS2 6G, right?
 Aren&#x27;t HBAs limited to 6G anyways? So why even bother with 12G backplanes?
 How do SAS expanders work and what&#x27;s the performance? This Dell SAS expander seems to expand to 24 drives and connects to another server for JBOD via a single SFF-8088. Do I get 6G/12G for all 24 drives or what&#x27;s the best way to connect a full array of hard drives without sacrificing performance?
 How do top loaders like 45Drives or Supermicro&#x27;s 90 drive top loader serve all of the disks? Do they just have 22 HBAs? How do they ensure full performance?
 I assume SAS3 12G is relevant for faster flash storage – but why is it still relevant when everyone talking about NVMes for best performance nowadays?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a little homelab, which I diagrammed the relevant part here https://i.imgur.com/2dtMFXK.png
 Basically I have an ESXI on my server, which hosts a Linux VM with an Apache web server. I can access my Apache without any problem, the problem begins when I want to access my ESXI web interface from the outside. ESXI has its own web server, but my router/firewall is configured to send incoming 80 and 443 to my Apache IP.
 I&#x27;m not sure of what would be the way to direct for instance esxi.mydomain.com to the ESXI web server. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I live in the middle of nowhere, only place I can post ads that I know of are facebook marketplace, but there&#x27;s very few people that would be interested in homelab gears.
 I got stuff like an UDM-Pro brand new still in the sealed box, or a used mikrotik switch, that I want to sell, but I don&#x27;t have an ebay account, and I&#x27;m a bit worried about selling on ebay since their policy tends to overly favor the buyer. 
 Thanks for any advices!

 I need a home firewall to protect my children. I believe my old HP Z400 desktop can serve this function. I would appreciate any recommendations for free firewall software that I can put on it.
 Thanks.

 A good notes app with the ability to schedule notes for a particular day and simple checklist support.

 How do I choose where to host which services so I use my resources as efficiently as possible?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can&#x27;t figure this problem out.
 So I want to use NginxProxyManager but don&#x27;t want it publicly accessible. I read I should only access it on localhost then, after connecting to the server via Wireguard, but it isn&#x27;t working for me.
 My Docker configuration for Wireguard is this, for NginxProxyManager it&#x27;s this, and my firewall looks like this.
 After deploying Wireguard, I copied the peer config and loaded it into the Wireguard app on my computer without issue.
 But when I connect to it, I can&#x27;t search on Google, or even access the port 81 that I wanted to (http://localhost:81) in the first place.
 I even tried curl-ing the address. On my server it&#x27;s fine and I get a response, but when I do it from my computer it just says &#x27;connection refused&#x27;.
 Anyone have any hints or ideas on how to fix this?
 I tried adding my IP to my firewall with sudo ufw allow proto tcp from my-ip to 80,443 or something, but it didn&#x27;t work. I also tried disabling my firewall and then accessing http://localhost:81 on my computer, but that was unsuccessful too.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m actually searching for the fastest media server solution.I&#x27;m currently running plex on my home server, and it works fine.Tho I have a backup with all my media on the cloud and I would like to make it as fast as possible.I tried:- plex, cool but slow if used on web- jellyfish good but still a little bit slow- emby wich for now is what I&#x27;m sticking to.
 Everything works with medias from a rclone mounted drive, network speed is not a problem so... what would you suggest?
 EDIT:
 Compromising on some features is not a problem, I just want the fastest way possible

                              <span>Hi everyone! Just shipped a product called Gardens: https://joingardens.com/apps. 📷
 PaaS (platform-as-a-service) refers to a model where the service helps you provision and run a platform for hosting apps and/or apps themselves without the hassle usually associated with it.
 New PaaS solutions show up pretty often, but they&#x27;re either proprietary, lock you in, or aren&#x27;t friendly for non-developers.Gardens solves all of that. Here&#x27;s what it does:
  - Makes setting up your own PaaS with an admin panel and setting up apps easy as cake. You don&#x27;t need to know how to code; there&#x27;s a library of 130+ apps available. They&#x27;re set up in one click
  - Does not lock you in. Your data as well as the PaaS application itself (Caprover) stays in your cloud. We support DigitalOcean but will add more providers soon
 - Has social features. While the whole self-hosting infra stays on your cloud, the main site features step-by-step guides and posts from big open-source companies to help find and share knowledge
 Curious to hear what the community here thinks! Gardens is open-source on Github, and accepting feature requests. Hope you&#x27;ll like it!

 And by txt2img I would expect you feed our an image and it tells you in text what it sees and where.
 As for txt2txt you would feed it a book, chapter, paragraph or sentence and it gives you a single word, sentence or résumé paragraph about the text. 
 Maybe you could zoom out of the whole text and apply these résumé as large colored transparent text overlay over the relevant pages so you can get a bird&#x27;s eye view of an entire text and be able to drill down on areas of interest.
 I&#x27;ve seen the Reddit news article summary bot so I know this exists in some capacity. I&#x27;m just hoping to find a self hosted, generalized version of this ?

 Is anyone aware of an self hosted Hazel alternative. Preferably on Docker, but I don&#x27;t mind installing it on a separate VM.
 Thanks so much!

It&#x27;s pretty sweet, but nobody has made a self-hosted gallery for the images and their prompts/settings... Yet plenty of online options exist.. https://lexica.art/, https://www.krea.ai/, etc
 What a conundrum! Who wants to be cool and be the first?

Do they open the SSO login in a browser ? Do they work at all if the service is behind SSO.
 The apps could be nextcloud, navidrome, jellyfin, immich etc.
 (Note: I am using SSO as a blanket term for user authentication)

 I&#x27;ve got some resource hungry containers that I do NOT need running all the time. Is there a means to launch docker containers on demand outside of launching portainer or some such, ideally via a web interface or link. My infrastructure is NOT hosted on the internet, so security is of slightly-less concern. Just curious if it is possible more than anything.
 Or, can I somehow pass a command via a web interface/button to portainer to start/stop a specific container?

 ​
 For a while I&#x27;m using photo view https://github.com/photoview/photoview and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this gallery, but sometimes I want delete or move an Album, and I need to use (https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser) for move or change file names or Album names or Albums directory. 
 ​
 Can you advise me some software with similar structure like photo view( I mean structure and gallery and album structure also, I don&#x27;t need face recognition) ?

                              <span>Hi All,
 As the title suggests, I&#x27;m looking for an alternative for Nginx Proxy Manager. My reasoning for this is I&#x27;ve been using Nginx Proxy Manager for the last 6 months or so, and in that time, I&#x27;ve had multiple instances of it just.. Failing outright. The docker container will be running, but traffic will not flow whatsoever. I&#x27;ve also had issues with SSL certs not renewing, as well as not issuing. I can&#x27;t keep having my services go down and reverting backups on the main server, rebuilding the container, or having to roll back updates/push new updates constantly to try and fix the problem.
 Recently, I had it fail again, and am unable to get it working whatsoever. I switched back to good old Nginx basic, writing the configs manually and setting it up, and it works fine.
 I&#x27;m looking for an alternative with a GUI. I don&#x27;t want to go back to command line and writing configs manually. I&#x27;m just too tired of having to pray that Nginx Proxy Manager will work, or having to roll back to get it working again.
 Please suggest some alternatives with a GUI and ideally docker based as I&#x27;m running this on a Windows machine.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I came across this subreddit and asked myself the following question. Suppose you want to host e.g. a Nextcloud, Bitwarden, etc. on your own server but have no idea about setting up the infrastructure. Is there a tool (or even a paid service) with which you can deploy the application (+ web server and so on) on your host with just a few clicks without necessarily depending on a provider? All this without additional software and via a frontend that guides me through the necessary steps?
 ​
 I am well aware that you have to take care of the connection from the tool to my host for example. My question is only aimed at the pure deployment or setup of the application.
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

 but i want to mess with self hosted password managers and 2FA for all of my services as well and both of these require https (so SSL) 
 so is there a way to set custom domains on my local network ( which i have done once through adguardhome) and then getting SSL certs for those domains ??

                              <span>Hello r/selfhosted community!
 For the context, in case you have seen it before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers. The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users&#x27; contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What&#x27;s new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.

                              <span>Hi guys.
 Currently Iran is blocking the internet mostly, and are trying to do what north korea and china do with their &quot;internet&quot;
 Almost no vpn works, only tor with snowflake connects which is so slow you can only send a text every 30seconds.
 Right now the only thing that I think is working properly are proxies, I don&#x27;t know much about proxies but some mtproto and socks5 proxies are working on my telegram (they get blocked after a while but we&#x27;ll use a new one)
 Can you guys provide some guides on how to use proxies for my whole linux and android device, and provide a list of proxies?
 Also a huge thanks to everyone who is sending us their help and prayers.

                              <span>I live somewhere with very restrictive internet censorship. Google DNS, Cloudflare and other well known dns providers are blocked and DNS requests are forwarded to a government resolver no matter what you set on your device. DoH (such as dns.google) doesn&#x27;t work at all. 
 Is there an easy, noob-friendly way i can host my own dns on a vps overseas?

                              <span>I really enjoy watching the cameras that are on windy.com. I was wondering how one would go about downloading a live feed from the site that are just a static image that refreshes every 3 seconds? An example of a stream: http://221.189.0.181/cgi-bin/guestimage.html. 
 I&#x27;ve tried Jdownloader2 but it only grabs the current image that is up. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll need something that refreshes or waits and pulls again? Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hello
 I want to build my own server, and I want to build de pc myself
 The use is going to be: 
 1) Automate media gathering: Radarr + sonarr + prowlarr + notifiarr + maybe 2 or 3 more *arrs. + Qbittorrent 
 2) Plex media server with tone mapping (normally for one user. Maximum 2 users at the same time) I need it to be running in Linux or Docker for compatibility (https://support.plex.tv/articles/hdr-to-sdr-tone-mapping/) as I need the tone mapping to be done with hardware and not software 
 3) Home assistant server 
 4) Backup server
 Could you advice me??
 Thank you!

                              <span>Right now I do my cloud backup to Google Drive Enterprise or whatever it is called these days, and while it works, it has some significant drawbacks. Mainly, it is limited to 750GB upload per day and could go away or not become unlimited at any time. I would like to switch to something more stable where it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m just freeloading off of an accounting oversight.
 Given the similar nature of most hoards (ripped blu-rays, youtube archives, linux ISOs, etc), it seems like there should be a way to share backup of a given collection with others, deduplicating and splitting the cost in the process. With B2 and Cloudflare for example, you could do this very cheaply.
 Does any such thing exist? Would you use it if it did?

                              <span>Hello, 
 Just a question.
 For the past few years while I was studying at the art academy I&#x27;ve been hoarding stuff from public computers people kept around. Best example: we had a scanner classroom with a dozen different scanners for digitalizing film photography and such. People often didn&#x27;t delete the stuff from the computers after they were done and I collected them. 
 Now I want to start an art project with all these collected files, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is allowed. I know from some of them who it was, but most of the time people didn&#x27;t really add names to their files. I probably can ask the ones that did add their name for permission. But is that even necessary?
 It was stored on public computers, there were no rules about the usage of it all. 
 I also recall artist Sherrie Levine who blatantly copied work of great artists such as Evan Walker, Edgar Degas and Marcel Duchamp. Without asking their permission of course. 
 This might be the wrong sub to ask this, but someone might be able to help me out here.

Are there any working tiktok scrapers which you have found or created? I have tried few which didn&#x27;t work. I know tiktok is a big firm and they have made scraping difficult but are there any tools which work?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I need some advice on where to go in my data hoarding/collecting. I currently have a DS214 that I&#x27;ve outgrown with 2 10tb drives in SHR-1 (RAID1). My main use for it is storing photos and videos for my photography work. I&#x27;m not accessing the data all the time but typically 1-2 days a week locally only. I&#x27;d like to eventually scale this more to increase storage and have a better 3-2-1 plan since, obviously, RAID isn&#x27;t backup. I&#x27;m thinking of using B2 eventually, but I need to solve the local issue first. I have an older (2014 era) custom PC that I can repurpose but am not sure what direction to move in. I would like a better and faster workflow for accessing my photos and I’m working mainly from my Mac currently via the DS214.

                              <span>I am open to Linux or Windows. I have DVD ISOs of TV shows and want to extract episodes as separate mp4 files and of course transcode to them. I don&#x27;t expect the tool to give me reasonable file names or episode names but if it did that would be super cool.
 Aiseesoft used to have a dvd ripper program that seemed to work ok but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be on their current product list and their new products seem crazy and complicated.

                              <span>Hi. Below are two links to a retailer in my country that sells two IronWolf drives. I&#x27;m a little confused, though. What&#x27;s the actual difference between the drives? They have the same name, but the price is different (though the actual difference is negligible - only about the equivalent of 4-5 USD). One has higher RPM but lower read and write speed, plus smaller cache. The other drive is the opposite - lower RPM with higher read and write speed and bigger cache. Also, the first drive is a little heavier. Does anybody know what&#x27;s up with that?
 Drive 1: here 
 Drive 2: here

 I&#x27;ve heard there is a way to get Dropbox Business Advanced for a bit cheaper. Who can help me with this? I do like to get the plan, but 3 users is too much for me and the price for the plan (when getting a license for 3 users) is too high compared to what Google offered with their Enterprise plan and my budget.
 Thanks!

                              <span>EDIT: [SOLVED, LEAVING UP FOR POSTERITY]
 Hi everyone. 
 Basically I would like to export every reddit comment that I have ever made.
 I have always wanted to write a book, and while most shit I have written on here is drivel, in the six years I&#x27;ve had this account (12 year vet of reddit here) I have experienced and written on the subjects of pandemia, the war in Ukraine, changing economic and social climate in Poland, France, and the United states, art, literature, music; you know, some occasionally good or interesting things.
 I also believe that the observer effect and known intent of wanting to write would, if I revisit these topics, strip away some of the eloquence, grandeur, or rawness from when I originally passionately wrote on these subjects in participation instead of intent to create a larger body of work. 
 So, I would like to export my reddit comments into .txt or something (is epub easy to set up I&#x27;ve no experience with this format but I suspect it would open up some tools to me, please correct me if I am out of date, I deal more in audio and graphics.)
 So, if anyone has any advice, I had performed my due diligence and tried to find things on my own, but so far I haven&#x27;t turned up anything due to build in limits to reddit that only catalogue the last 1k comments.
 Any help appreciated.

                              <span>Hi guys I just bought Godzilla (2014) on blu ray and ripped it using makemkv. The thing is that the file was 27GB and I thought it should be more, so when I played the movie in VLC it didn&#x27;t look as detailed as it should. I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong, I would like you to help me with that with some advice. My only goal is to have a remux file of the movie.
 PS: I leave you an image of the drive with I used
 PS 2: I have two screenshots, as you can see in the 3D Bluray version Godzilla&#x27;s scales are very clear but not in the standard Bluray version. The same goes for other scenes where in the Bluray 3D version everything is more detailed. https://imgur.com/a/Z5hUjbU

 Would there be any other way or fix that&#x27;ll allow me to view these videos through the Wayback Machine? Please and thank you

                              <span>I am managing folder structures for our team&#x27;s information. It&#x27;s in sharepoint, but practically-speaking, everyone accesses it by syncing to OneDrive and navigating through File Explorer. 
 I am constantly getting suggestions to deepen folder structures, to provide more organisation. I want to better understand the pros and cons of this. I would like to say No, because I think users will have more clicking, not necessarily guaranteeing the data hoard is properly filed. But that just sounds like a negative Nancy / pessimistic response.
 Advice?

                              <span>I’m very uninformed and uneducated on this subject, please bear with me.
 When I search for what HDD should I buy, results mostly said I should buy cheap one, but multiple.
 They also talked about bytes per dollar rule and something but, I honestly forgot.
 So…I’m here to asking direct help, again.
 I’m planning to get Terra Master D5-300C DAS, and I use it for storing huge video and image files. Nothing crazy, casual use, I think. Don’t sure if it’s helpful for you to give me advice.

                              <span>I have been using RaiDrive 2020.6.80 (I use this old version because new ones require payment for the shared drives connection) to connect my main Google Drive enterprise, and also my shared drives. Today, the shared drives do not connect, and it just tells me: Delegation aborted Reason: () GoogleTeamDrive: https://lambda.raidrive.com/v1.1/cloud/GoogleTeamDrive/access_token -&gt;(BadRequest)
 My main enterprise drive still works. But the shared drives not. Also heard from my two people I have given access to shared drives, and set up the same RaiDrive system.
 Anyone else noticed? Could they have “fixed” their loophole of using an old version? Or maybe just a temporary glitch?…
 EDIT: Well for now I switched to using the Google Drive client on those machines aswell. But shame if RaiDrive stopped working.

I am looking for the best way to accomplish this goal. Can you advice me on which data storage should I choose for this task? Right now I am planning on using Google Drive, but there are propably better options.

Google of goharddrive code gets plenty of hits from weird sites, but nothing works. I have signed up for email, and this isn&#x27;t something I need to do asap, but no need to wait if they are never going to show up. 
 Anybody know for sure? What I have read a few places is that you get a code for first purchase.

                              <span>I’m in the process of upcycling some of my old hardware into a basic server (NAS and some very lightweight VMs) but I have an issue ; I only have one PCIe x16 slot, and only 2x SATA III ports, and 2x SATA II. I’m using an SSD for a boot drive and I have 3x 6TB drives. Is it more worth it to add more SATA ports with the PCIe slot and an expansion card or do I use the slot for a low/mid-tier GPU I have (1060 3gb)? Not sure what would be more worth it. I would be using the GPU mainly for accelerated transcoding, but idk if it’s worth sacrificing the SATA speed on 2 of my hard drives.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been reading up on various file server options and would really appreciate the sub&#x27;s input.
 Current setup: Three-node Proxmox HA cluster. TrueNAS Core running virtualized on one Proxmox node with local HBA and disks passed through. Total file storage is only around 5TB.
 Problem: TrueNAS Core is overkill for my current needs. The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can&#x27;t take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.
 I&#x27;d like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I&#x27;m looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn&#x27;t support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data. I&#x27;ve looked at openmediavault, Unraid, Ubuntu server, and stripped-down TrueNAS with a virtualized disk - but can&#x27;t figure out which path to pursue. 
 Hoping someone has been down a similar road and can offer advice. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi community,
 tldr at the bottom. 
 Long time lurker here. I was dreaming about a homelab for some time and a few months ago I made the first baby step and bought a Synology DS920+ to have a NAS in general and have a place where I can play around a bit with docker containers to see whether I really like this hobby or not.
 I spent at least a dozen night since having the NAS playing around with my home sandbox to say the least and really like the whole host things for yourself and build a mini &quot;empire&quot; locally. Anyway a long lost child is on the surface again and I enjoy it.
 So the other day an electrician were over to do some job here and he is a very cool guy and we have talked a lot about homelab stuff and he said that he has some old servers which he just happened to have because he l…</span>

                              <span>I posted this in r/WireGuard as well, but since r/homelab has a larger membership, I thought I&#x27;d see if any of you had any ideas.....
 Ok, so, I have a number of issues trying to keep things running on my external access to my hosted services in my home. All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I&#x27;ve been doing this for YEARS, but I&#x27;ve been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. 
 All that to ask this....I&#x27;ve been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.
 I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.
 That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I&#x27;ll just use my existing configs for it, but what I&#x27;m NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it&#x27;s just using OpenVPN, but I&#x27;m not sure).
 Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?
 Ultimately, I&#x27;d like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don&#x27;t limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode&#x27;s IP my public IP.
 Although, now that I&#x27;m thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).
 Am I making this too complicated? LOL!
 Any help or thoughts would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am currently running a dell r720 with all 8 2&quot;5in drive bay filled. I have recently procured 8x 3&quot;5in 4TB SAS drives and was hoping I could get some ideas on how to connect them to the server as I would like to use them. I am using Truenas Scale if it helps. Thanks

                              <span>I could not figure out how to answer about the T620 Fan Gantry Question in a way it would let me post pictures. 
 I can confirm that the fan Gantry from a T630 / T640 can be adapted to the T620. I ordered the Gantry from eBay that was for a T630/T640 and I had the fans from a T620 (same fan type that is in the CPU Shroud Assembly) - The only thing I had to do is snip the small metal piece blocking the Fan connectors to go down.

 Use Tin Snips to cut that piece out and Use Needle Nose Pliers to bend the edges back down.

                              <span>I recently got a server rack and a Chieftec UNC-410S 4U case and RSR-260 rack rails. Since the manual is not helping much I&#x27;m wondering if I&#x27;ve mounted them correctly. There is a gap in the front when sliding in the case cause of the way the rail is mounted, which does not allow me to fasten the case to the rack in the front, is this normal and secure or should I mount the rack rail further back(1st img)?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I currently have a HP Z820 Workstation with 128GB RAM and some SSD drives. CPU &#x3D; Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v2 @ 3.30GHz (2 Sockets). It runs great, but I am selling it as it uses too much power. About 111 watts to 200 watts depending on what it&#x27;s doing.
 My Goals:
  
Save on my electrical bill (less watts the better) 
 Have a small foot print (Z820 is a beast) 3)Have the power I need
  
I&#x27;m looking at 1 of 2 options:
  
Buy an Intel NUC NUC12WSHi5 and place on a shelf in my 18U rack 
 Build a custom Micro ATX system and place it in a Rosewill 2U chassis to fit in my 18U rack
  
Intel NUC Build: 
  
NUC12WSHi5 - $525 
 64GB RAM - $150 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 1TB SSD (Own already) 
 SABRENT 512GB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2242 - $70
  
Micro ATX Build: 
  
ASRock B660M-HDV LGA 1700 Intel B660 SATA 6Gb/s DDR4 Micro ATX Motherboard - $89 
 Rosewill RSV-Z2700U 2U Server Chassis Rackmount Case - $155
 Intel Core i5-12600 - Core i5 12th Gen Alder Lake 6-Core 3.3 GHz LGA 1700 65W Intel UHD Graphics 770 Desktop Processor - BX8071512600 - $230 
 be quiet! SHADOW ROCK LP - $86 
 be quiet! Pure Wings 2, 80mm Fan - $9 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 6TB Mech. HDD - Own 
 500GB or 1TB SSD - Own 
 1TB or 2TB Mech/SSD for Emby? - Own
 Antec Earthwatts Gold Pro Series EA650G Pro 650W Semi-Modular, 80 PLUS GOLD - $99 
 Crucial 64GB Kit (2 x 32GB) DDR4-3200 UDIMM - $165
  
I believe that the NUC will use around 45 watts~ but am not sure about the other build, I know it&#x27;s dependent on work load but any guess as to how much power it&#x27;ll use?
 Here&#x27;s what I do with Proxmox, at the moment:
  
5 out of the 20 VMs run most of the time, the remainders are just for testing, learning, etc. 
 I run a lot of containers, Linux OS&#x27;s and a couple of Windows OS&#x27;s 
 The containers are small, mostly web servers, the most intensive ones are TrueNAS and Emby
  
I will have to put a couple hundred into either build after I make the sale on the tower. Thoughts? Advise?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently playing around with a Ubuntu VM on a Dell R530. I&#x27;ve got my media server setup (docker/Radarr/SabNZB/Plex/Medusa/Heimdall/Diun)
 Are there any other &#x27;fun&#x27; apps I can install/make use of?
 Very new to the Docker world so not sure what is currently out there

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I am looking for a solution to basically do a NMAP scan every 15-30 minutes on my network and either alert me of new devices or show me the new devices. Same as doing port and host monitoring. 
 Im not sure if librenms will do this for me but i can look into it. 
 Goal:
  
notification of new devices
 web ui
 port mapping
 latency testing
 non-credentialed scans/ credentialed scans
  
Any ideas would be great!

                              <span>Made this to get some inspiration (and hopefully help others in the same boat as me). 
 My current set up consists of a TrueNAS server with ~8TB usable storage and a Plex VM running inside of it, a Raspberry Pi with a VPN server and PiHole installed, and a Dell Optiplex micropc running Docker which currently has Zabbix and Portainer running on it - I definitely plan on upgrading soon, but as the title suggests, I’m looking for some ideas on what else I would like to run.
 Some ideas for the future: Graphana; some sort of camera managing software for a future security system (found an open source option which looks great but can’t remember the name off the top of my head) and a backup solution that would backup servers to TrueNAS.
 Anyway, what are you people in this subreddit running currently and is there anything you would suggest I take a look at?

                              <span>I am trying to figure out how to manage access for internal servers running various web apps. (It is important to note that neither these apps nor servers are exposed to the public Internet.) In the past, I have relied on unsigned certificates or even no certificates. However, I am starting to see apps that will not work in either of these configurations and web browsers that are becoming increasingly unhappy about unsigned certificates.
 I get that there are risks with unsigned certs, but these are tightly controlled apps inside my LAN and so I am less concerned. I am familiar with letsencrypt and use that for external facing apps. But all of these servers are internal only and so an external CA makes little sense.
 Any advice on how to handle this?
 TIA!

                              <span>I put Linux on an old machine and I&#x27;ve been learning to work it for the past month. I&#x27;ve ran into issues trying to install a vpn along side pihole and was wondering if anyone had any guides/fixes/ideas?
 I had the machine running pi-hole via docker, it broke a few times, I fixed it a few times, but I&#x27;m feeling more confident in my skills. I&#x27;ve been trying to get a vpn to go with it, but I&#x27;m running into issues. First I thought I would give mistborn a try and I ran into issues. Recently I&#x27;ve been messing with wirehole and opened an issue thread without any luck. Should I stop trying to use things in docker? Is there something different I should be doing? Any help is appreciated

                              <span>Hello all, I’m looking for an application (preferably docker) that is able to generate a task completion report in PDF format that can be sent to the user via SMTP or can be viewed via a web portal. 
 This app is to prevent any disputes between me and the users during project discussions and on-site communications (e.g. on what user has requested and how they want the task to be done, signed at the end of the day and a report is generated for recording purposes.)
 The report itself needs to have the following information: - Unique running numbers to keep track of the report, something similar to an invoice. - A table that allows me to input the tasks that has been completed. - A signature line for user to sign. - Date &amp; time of task completion in the report.

 Also, is there anything which can recommend me songs based on my playlist(s)?

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to self host a tailscale alternative.. (or similar).
 I&#x27;ve seen a lot of the recommendations but most of them need a fair bit of investment to get them working so i;d like to ask some advice as to which one to sink my time in to..
 What I have : 
  
A VPS with 3x vCPU Core, 25GB SSD RAID-10, 2GB RAM, 3000GB Traffic - 1Gbps Port,1 Dedicated IPv4 Address
 2 Proxmox hosts locally
  
What i&#x27;d like : 
 Edit : A web gui!! i need a web gui to administer things!
 A VPN that will allow me to connect in via the VPS (ideally) and access my entire local network. Routinely, i&#x27;d be taking down one of my proxmox hosts, so i&#x27;d like to host a subnet router or similar on each one so there are failovers should i take one down..
 the VPS should also be able to ping my entire local network (for uptime kuma)
 I&#x27;d also like another subnet router for another remote network on a different IP range..
 Tailscale does everything i want on the free tier.. except for having 3 ingress(?) points in to my home network... if i&#x27;m not using the correct terminology here or anything else is off.. please tell me..
 Edit : looking at the tailscale documentation they offer a beta feature at the business class level called &quot;subnet router failover&quot; this is pretty much exactly what i&#x27;m after.. but you know.. selfhosted and free :)

 Do You thinks if I make a 4TB LXC Container with tnycore fileserver (samba ) and give it a Local IP , then Share it as a network NAS to my Dockers VM on the same Proxmox server is a Good idea ?

                              <span>Connections and connection groups disappear when added to a connection group but still exist somewhere behind the scenes. I made a connection group called “networking” under the Root folder but now anything that I add to the networking group just disappears. If I try to make another group under networking the same thing happens, it seems to add without error but then it is not there when I expand the networking group. If I try to make the group again it says the group already exists. 
 Any ideas of what to check? 
 Also does anyone link directly to guacamole sessions? Im hoping to integrate with zabbix using macros to link hosts to a guac connection such as https://guac.my.tld/#/client/{HOST.IP} but it seems like guac uses auto generated strings for the url. Anyone doing something similar?

                              <span>Initially when i started my project, i planned to make my setups secure. My threat-model is probably quite low, as i am the only one using it and don&#x27;t publicize anything.
 Despite that, i still wanted to opt for a secure setup balancing my technical knowledge and skills, and practical usage.
 Before i started this all, i read up on what other people did and my &#x27;conclusion&#x27; was &quot;yeah, i should do that too because that seems right&quot;. But lately i am pondering if i should.
 I&#x27;ve created a DMZ network and installed a Treafik Proxy server within it. This proxy will redirect request to the actual application. I&#x27;ve already setup my firewall rules (only allows 80/443, and proxy to my app), the application (on a different VLAN) and even secured the docker socket.
 My next step was to add MFA like A…</span>

 Something with a calendar for appointments and who has him what day?
 The ability to upload pictures would be great; something to hold pictures of health cards, passport, insurance info, etc.
 Any thoughts on the matter would be greatly appreciated.

 Pretty much as the title say, I&#x27;m curious if anybody is self-hosting this? 
 If so, have you followed the guide to open all the required ports
 Open TCP ports 80, 443, 33073, 10000 (Dashboard HTTP &amp; HTTPS, Management gRCP &amp; HTTP APIs, Signal gRPC API respectively) on your server. 
 Or have you found some way to chuck a proxy in front of it?
 Thanks

                              <span>&quot;On October 26, 2022, the cost for .info registrations and renewals with Google Domains will increase from $12 to $22 per year. You can minimize the impact of the price change by adding up to 9 additional years to your current registration at only $12 per year.&quot;
 That seems like a big jump in price. I&#x27;d like to keep my .info domain, so I&#x27;m just wondering if there is a better alternative to Google Domains.
 (This is for my self-hosted stuff.)

                              <span>Greetings, I am searching for some chat solution that can work with SIP.
 How I imagine that is that you have one client where you can chat and where you also have some kind of dial pad to do sip calls.
 Sofar I wasn&#x27;t really able to find something that would work like this and the closest thing I found was the old jitsi desktop client which has XMPP and SIP in one application. Which would be perfect if only it wasn&#x27;t EOL and buggy

Would it have been scraped in that time? To fix it, I needed to restart it, which wiped out the docker access logs, so I can&#x27;t read them.
 Nay help would be appreciated, because I&#x27;m freaking out.

                              <span>Hi Everyone👋 , I&#x27;m one of the developers of ILLA, and I&#x27;m here to introduce our product here. We have many new features gonna be released by the end of Sep. 
 Our team members came from early-stage TikTok &amp; Kuaishou. We realized one huge issue during developing those products, operation and marketing teams need a tool to monitor data. It&#x27;s a very tedious job for developers. Therefore, we decided to build a low-code open-source tool to solve this. Our team believes our product is easy like Minecraft, but we definitely have more possibilities. You can even customize your own &quot;block&quot; in our product and sell it in the marketplace. (The feature is coming soon)
 ILLA is an open source low-code platform to help you to build internal tools in minutes. Alternative to PowerApps, AppSmith, and Retool. Check out our website to know more about us.

                              <span>Hello guys, quick question:
 I also want to use my knowledge and server power for good things. Reading about the developments and the cencorship in iran is devastating, but I stumbled across this tweet and this repo by signal to help people in iran get the word out.
 For the signal proxy, they are using nginx and letsencrypt already and the ports 80 and 443. My current setup already involves an nginx proxy as well as a certbot, so how can I host this signal proxy in my infrastructure?
 Some docker and nginx wizards are needed and the help is very welcome! Thanks 
 Edit: This is a blog post about the situation by signal

This is probably me being bad at things because I&#x27;ve been spoiled by LSIO containers, but I ran into trouble installing both of the ones I was able to find: https://github.com/Zuluru/Zuluru3#launch-zuluru and https://github.com/harisjlatif/doubleheader. Anyone here use these or have a recommendation? Thanks!

                              <span>So i was wondering which would be the best, 
 - divide de external drive in 2 partitions, one NTFS and the other HFS or 
 - Make it Ex-fat, but it dosnt have the journaling feature, so i dont know if it would be less stable to crash my backups in the future 
 Obs: Fat-32 is not a possibility, since i have files larger then 4gb 
 Thanks in advance !

                              <span>Hey guys, im new to data hoarding so forgive me if this is a dumb question.
 Recently, i got a hdd and decided to compile all the digital family photos we have from the past like 15 years and organize them so my mother can view them (she loves family photos). How can i rename all the files based on date created? Theres about 2tb of pictures and i dont want to go into the properties of each individual one to get the date it was taken and then rename them lol. Is there a way to rename them en masse?
 Edit: i should say rename by date modified, as the dates created are all recent since they were just created on this hdd. Date modified seems to be the day the photo was taken.

                              <span>So, 
 I own a QNAP TS-453D with these inside: 
 - 2 x WD red plus 4TB (WD40EFZX) drives in RAID 1 (39-40°C) 
 - 2 x WD black 1TB WD10JPLX drives in RAID 1 (34-36°C) - using these just becase they&#x27;re standing and doing nothing for the moment. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m going remove the WD Blacks and put another two 8TB drives in RAID 1. I&#x27;m considering one of these CMR drives: 
 ​
 WD Red Plus WD80EFZZ - 5640 rpm - warranty 3 years - 25/30 dbA - 255 € 
 WD Red Pro WD8003FFBX - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 29/36 dbA - 277 € 
 Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 - 7200 rpm - warranty 3 years - 28/32 dbA - 219 € 
 Seagate IronWolf Pro ST8000NE001 - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 28/30 dbA - 265 € 
 ​
 I&#x27;m using the NAS for two things only: 
  
Plex/Emby server 
 
PC / phone backup 
 
 ​
 The transfer speed right now is ~110Mb/s (1 Gbit link), which is good enough for me. 
 ​
 The price difference right now is not a deciding factor for me at all. But what matters for me more is: 
  
silence 
 
temperature 
 
longevity 
 
 ​
 The PRO&#x27;s (WD &amp; SG) both have 5 years of warranty - but, from the specs it would seem that it comes at the cost of drive noise (&amp; higher operating temperatures). 
 ​
 Any suggestions for my situation? &gt;&gt; I&#x27;d like to have a quiet (and not to warm) NAS that will be reliable for some time.

                              <span>I’ve been paying $60 for 1TB of Amazon Drive cloud storage to save mainly photos and videos totaling about 500GB.
 And having Amazon Photos is a nice since it easier to view photos there than on Drive.
 But Drive is shutting down and Photos by itself is no good because the one feature I need to have is the ability to bulk download in the event the service shuts down. I love that Drive has it.
 Does anyone know of any good alternatives that makes it convenient to bulk download in case of an emergency?

                              <span>Hello, I have found myself in a position where I need to archive several terabytes of data for long term storage and have begun to seek out an external LTO-5 tape drive since I read this was the start of encryption for LTO tapes as well and I feel encryption is important for the data.
 I really only have a modern windows 11 machine however, and my PCIe x8 slot is blocked by my GPU. I would really prefer not having to find a workaround for this.
 My question is, do PCIe x4 SAS HBA cards with the external ports exist? The LTO-5 drive I am looking to buy is a dual SAS one, so I assume I need one that has 2 external ports? I think that&#x27;s the kind of card I need, anyway. I am novice.
 I&#x27;ve of course tried to search on my own, but it&#x27;s difficult for a newcomer with lots of unrelated results.
 Thank you for your consideration.

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m looking to have a big amount of data, and I wonder what is the best solution for my case
 I pretend to have a machine running 24/7 as media server, with radarr and sonarr. It will also serve as Plex media server. The las function it will have, is going to be a home assistant server.
 I wonder if it is a good idea to invest in a mini server, a good nas, or what I&#x27;m thinking, a nuc with a nas connected through usbC
 The nuc is a nuc11i3, and I think that the most basic nas would do the job, as I only need it as storage. I want to do this because I need to do tone mapping.
 What is your opinion /advice?

                              <span>Years back, I built myself a 50TB server with ZFS and 2 redundant disks. Massive storage beyond my imagination. Of course I have adopted the hoarding ways and now starting to feel the limits.
 I bought a motherboard with a decent number of SATA ports and expanded it with a SAS controller (seemed like a pretty niche piece of hardware!).
 What are my options for further expansion? I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.
 Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this? When I look it up I find a bunch of synology expansions arrays.
 Sorry if this is a silly question, I don&#x27;t exactly know what I should be searching :).

                              <span>I have a r630 that I believed to have a bad motherboard. I then Purchased a r730xd and have the same exact issues. Ill run through my troubleshooting steps and maybe someone will see something Im missing.
 The issue is as follows, A1 and A3 show as bad memory channels.
  
swap A1 and A2, while swapping A3 and A4. still shows as bad memory in channels A1 and A3.
  
So this tells me that either the r630 motherboard or CPU1 is faulty. 
  
Swapped CPU1 and CPU2. Still shows as memory channels A1 and A3 are faulty.
  
So this tells me the motherboard is faulty.
  
Buy r730xd barebones and install my cpus, memory, hba, and nic. didn&#x27;t install in any order grabbed cpu and memory at random. Shows A1 and A3 faulty. repeated steps 1 and 2 with r730xd. Is it likely that I got 2 motherboards with faulty dimms slots/traced on the exact same dimms? I would lean to cpu but swapping them on both servers didnt move the error.

                              <span>So far my understanding is:
  
Pay for a line to be built (2mile road to nearest fiber conn) 
 
Continue paying for data which throttles at 150GB ($2/GB) 
 
Use my phone hotspot (which also throttles at 50GB) 
 
Rent office space? I can&#x27;t find any near me
 
 Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me. I start sweating when I see Slack or another JavaScript website download 20MB+. All those little things add up. Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. 
 I&#x27;ve considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I&#x27;m pretty sure cell towers are a bust. 
 The nearest library is nice but it&#x27;s only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. 
 Am I stuck with Starbucks? 
 I&#x27;m a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things. Anyone have any experience with rural internet conditions? How do you solve your data cap issues?

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;m upgrading my consumer level mobos to server grade and am looking for your experiences. I&#x27;m currently planning to get ASUS P12R-M/10G-2T for my pfSense router. Mainly due to that I&#x27;ve learned to trust Asus mobos, it&#x27;s got 2x Intel X710-AT2, ECC, IPMI, M.2 and is actually available. I&#x27;m likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I&#x27;m a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)
 - How&#x27;s the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I&#x27;m aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I&#x27;ll succeed with a 2U though.
 - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?
 - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense? I&#x27;ve got a separate 2x10GbE Intel PCIe NIC too.
 - Other gotchas that you wish you&#x27;d known before jumping to server boards?

                              <span>I am setting up a backup server and need some help dealing with the storage.
 Using XCP-NG as the hypervisor. I have 24TB of raw disks. I&#x27;d like to use this disk space mainly for the the backup, but would also like to have some space for other stuff.
 Should I:
  
Setup ZFS on XCP-ng and just give a large virtual disk to the backup VM?
 Setup ZFS on XCP-ng, and then create a NFS/iSCSI share to be mounted from the backup share?
 Setup TrueNAS and pass through the drives, then setup iSCSI or NFS for the connection to the backup VM
 Anything better that I might be missing?

 Found these m4 thumb screws on amazon for less than 10$ to space them out so heat will be dealt with better.

                              <span>Greetings,
 I have two APC R2000 Rack-Mount UPS&#x27;s for my HomeLab that appear to be completely dead. No output, no lit LED. Checked with known good batteries (from 3rd UPS). I&#x27;ve checked for (visibly) blown components, and confirmed that power makes it past the main circuit breaker.
 I&#x27;d like to find someone in the Boston/MA/US region that I can pay $$$ to repair. I can deliver and retrieve, they are too heavy to ship, so I&#x27;d like to find someone in the region.
 Thank you for any recommendations.

                              <span>I am running into and am too stupid to figure it out on my own. I&#x27;ve tried reading google, no one wants to dumb it down for me.
 Scenario: I have Ubuntu Desktop on VMware. I have multiple users for me and 2 friends so we can share the vm. I am installing xrdp so we can all remote in wherever we are (already have vpn up and running).
 We all use windows as our daily drivers because it&#x27;s easy and what we grew up on. We will all be using RDP to get in.
 It works fine on my account after enabling the remote desktop bs in settings. Cannot get it to work at all on the other accounts despite all of them having the same settings. 
 Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. Please educate me.

 Will this do the trick? My home PC is ALOT better, but im 2 years from an upgrade and I&#x27;m chomping at the bit to dabble with my pelco... any advice is appreciated. Total noob in pre planing stages. I have a decent amount of media id like access to throughout my house and perhaps a plex server. Movies and music. Is this enough or should I hold out? Thank you!

This was the listing image and matched what I received. hese cards look like they have a IBM server proprietary connector. Am I on the right track?

So would this be something good to add to my resume? Any feedback is appreciated. It&#x27;s a work in progress and is incomplete so far. One thing I can&#x27;t figure out is how to add a theme to the page, I would like it to be dark.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve mounted my homelab and it is working great! 
 The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I&#x27;m looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.
 I&#x27;ve got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they&#x27;re lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?

                              <span>I’m thinking of setting up a raidz array with eSATA. My current mobo only supports 6 Gb/s sata. It looks like eSATA maxes out at 6 as well. So I’m considering an external hard drive array case and run ZFS. Do you guys see that being problematic at all?

                              <span>I&#x27;m running a OPNsense on my proxmox host which serves as the gateway for all my VMs. The proxmox host is running on my LAN at home. My setup:
  
192.168.0.50 - my workstation which i use for daily stuff
 192.168.0.48 - proxmox host
 192.168.0.61 - opnsense gateway which is used to seperate my homelab from my LAN at home
 10.10.10.0/24 - my homelab network
  
If my dc is at e.g. 10.10.10.2/24 - what would be best way to configure the opnsense so that I could rdp into the dc from my workstation at 192.168.0.50?
 ​
 Looking forward to your suggestions, thanks!

                              <span>What are y&#x27;all running for a GPU for transcoding? Or anyone got one for sale? I have 1 stream and source files are 2160p which leads to video stutters every few seconds, so I&#x27;m thinking I should go the GPU transcoding route. I&#x27;m debating on running Plex along side jellyfin to see if jellyfin is the problem but I can&#x27;t imagine it would be.
 The server is in my basement so noise is not an issue.
 Edit: it&#x27;s a 1u server, whoops

                              <span>At home I have dual WAN. I have AT&amp;T Fiber and T-Mobile 5G Home Internet. The T-Mobile connection is CGNAT, so no inbound connections possible
 This is a problem for remote access as well as a service I use that needs to send webhooks to a local server. 
 I set up a Wireguard server on my VPS, setup a tunnel between my firewall at home (PFSENSE) and the VPS, and then I used nginx proxy manager &quot;Streams&quot; to forward the port I need for webhooks to the local host at home
 Now no matter what the internet is doing at home, it will always be able to connect through the tunnel and back to the server
 Now, I want to get a remote access VPN working. I have OpenVPN setup on PFSENSE which works very well for me. I figured I could just do the same and &quot;Stream&quot; 1194 back to the firewall, but it doesn&#x27;t connect. 
 Has anyone gotten this to work?
 I would just use Wireguard on the VPS, but the outbound internet in Linode is not great, a lot of services are blocked by third party companies from Linode IP&#x27;s, and the DNS config in OpenVPN is much better than Wireguard and everything in my home network &quot;Just works&quot; via OpenVPN, not so much with Wireguard

                              <span>Hi all
 There&#x27;s been alot of posts around hosting signal proxies to support Iran. My question is it going to really help? I want to help anyway I can and if a signal proxy will genuinely help I&#x27;ll do it, but iv read conflicting information saying VPNs are needed more. 
 I don&#x27;t know anyone in Iran so not sure I&#x27;d want to host a VPN for anyone to use.
 Interested in others thoughts on this?

 When I am on the tailscale network and I try browse to the service using the DNS entry in pihole, it won&#x27;t work. What am I missing?
  
I have setup Tailscale on my home server (running Ubuntu SE 22.04) and have advertised my docker network as a subnet

                              <span>Curious as to which way the modern wind is blowing. I have nginx setup natively (i.e. not in docker) due to some legacy stuff on my server. Without boring you all with the detail, it took me quite a while to get SSL working on a local intranet via nginx. I am tempted to migrate to a docker container of nginx or caddy, but what I have is also working.
 Who&#x27;s using what now a days? Caddy seems more... recent in its featureset and development. Is it easy enough to deploy?

 I created a home server to essentially replace and finally get rid of Google&#x27;s storage forever, and all was going so well until i realised I needed to constantly update my records with my current public IP since my public IP is dynamic.
 Well, when doing this, I found that Cloudflare blocked API use for my domain name, a .tk free domain, for unknown reasons (all i could find relating to this error on Google were just screams of help and no resolutions whatsoever) and now I&#x27;m just stuck here confused at how I can have my domain still running effectively without having it drop due to the ISP&#x27;s IP cycling.

                              <span>TL;DR
 I&#x27;m sharing a nice 1-line command that prints docker network name and it&#x27;s IP (Gateway&#x27;s IP strictly speaking). See below.
 ​
 Long version
 Problem: in AdguardHome I see all these IPs that are coming from docker containers. I&#x27;d like to see which containers. Turns out it&#x27;s not that straightforward to clearly see what container produces what network at which IP range. (at least not with a simple docker command).
 So, I went on a and wrote a lengthy nodejs script that would loop through docker networks finding these IPs and nicely print them for me.
 Then I realised that there must be an easier way.
 The Bash way.
 So here is the final version of a day&#x27;s work. Maybe it will help someone save the time :-)
 ​
 The command
 (echo &quot;NAME GATEWAY&quot;; docker network inspect $(docker network ls --format&#x3D;&quot;{{.ID}}&quot;) --format&#x3D;&quot;{{.Name}} {{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}&quot; 2&gt; /dev/null) | column -t -s &quot; &quot;

                              <span>All,
 After fighting with Plex and the Plex Service on a domain join windows computer, I&#x27;m needing opinions on a simple DLNA server that can run without any logins or user interactions. We&#x27;ve also had no luck with the built-in DNLA server that Windows 10 has.
 Does anyone have recommendations? I want to be able to reboot that computer on a schedule and still have the DNLA service run when the computer is back online.

                              <span>How do I use nginx proxy manager to tunnel a vikunja instance to my domain? This is my first time using npm, but every time i try to connect to the domain I set for vikunja, I get a 502 bad gateway error. I don&#x27;t think its a problem with the app itself, as if i connect with a direct IP, it runs as intended, but with whatever I have in NPM, it gives me the error. Both my vikunja and npm are in their own docker-compose.yml files, and they are bridged with a docker network. I tried using 127.0.0.1:PORT, localhost:PORT, and vikunja-frontend-1:PORT in the dashboard, but none worked.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Question for anyone who knows Wireguard.
 I have a VPS, it runs the docker container wg-easy, works great. At home I have a PFSENSE Firewall, I configured the wireguard tunnel with the VPS as the server, and I can get traffic over to the VPS via Wireguard with no problem, speeds are great
 My question is, how do I get the traffic to work the other way? Do I need to add some static routes?
 I read this guide:https://hacdias.com/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat
 That does not mention static routes, so I&#x27;m not sure how that exactly works.
 Second question would be, I see that in this guide there is PostUp and PostDown configurations for WireGuard, if I look at the conf for wg-easy, it only has PostUp. Do I need the PostDown?

 Using XCP-NG as the hypervisor. I have 24TB of raw disks. I&#x27;d like to use this disk space mainly for the the backup, but would also like to have some space for other stuff.
 Should I:
  
Setup ZFS on XCP-ng and just give a large virtual disk to the backup VM?
 Setup ZFS on XCP-ng, and then create a NFS/iSCSI share to be mounted from the backup share?
 Setup TrueNAS and pass through the drives, then setup iSCSI or NFS for the connection to the backup VM
 Anything better that I might be missing?

                              <span>Trying to get https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io working right. So I&#x27;m trying to keep me up to date on new free games from https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedeals/new.json?limit&#x3D;50 like this:
 https://i.imgur.com/6F4qFHo.png
 https://i.imgur.com/D0dJhvC.png
 But I&#x27;m not really getting the desired results. I&#x27;m getting notifications whenever anything new is posted there. Even if I put free and 100% in extracting text, I&#x27;d get like 3-4 lines with either 100% or free, which is correct, but when new stuff is posted this extracted 100% or free gets moved around and it triggers new notifications.
 What I really want is compare snapshot x(now) to y(old), if new line or new text with 100% or free appears AND is different to snapshot y THEN trigger.
 Not if it moves around, not if it&#x27;s the same as before.
 A current snapshot looks like that: https://i.imgur.com/bbC5d8q.png
 The diff looks like this and still triggers notifications: https://i.imgur.com/5xnNoQp.png, even though I have checked &quot;new lines&quot; and triggers set to new/100%, I guess moving the lines with &quot;new&quot; and &quot;100%&quot; equals &quot;new lines&quot; which is why it triggers.

                              <span>Hi all! First post in this awesome community. 
 I&#x27;m planning out my first media stack (rough thoughts: https://imgur.com/a/A5hqOH5)
 Two specific questions, in order of priority:
  
How should I set up my VPN such that it&#x27;s only routing traffic from certain services (i.e. the -arr stack and the like) and not from others? 
 If you see the diagram above, should the red arrow be there or is this a misunderstanding?Should all traffic route through the reverse proxy?
 In the described use-case above, how should I set up my VPN? Wireguard on the VM, or gluetun or something else?
 
 Any advice about pros / cons in running k3s / microk8s on VM (proxmox) or bare-metal?
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

Do I need to install something, should I run this in a container after its started? Some guidance would definitely be appreciated.

 Unfortunately all the good ones seem to be cloud based (eg https://www.cheqroom.com/ https://www.ezofficeinventory.com/ https://www.assetpanda.com/)...
 Do you guys know anything similar that can be self-hosted? 
 Would be nice if it was open-source, but not a must.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Cloudflare Access to secure my self-hosted (but on public (sub)domains) services. I noticed that the Bitwarden extensions and apps cannot synchronise anymore when I put the URL behind CF Access. Most likely, the sync agent just gets redirected to the cloudflare login panel, which prevents it from actually syncing anything.
 I&#x27;m using Authelia and Bitwarden&#x27;s inbuilt security so it&#x27;s no huge deal, but would be nice if this could somehow still be behind Access as well - redirecting attacks to cloudflare instead of my own server alleviates some of the risks involved and a password manager has to be very well secured imo. 
 If anyone got ideas on how to tackle this, please LMK!

                              <span>I am currently redoing my nextcloud (previously used snap) and after hours of looking i couldnt really find which one to choose or direct comparisons what the benefits of each one are.
 What i have found out so far:
 Aio didnt really work because i dont want to expose nextcloud (instead access via nextcloud.local)
 Snap is pretty limited in therms of options. Also docker versions seems to have better performance than the other ones.
 What are the benefits of each one?

My long-term goal is that I want to have an adaptable graphical timeline visualization that can show the timelines of multiple people and how they overlap and intersect.
 But to avoid falling into the same trap of trying to develop the perfect solution from the get-go before starting the actual collection and never actually starting the project because I got overwhelmed, I&#x27;m looking for the best &quot;starting&quot; solution that lets me expand later.
 My instinct is to go with a Wiki, that way every person has a dedicated page to make tagging and linking fairly trivial later on. It&#x27;s also a recognizable format that lots of people w…</span>

 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I&#x27;m completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a &quot;bad&quot; reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

                              <span>I have Promox running Portainer in 1 VM. Portainer is hosting Homer Intranet page, port 9455; I have Uptime Kuma on 3000. I want homer to display some stats of Uptime Kuma but I keep getting CORS error. Homer troubleshooting says to use a CORS anywhere solution but I just can&#x27;t figure it out. 
 I use Nginx Proxy Manager to create proxies for portainer, 10.1.2.3:9455 to intranet.my.lan. 
 Is it possible to use this same tool for fixing this CORs issue?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m rebuilding my server, while adding more features, moving away for it being just a nas box plus a docker host, it will give me the ability to host vms have software raid etc.
 My 2 options were proxmox, and freenas, having worked with the first, the continuous pop-ups about buying licenses, plus the inability to manage network shares on its own, it&#x27;s a turn off, even if it has a very straightforward way for managing VMs.
 Now, freenas, seems tailored made to act like a nas, with vms feeling like a afterthought, for example, I cannot find a way to have a vm obtain a IP Address from my network&#x27;s DHCP server, only behind NAT.(on proxmox this was a simple toggle called bridge connection) Documentation on this, imply that bridges are for link aggregation. (https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/network/interfaces/bridgecreate/). If there are any solution to this, I&#x27;ll be more than happy to to give freenas a go.

                              <span>Hi all!
 For an internal workflow and data management tool I am looking for the best software. I will most likely use a Postgres Database and would prefer a free project.
 So far I looked at Budibase, Appsmith and Tooljet, of which discarded Budibase for it&#x27;s weird and non-intuitive UI.
 I wondered what other users think about usability and suitable use cases.
 Thank you so much for giving me an insight into your projects, I highly appreciate it!

                              <span>This happens, when you try to get away from hosted services. And this only covers my most basic needs. I still find it way to complicated and convoluted. Any ideas for simplification?
 My self-hosting setup
 Legend:
  
Blue Stuff: Mobile
 Purple Stuff: Desktop
 Grey Stuff: My Server
 White Stuff: Other people&#x27;s servers
 Orange Stuff: Data
 Green Stuff: Actions
  
Suggestions should try to follow these principles:
  
No Software that is written in an interpreted language
 Software needs to be non-commercial and preferably open-source
 If possible, the software should follow an open standard
 Software needs to be standalone, no additional dependencies
 Smaller and simpler is better

                              <span>Hi all; with the way YouTube has continued expanding it&#x27;s ads (both in length and frequency), what self hosted service (Invidious, Viewtube, Piped, etc.) you see as the best way forward for continued access to YouTube content sans the ads and the tracking? I&#x27;ve long hosted a small Invidious instance for myself and a few other folks, but I have been making some changes lately and wanted to see what the most current wisdom on this front was. Thanks!

                              <span>I normally boot onto an SSD, but I just got a new 2tb hard drive. I tried plugging it in, and now when I try to start, I get power for about one second then everything just goes off. 
 I&#x27;m not trying to boot onto the hard drive or anything, just plugged it in for the first time, and am still booting off of the SSD. My assumption now is that my old 450 watt power source doesn&#x27;t have enough power for it, so it&#x27;s just causing the power to go off after a second. Any other ideas what might be causing this? Could an incorrectly plugged in drive cause this? I don&#x27;t see why it would cause it to power off immediately unless it&#x27;s trying to draw too much power.

All the Spotify to mp3 converter are either paid or only allow for up to 1 minute per. Does anyone know how I could do that? I can get Spotify files downloaded from a friend with premium if that is needed.

                              <span>Full disclaimer: I am using a Windows 10 Machine (mostly for Plex) and do not want to switch to Unraid or any other OS. I would like to get this figured out using just Windows 10.
 Please help me understand how this works when I go to set this up on my Windows 10 machine. I currently use Storage Spaces, but it is a pain to use and I&#x27;ve heard good things about using Stablebit DrivePool and Snapraid together and I&#x27;m leaning towards switching.
 I have 10 8TB drives I want to use. From what I&#x27;ve read, I would likely want to use 8 of the drives for data and 2 for parity. I would use DrivePool (without duplication) to essentially make a big 64TB drive (at least that&#x27;s how the pool would present in Windows, right?), and then configure Snapraid to use the 2 remaining disks as parity disks.

 in fact, lately it seems that jd can&#x27;t even grab a single picture or video off of it, and raider gives &#x27;no profile found&#x27; error.

 I was wondering because I always see HDDs for sale on r/buildapcsales and sometimes see some WD reds and red pluses. So is it better to buy whatever I see on sale there for a reasonable price or wait for black friday and shuck the easystore 8tb bestbuy hdds. I&#x27;m not sure how the performance of those drives in the easystore are compared to the ones that go on sale as a sole drive.
 ​
 thanks for inputs!

 Of those one huge channel with 6000 videos over the past 12 years was recently deleted. Still, a seemingly safe gaming channel has had about a dozen videos either privated/unlisted or deleted (some due to newly added age verification hits)
 I do not wish to disclose the exact channels/videos, these videos will soon end up on archive_dot_org. Though it&#x27;s a warning to you: add all your subbed and favorite channels to a daily youtube-dl (yt-dlp) download.
 If you subbed to too many channels to create a list manually: create a Google Takeout for the youtube profile you&#x27;re using, set the smallest archive size. The first archive will contain a CSV with subscriptions.

Obviously I am going to be needing a bit more storage space than the 240GB M2 SSD that&#x27;s already in there. For my intents and purposes I expect to be needing about 10 TB of space. I have already settled for SSDs as opposed to HDDs because of various factors (biggest ones being power and noise) and I am currently working on a plan to integrate them into a flexible system of drives. Since the Nuc I plan on getting only supports one more 2.5&quot; drive I am going to have to come up with solutions to connect the drives externally. I have been researching for many hours now on how that would look like if I want to keep the total cost as low as possible and I have come u…</span>

                              <span>Hi
 I have a rather large video library (none of it personal videos) it&#x27;s all made Movies and Series so I can replace it if I have to, though it would be inconvenient.
 I just filled up my 4th 5tb (because they&#x27;re portable) drive and currently the prices are a bit rediculous, so I&#x27;m gonna be stuck with what I have for a few months. I have two 500gb drives, which is barely large enough for anything. i wanted to merge it into a Spanned Volume so that I&#x27;d have a 1tb drive.
 My question if one fails then what happens to my data. As i said, I can replace the series, since I got them all from the internet or by backing up my DVD collection, so I don&#x27;t mind it but it would be inconvenient.
 Since it&#x27;s just series, performance isnt much of a concern, as long as the shows play smoothly, I&#x27;d be happy.
 Also would it ware my drives out faster. They&#x27;re pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven&#x27;t seen much use. It&#x27;s just 500GB&#x27;s each so I don&#x27;t mind them breaking in a few years but until the prices of the 5tb&#x27;s in my country come down a bit, I don&#x27;t want to replace them.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have 4 x Seagate Exos 7E8 8TB (ST8000NM000A-2KE101) and I just learned that there might be an issue with the factory default settings on these drives resulting in rapidly increasing load cycle due to low disk activity. I have had my drives for about one and a half year on a server that is has very little accessed and I can se the Load_Cycle_Count is already above 45K!! Now I am terrified that these drives will start dying on me. 
 I have these on a Linux system and I am not sure about what to do. I figure I need to install the SeaChest/openSeaChest tool and change some parameters. Does anyone know how to install the tool on Linux and which parameters I need to change? I have the drives set up in a ZFS 2 x mirrored vdev configuration. Are the operations I need to do with the SeaChest tool safe while the drives are in normal operation in the ZFS pool?

                              <span>I have been steadily accumulating video, photo and audio data, as well as project files as long as I&#x27;ve had a computer. My hobbies have led me to take photos on family/friend holidays, special occasions, press shots for people, footage of music videos/live events, downloaded song library for DJing, the list goes on.
 Anxiety warning - until recently this data was sprawled across a collection of relatively unprotected internal hard drives, old USB thumb drives, external drives, memory cards and my current and past machines. I took it upon myself to consolidate this data on one external drive and have since mostly organised it. For the task I chose a WD 12TB My Book external drive, of which I bought two.
 Question - I want to sync the two 12TB external drives through my Windows 10 machine, I&#x27;ll call them A and B.
 After an initial carbon copy of the two drives, the dream is to easily update the B drive now and then with any additions or organisation changes that I make on my A drive, automatically (after plugging both drives into the computer), without having to remember the file pathways for each change or addition.
 I have been informed by some lovely folk over at r/Archiveteam that shucking these enclosures and building a NAS system could be an option for me, but I would like to explore any ideas people had that didn&#x27;t involve buying more hardware. 
 Would appreciate any advice on this, thank you in advance!

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been reading a lot about drives failing and such. I have my media stored on a few drives and would like to know the best way to go about backing them up? This is on a Linux setup.
 Do I just copy them over (after zipping them or something) to another drive? Do I use a backup software, like rsync or Bacula? I don&#x27;t understand much about the redundancy thing with Raid and I also don&#x27;t have the drives or the budget for drives to support it, like some people do.
 My media is mostly movies/shows but there&#x27;s also smaller files, images, books, etc.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>For the mods, this is not advertisement nor selling, just asking. well it very sounds like some hustle, but let me tell you.
 I’m korean (south, obviously), and the thing is, recently one of the biggest filecoin mining pool here has been liquidating their equipments. 
 They said most of their disk’s uptime is average 5000-10000h, manufactured in early 2021, I/O barely happened (they have been ‘floating’ as term in filecoin)
 So I thought, “Well, so they’re basically dumping pre-tested HUGE hard drives (datacenter grade even)?”
 So I bought 2 WD HC530 14TB drives and currently waiting for my PERC H310 to come in order to connect SAS drives.
 I&#x27;ve bought dozens of these liquidation deals time to time, and I can tell you these are the good one. almost new. dustless, no scratches.
 And the second thing to tell you is, since current currency rate is very low for korean won, these are even cheaper in dollars. so I thought “Well, maybe I can sell these to datahoarders?”
 So here I am. Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$. These are used, not refurbished.

                              <span>so i see things like this for big seagate exos drives and the like:
  
Standard model, ships in 512e format, Fast Format allows either 512e or 4Kn sector size 
  
and dont know what it means. is this a feature i should be looking for, or something for compatibility? 
 fyi im running a zfs filesystem on my truenas scale server using mainly repurposed desktop components. i am currently using smallish ironwolf drives but my next pool is going to be a mirror of something like 2 x 12+TB drives and i dont want to buy until i understand this feature.
 thanks all.

                              <span>Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.
 I&#x27;m currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don&#x27;t enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).
 From what I can decipher reading the interview:
  
They&#x27;re intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical&#x27;s traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).
 Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned &quot;somewhere between&quot; Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there&#x27;s currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.
 The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I&#x27;ll leave it at that.
  
What I didn&#x27;t see in the coverage (if I&#x27;m not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we&#x27;re talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc&#x27;s inorganic pitting &quot;secret sauce&quot; or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?
 I&#x27;d be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:
  
How optimistic you are about this project?
 Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we&#x27;re talking WORM) backup.

                              <span>Hey all, I recently discovered Dr. John Campbell&#x27;s YT channel, and in one of his more recent videos he mentioned that he recently received a strike against his channel for proliferating misinformation. If you&#x27;re familiar with his content, he&#x27;s been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he&#x27;s a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it&#x27;s a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won&#x27;t be around for long, since he&#x27;s been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you&#x27;ve ever watched any of his content, you&#x27;d know he&#x27;s extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I&#x27;m thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I&#x27;m looking at? Thank you.

                              <span>Setting up a Synology NAS currently and have a storage pool of 2tb in a RAID 1 config. It’s now asking me to create a volume and logically my brain wants to create a single volume of 2tb, however that seems inefficient as I won’t be using all 2tbs. 
 Is there a functional difference between creating a single max size volume vs creating multiple smaller sized volumes as needed? 
 Also can I get a quick run down on partition vs volume vs allocation size?

                              <span>Folks, I&#x27;ve created and just released an open-source fully automated multithreaded system for archiving images uploaded to Discord channels directly to the WordPress website, with MySQL and AWS S3 cloud storage support.
 It&#x27;s essentially a multithreaded Python script that takes Discord images (e.g. Midjourney or any channel) and sends the full high-resolution version of the image automatically to Amazon S3 storage (creates thumbnails as well) and also auto-uploads each image as a new post (along with all the details) into the WordPress website. This is where either you (as an author) or people (if you share it with the online community) can see the image collection process in real-time (as the archiving process takes place).

                              <span>Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I&#x27;m thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.
 I&#x27;ve come across some comments like &quot;NAS isn&#x27;t intended to be turned on/off&quot; or vague comments such as &quot;they aren&#x27;t rated for that&quot; but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don&#x27;t see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.
 Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.

                              <span>Has anyone looked into this? I did some digging but all I found were logs from https://www.gharchive.org/, these are helpful but I&#x27;ll have to download all of them and then extract the usernames, and then after that clone each repository.
 ​
 Just asking if there&#x27;s already an existing tool, it would be nice to have something where I can have a threshold of how many stars each repository has.
 ​
 I already did most of the work and I can continue using my method, but I&#x27;m just asking if there&#x27;s something that already exists and is maintained.
 ​
 Here are the steps I took:
 I&#x27;ve downloaded all the logs in 2 methods
  
using the API on https://www.gharchive.org/ &#x60;wget https://data.gharchive.org/20{15..22}-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz&#x60;, it actually ended up being 800GB which is insane
 the other way is to use google cloud platform BigQuery, I downloaded a CSV of users which was almost the size of 300MB CSV file
  
now that I have these, I can then use github api to get their repositories.

 Thinking books as well and guides for gardening. Size isn’t really an issue as I’m planning on building a nas to connect to my solar generator. Just some stuff to get started, I have about 10TB of shows and movies as such (rather small). Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!

 I’m looking to move away from my QNAP NAS to a DAS. The DAS will be connecting to an HP ProDesk 600 G6 Mini which is running as a Plex server / Home Assistant server, and which supports USB C 3.1 Gen 2 (or USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 as HP like to call it!). It doesn’t support Thunderbolt. The DAS won&#x27;t be moving to any other computers at any time, staying connected to the server.
 I don’t want to add extra stress to the server (i3-10300T and 32gb DDR4-2667 but runs 24/7 for HA) so I’m thinking hardware RAID, and because I’ll be running at least four drives I want RAID 5 support. I can’t fit a RAID card in the ProDesk 600 G6 min…</span>

Media of all types: books, films, videos, music, audio, animation, photo and art. It is more or less organized as filesystem and folders/subfolders serve as categories/tags of interest. Last couple years i have thoughts maybe there is better and more robust ways to catalog and use my stuff.
 Today i gave it a light google search and found some free solutions: GCStar, DataCrow, Tellico. Did not tried them yet because it looks like a lot of work to transfer from my current way of doing things and get feeling of the programs usability.
 Most important things for me now:

 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096WHH242?psc&#x3D;1&amp;ref&#x3D;ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
 Price is right imho and once installed crystal disk says they have been powered on 2 times with 4 hours of run time and no errors. Seems legit? I am thinking of adding them into my NAS and building a new set based of 12TB drives with maybe 3 more for a total of 5. Am i missing something or should I check something else before buying more? I have been out of the NAS drives game for so long i feel newbish.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 ​
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. 
 I&#x27;d prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. 
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

                              <span>(Wow. The title is awesomely misleading.) I have a lot of conference videos which i need to stream to people who are interested in listening to again. Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into &quot; nsfw&quot; territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?
 We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>After having many issues with flash drives over the years, I have recently reverted back to using optical media for backup/ archival purposes. Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. 
 I&#x27;ve found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. 
 I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I&#x27;m working on periodically. 
 I&#x27;ve had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them. I use SSDs instead.

                              <span>Posting in r/DataHoarder since we got such a great response last time :) We mirrored a *lot* more books from Z-Library. We were pretty surprised by how much their collection has grown over the last year, since we first scraped it in mid 2021.
 Anyway our full blog post is here: http://annas-blog.org/blog-3x-new-books.html Seeds would be again very welcome. We got a good number of seeds for our first collection, so thanks for helping with that!

                              <span>I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can&#x27;t quite remember when I purchased and how much I&#x27;ve used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was &quot;stored&quot; on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I&#x27;d been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)
 I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn&#x27;t the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?
 Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.
 I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I&#x27;ve run some tests on it I&#x27;m starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical
 (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)

                              <span>Hey folks, I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of advice from all the posts here through the years, but now I have a question that warrants a post.
 I am looking to add more extended battery systems, but am out of rack space to mount them. I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?
 I&#x27;ve got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg
 Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better. I wonder if anyone has had any experience with this.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I have a small question concerning the CPU Temperature on my Dell R715 running Proxmox (Linux). My end goal is to write a script that change fan speed depending on the cpus temperature. I have the script written and in a working state, but I don&#x27;t really know what temperature to listen to.
 Why I don&#x27;t know what temperature to trust ? well, because nothing makes sense!
 Here are my temperatures reported by IPMI and sensors when the server is at idle (with working LXC container, but not much load:

 And here is temperatures when all 16 cores are stressed:

 As you can see, underload temperatures risesd in the sensors command, but not in the…</span>

                              <span>I picked up a 42u rack locally and I’m now realizing it’s definitely a networking rack and I have some concerns. I’d love to use this rack if possible because it’s very sturdy and too heavy to move again 😂
 Question is will an R730 fit in this threaded rack where the depth between the front and back threads is 27.5” (69.85cm)? I found I need to buy the Dell 331-0166 2U PKCR1 2CGTG Threaded ReadyRail Adapter kit to made this work which I’m willing to do but now worried that it’s too shallow for the rails to properly click in and seat the server?
 I don’t care if it sticks out of the back past the rack, I don’t have a back cover. I’m new to this and just want to make sure before I invest in the adapter kit and rails that it’ll slide in there properly. 
 I have a PE 2950 III as well I plan to rack so I’ll need two kits if anyone has one to sell! 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi all - long time lurker first time poster,
 I’ve got my hands on two older desktops which I want to use as a NAS, and for labbing around with in vm’s and such. (Possibly also a BlueIris NVR)
 Pc’s are both running i7-4790’s and have 32GB of 1600Mhz DDR3. Both machines have 256gb of SATA SSD and 128GB of PCI SSD (dont ask about the PCI i dont know either) One also has a Quadro K4000 and the other a Quadro K4200
 Ive also got access to 6x 2TB WD Black Enterprise drives, with 4 being already installed in one machine and 2 sitting cold, as well as the odd 1TB HDD sitting as storage in the other machine
 I’ve and have played with Proxmox on these, but not sure if I have enough power to run or if its overkill for what I want to be doing - eg if TrueNAS will be sufficient
 Not sure how well Plex &amp; BlueIris NVR will go on the hardware due to being virtualised and being on the older side. 
 Would love some opinions! PFA of my dusty and cable mess of new projects! (don’t worry will be cleaned soon)

                              <span>Hello,
 I am an amateur photographer mostly focusing on wildlife photography but occasionally help out other with events. I am currently self hosting my storage solutions using truenas in a VM that is not exposed remotely. I am looking for some software solutions for the following tasks: 
  
Remote uploading photos from wherever I am. I would like to be able to make backups easily. Deduplication would be nice feature here. This would need security but I believe nginx can handle that.
 File download if someone has a link, username, and password ( does not have to be super secure but ddos protection would be nice). To share files with people and event organizers when relevant. Zipping would be nice
 Basic file/directory exploration. I would like to be able to share a single photo with people or see if I have a photo of a particular bird species .
  
What I have tried:
  
Libre photos does not seem to have upload or download tools and not directory structure
 Next cloud seems to be a lot more that I need and doesn&#x27;t seem to play nice with truenas for me at least accessing existing files.
 Currently I manually make zip files for sharing and link them in html tag for download but that can be time intensive
  
I would prefer FOSS but I am willing to talk if it&#x27;s cheap enough. This is all hobby work.

                              <span>Hi all - I&#x27;ve been slowly building up my lab from having a single 6-core server to also having a few older generation NUCs and a laptop. With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don&#x27;t care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.
 Now, I&#x27;ve installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it&#x27;s really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. 
 So my questions are: 
 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? 
 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).
 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?
 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?
 Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out. Sorry if some of those questions are basic, I wasn&#x27;t able to get conclusive answers on the web.

                              <span>So i install FreeIPA so I could run ldap for sso and use it as a certificate authority. 
 I cant reach the WebUI from my desktop computer. I can ssh in, I can get a kerberos ticket from my desktop as well. I checked to make sure httpd is working and it is. I even install a user interface to see if i could reach the webUI from itself, I can. 
 When I type in the IP address for the server, it switches to the FQDN. Then gives me &quot;Unable to connect&quot; error. 
 I didn&#x27;t set up dns when i installed it, so I imagine it is dns some how

                              <span>Hey there!
 ​
 I&#x27;m running Mac Mini Late 2012 with Debian as a home server.
 I just got done with installing ssh and I was wondering how can I have movies / series MP4s be watchable with all of my devices? 
 I read that SMB is pretty unsecure. Is there an SMB alternative that is more secure?
 Also having a Web GUI would be cool since I don&#x27;t have any DE installed.
 ​
 The software would need to run on Samsung Smart TV, PS3, mobile devices etc.
 ​
 Thanks for reading my post

                              <span>Just looking for some info/advice please.
 Currently I have a home server that I&#x27;m running a few services on and exposing some of these (nextcloud, bitwarden etc) to the internet via a cloudflare tunnel and routing internal traffic through nginx proxy manager.
 I&#x27;ve been having a play with some cloud based servers lately, mainly just as a testing ground for projects. I was wondering if it is possible, or even if there would be any security benefits to point my domains/cloudflare tunnel to the cloud server and then route the traffic via a tunnel or VPN connection in to my home server from the cloud server?
 If this is possible and there is an advantage in it please could someone help out with some info on what software/setup you used?

                              <span>I have an HP z600 that I am using to host a cople services, such as portianer. In my server is included a NVIDIA Quadro P2000 that doesn&#x27;t seem to get recognized automatically by portainer. I tried looking around online but I haven&#x27;t seen any similar problem 
 I oblviously made sure that both portainer and NVIDIA Drivers are at the latest version available, was wondering if anyone had encountered this problem before and if it is solvable 
 I am currently running Ubuntu Server 20.04.5 LTS

 some of these services are: Photoprism, Navidrome, Jellyfin, Qbitorrent
 Is there any service that can add 2FA to these existing services ?
 or is there any modifcation that can be done to these existing services themselves to get 2FA ? 
 Thanks in advance for any help :)

                              <span>I often see posts or videos about homelab projects and almost everytime I hear no mention about SWAG with nginx or traefik being mentioned instead. I personally use SWAG for reverse-proxy and certs and I&#x27;m happy with it but seeing that almost everyone else is using other platform I feel like an outsider and I start to wonder: what am I missing? Is not SWAG the right choice to secure and proxy my web-services? And why I don&#x27;t see more people talking about it?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have an HP envy laptop with i7-10510U and 16gb ram and 500GB SSD (even has a discrete 250MX nvidia GPU).
 It is currently mostly unused, I was running proxmox on it for some time with a few VMs and containers, but currently thinking of migrating to TrueNAS Scale, the obvious problem with a laptop that there are no sata ports (or expandability in general is very limited).
 So in order to really benefit zfs and use it as a proper NAS, the only way it seems is using some sort USB enclosures/dockings for SATA HDDs/SSDs, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a decent option.
 Note: there&#x27;s a USB-C port which can act as a display port / charging / data - perhaps there are some things for storage I can plug in there as a more reliable alternative to &quot;just regular&quot; USB-A ports?
 Note2: The data stored on it is not super critical, mostly family photos and some movies etc. and I&#x27;m backing up automatically to Backblaze anyway, so things like ECC memories and edge cases are not really a concern.
 Alternative option:
 I have a tower gaming PC which is running pretty much 24/7 anyway, so I could through in a bunch of HDDs, and run TrueNAS scale in hyper-v. Though that leaves the laptop without a purpose really, and it has more than decent hardware for a home server.
 What do you suggest?
 Thanks

Is there a way to repurpose these using some self hosted method to pick up the signal or turn them into some generic radio signal I can use my rtl setup to pick up or are they essentially trash now?

 What I would like to know is if there is any way or tool to delete some data from the source automatically after it is synced with my syncthing and uploaded to the destination?
 I don&#x27;t know if in syncthing or with another tool that could be done to keep the source disks always with enough space

                              <span>Hi!
 I setup Homer using Docker with Portainer, but the one thing I don&#x27;t get running are the Services / Status. My mapped directory contains the config file and folders for icons, but where do I place the content of homer/src/components/services/? Or are those already somewhere? :-) For pihole I then added:
  - name: &quot;Pi-hole&quot; url: &quot;http://192.168.2.100/admin&quot; tag: &quot;smarthome&quot; logo: &quot;assets/tools/icons/pihole.png&quot; subtitle: &quot;&quot; # optional, if no subtitle is defined, PiHole statistics will be shown type: &quot;PiHole&quot; 
 But nothing is shown :-(
 ​
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Looking for self hosted tool for track own tasks, I use notion but wants sth selfhosted, I really would love following features * multiple project&#x27;s * project card can contains markdown content * card can have custom property * multiple views and filters * API
 Actually that could be two different apps just wants to have possibility to connect card with note via some kinda link or sth
 Does anyone know something what might be worth to have a look? Or maybe you use something to track personal tasks what might be better?

                              <span>Until I started meddling with self-hosted services I thought that I know at least enough about networks and requests but struggling to understand what some services do, thought me differently. 
 I am currently running a test server (playing around and learning Proxmox). This one is a gen 6 i3 NUC. I am waiting for a gen 8 i5 NUC to arrive. The idea is to make a Proxmox cluster and put all the essential services on the weaker device and all the other goodies on the more powerful one. In the next few days, I will ask some questions to better understand what I actually need. 
 Intro
 My network is a very simple one. I use /24 address space on a Synology router as the default gateway, and behind it have currently two Win10 machines, soon to be two NUCs, a TV, and a printer hardwired, and every…</span>
