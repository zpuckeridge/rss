        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. Looking for a bit of a sanity check. I currently have a R720 with two 2695 V2 and 128G of Ram. Currently this is pretty overkill for what I need and I am looking at downsizing to a regular tower. I am stuck between buying a motherboard to house one of the 2695 and half the ram and then try sell the rest. The other option I am considering is moving to a epyc 7302, and then I can sell the R720 as a whole, which I think I would have more luck. I am not 100% sure if the move from a 2695 to a 7302 is really worth the $1200 CAD it will cost me or if I'm better to just use what I have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tl;Dr: Is virtualizing FreeNAS/TrueNAS in Proxmox alongside having other VMs for other functions a good idea?
 I have a vague idea of what I'm doing but at the end of the day I'm learning still.
 Purpose of this project: Half of it is to take some functionality off my main gaming rig and put it into a server that can run 24/7, and the other half is to experiment and learn some neat things. Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.
 Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)
 This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.
 For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.
 After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?
 And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in the best way to sync files from OneDrive to Apple's iCloud Drive. I've read multiple articles on the issue but most deal with cost, which in my scenario is a non-issue because I'm already paying for OneDrive (professional reasons) and the family is on the icloud 2TB plan. I'm looking at about 100-300 GB of data. I have apple, windows and linux laptops, also proxmox servers. What I don't have, is a clear-cut solution to syncing OneDrive to iCloud Drive. Two-way sync would be nice, but it's not a must.
 My preferred Apple laptop for this application is an old retina MacBook Pro 2013 that doesn't run Monterey, but I'm willing to buy some SH Mac Mini for this situation. Currently the solution is more important than the cost TBH bceasue I'm looking for a set and forget scenario.
 I'm hoping others can describe solutions if in a similar situation. I was thinking of the following:
 Option 1: Setup a macOS system to do the syncing. Setup OneDrive and iCloud Drive to "keep all files locally" and then rsync between the two folders. 
 Pros:
  
native syncing of iDrive
  
Cons:
  
my macOS laptop for this "application" is a bit old (2013 rMBP) which is currently unsupported. I don't want to run unsupported OSes for security reasons and I don't want workarounds, especially when settings this up for the next few years;
 dedicated Apple Hardware to do the task, whereas Windows VMs might do the trick;
 Unable to check if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and healthy. When OneDrive might fail, it could desync, but worst case scenario I think it could completely wipeout 
  
Option 2 Run a Windows VM, signed in to iCloud Drive and OneDrive, both setup to keep all files on device.
 Pros:
  
cheapest and most portable
  
Issues:
  
as above, unable to automcatically check and resolve if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and sync is healthy.

 I have a laptop hard drive I want to plug into my PC right now to copy a back up of it. My pc is already running 2 hard drives and my SSD with windows 11 on it. I want to confirm that it is safe to plug in the laptop hard drive to sata and it won't automatically format it or anything. It has data that is important on it that we don't want to lose so I thought it would be easiest to plug into my pc and extract a copy. It also has a copy of windows on the laptop HDD. I am just asking to make sure. I've done it before with another laptop hard drive, but I just am making sure again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm completely missing the basics of how Wireguard should work on a router... I'm using a Cudy X6 router. Love it, and it has Wireguard built in as both a client and server, but I can't seem to wrap my head around how to actually set it up!
 Here's what I'm working with.

 I thought, from my limited understanding, that the IP Address is what I would use when connected to access devices that are on Wireguard. Under Clients, I have this set up... is this just my router IP address as the Hostname and what IP address I'd like to use to connect to it over Wireguard?

 Thank you. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental, but there's little to no help on this specific server, and generic Wireguard tutorials haven't gotten me there.
 Ultimately, I'm trying to access ANY device on my network when connected via Wireguard.

 What I was wondering, is if I could run a local ad service with no actual ads that would allow me to not really have ads but allow mobile games to "think" there was an ad. So basically redirecting my DNS to spoof the real ad server and tell the game that the ad was successful and give me the perk.
 There may be some questionable morals here but they started it by giving more ad time than actual game play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current home server (a Gigabyte Brix with 16GB of memory) is becoming too small for my needs. Therefore I am looking for a new home server. There are two options I can't decide between are:
 Option 1: Desktop PC as a server
 As my needs often change, I am considering building a desktop PC as my server (Example CPU: Intel Pentium Gold G7400T (TDP 35W), obviously no graphics card and an efficient Power Supply). Since this would allow me to, later on, add more parts (e.g. more drives, upgrade to 2.5GBase LAN, etc...). 
 Option 2: Intel NUC
 Or go with an Intel NUC (with an Intel Core i5-1135G7), as it is a very nice all-in-one solution with just a 12W TDP. 
 To my Question:
 How high is the power consumption for such a Desktop PC as I have described above, especially in comparison to an Intel NUC? What are your recommendations?

(Consumer wifi routers sometimes have decent web UIs, but are notoriously feature-poor.)
 So is there a free/FOSS firewall solution out there that has ripped off Cisco's CLI?

 I hope this is the right place. Over the years my iPhone photos and videos have numbered 300,000 with a total of 1.8 terabytes of cloud space. 
 I’d like to back these up physically but iCloud Photos on PC has severe limitations. I can’t physically download more than 999 photos at a time. 
 Im currently trying to back up my iCloud to Photo folder to google drive then use google drive to download everything on my eternal hard drive directly. Will this work or have I started a path to futility? 
 I’ve tried multiple phones calls with apple support and they are unable to advise on a clear path except for I need to get a Mac.
 I saw another thread somewhere where an individual had a python script to batch download photos. 
 Just looking for the easiest solution. (I guess if I needed to buy a Mac to aid in downloading them all to a external hard drive and then return it) wouldn’t be the end of the world for me as long as that would work for a fact. 
 All advice is welcome. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently working on becoming a Network Admin (for work) and Systems Admin(for fun because why not) and the next couple of months have finally let me get back to a server I bought a couple of months back (R720 8bay with perc 710 mini). I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)
 I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:
 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)
 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives
 I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process
 Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently? ( In the future I want to add PCIe NVMe drives for faster storage just as a side note) Any insight is appreciated and thanks everyone

 The error doesnt bother me, i assume its because the disk is damaged. BUT! When i click "ignore" it continues, but it is incredibly slow. 
 A regular CD/DVD might take 10 minutes to save. When this error pops up, 1% progression took 30 minutes. It still works, however it works extremly slow. 
 I tried a couple of diffrent damaged disks, i tried PowerISO and AnyBurn. It produced the same result. The process is incredibly slow after the error. 
 The error came at the beggining of one CD, the other CD produced the error at the end. The latter was at 98% and took an hour after the error. The first i gave up, 1% progression after 30 minutes. 
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been attempting this for the last 2 days and it seems that every time I make some progress, I move on to the next step and I get stopped by a new issue or conflict.
 Situation:
  
1 domain name
 
1 public IP/physical machine (running Proxmox)
 
2 containers:
  
PiVPN running ddclient for Dynamic DNS and Wireguard (works and can connect to network/Proxmox UI remotely) - port 51830
 Ubuntu 20.04 which will run a Minecraft server - port 55055
 
  
My goal is that I would like to connect to my vpn remotely through Wireguard via the vpn.mydomain.io domain name and also allow a group of 10-15 friends access the Minecraft server via mc.mydomain.io. I attempted to set up a nginx reverse proxy server outside of the VPN and the Minecraft server to switch traffic respectively, but I found out that you cant put MC data behind nginx/HTTP.
 Is there any type of setup that would allow me to achieve this functionality? The MC server should essentially be open to public access and the VPN requires a Wireguard config, but both are accessed via different domain names linked to the same public IP.
 Any input is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My sister lost her husband during the height of the COVID pandemic. He had just built a new rig. I'm the family "IT call center" so she called and said it was time to organize things and asked if I could get everything off that she could still access from her laptop as needed, things that are on this PC are family paperwork, finances, wills, death certificate, etc.. Important stuff!!. She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.
 Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive. But is this the right way? She doesn't know where all his stuff was stored and doesn't want to miss anything I'm sure there's more than just in the "documents" folder. How can I ensure I get everything that may be on the rig worth saving?
 I've done some googling on backup software and sounds like I can achieve doing that. I guess I just want to be sure that it is the right approach?? And will I be able to give my sister a drive with a file dump? Is something like that achievable?
 Does backup software just grab entire OS? Or can I grab just every file? Sorry for the long winded post. Really not sure how to help her here and just give her an external drive where she can just access everything that may have been important on the PC. 
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, im starting to plan my next file server. It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.
 Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.
 So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).
 So, I could use some guidance on:
 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?
 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?
 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?
 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this? Once this thing is configured,I want to be able to do remote admin from my main workstation (win10).
 Teach me Sensei! Thanks 🙏

I bought one off eBay and it works great overall, but 10+ year old firmware that shipped on it doesn't seem to work with any modern web browser (doesn't support TLS 1.2, etc). I found an old reference to files like that being on a homelab FTP site, but judging from the wiki that seems to be defunct. 
 Anyone have a source or contact at Gigamon I can use? Thanks!

I was wondering if there would be any issues if we split the cost on a VPS and "shared" it, just to kind of mess around with one and explore/experiment with different things (nothing illegal). I guess I'm just curious if they would allow 2 different IP's logging into the VPS at different times. Thank you!

 The PCs I use most often are both unable to install things (one is a work PC, the other a chromebook). If I wanted to run something that requires a windows install without using my desktop, could I run a virtual machine on the QNAP, and access it via a browser on the chromebook or work PC?
 I imagine this wouldn't be optimal - particularly for anything requiring a graphics card to do much? But I'd be interested if it was possible.

 Wired ethernet, mini display port, and usb-c and a connections. Curious if anyone's tried or thinking about trying this with a good linux install.

 I'm not super familiar with the Synology platform as a whole, but I have a friend that has an older NAS (DS214) from Synology that they are looking to get rid of. I have been looking for something more power efficient than my dual-Xeon server, so I am going to pick it up later today.
 That being said, how safe is it to use an older NAS? How often do they receive updates, and what sort of lifespan should I expect for this device?
 It very well may be out of support already, but it meets the basic NAS requirements that I have at the moment, so provided I can secure it properly I think it'll be a great choice for my use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I've been a lurker here for quite some time, and now that I'm starting to earn some money it's time to get myself a homelab.
 I've already experimented with an HP DL380 G7, but the power consumption was just too much to run it 24/7 (I'm in France so electricity isn't cheap).
 I'd like to build a server with consumer hardware: classic ATX motherboard, Core/Ryzen CPU so I'm not stuck with a motherboard which pulls 50W alone and other hardware which isn't made to be efficient at idle.
 My problem is that I'd like to build this in a rack form factor, ideally a 2U chassis with at least a dozen 2.5" SAS/SATA bays (I plan to use SATA SSDs because of the lower power consumption compared to HDDs). I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).
 I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?
 So there are two possibilities:
  
my 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;
 I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^
  
I hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either. Please don't hesitate to ask questions about my requirements, I may have missed some points!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What.a.day.
 I got this huge project dumped on my desk this afternoon, and I am hoping some of you out here would be able to give me some pointers.
 Some context:
 We produce a software used by 80-odd companies.
 We collect data from various sources:
  
Datadog: usage of the software (which user accesses which function, at what time)
 HubSpot (CRM): Which stage of onboarding each company is at (i.e.: onboarding, admins onboarded, users onboarded, trial ongoing, etc…) 
 AWS database (RDS): user information (i.e.: how many users per company, data pertaining to the app functions, etc.) 
  
The project:
 The project is straightforward: produce a self-hosted platform that aggregates all that data (from all of these sources) and produce analytics, visually. 
  
For example, how is the productivity of a specific company before and after the company started using our product. Or, how much is each company using our software. Or, how is the usage of the tool varying, week by week.
  
Basically fancy graphs. 
 And, at the end, I need to be able to share these results with said companies, via an online portal (where the company can only access their own data)—preferably securely (password protected, SSL, etc.). 
 The process:
 As far as I can see, the steps are quite straightforward, when simplified:
  
Identify where the data required is stored 
 Centralize it somewhere (probably AWS S3?)
 Feed into the data visualization platform (self-hosted) 
 Serve the output externally.
  
The question:
 What data visualization platform would meet all the criteria outlined in the brief above? 
 So far, I have identified:
  
QlikView (I believe there is a self-hosted solution)
 Tableau
 AWS QuickSight
  
None of these tick all the boxes, but it would get me started. 
 Any other suggestions?
 Edit: clarifications & punctuation.

While away, I could stream songs from EITHER Spotify or my home collection- like the server looks at both my at-home collection and what Spotify offers & weaves them together to send to my client app? I know if I was on my desktop w/ the music collection local, I can ask Spotify to scan & include locally stored music and then just use Spotify, but I want access to my home collection while away from home on my cell without having to close my subsonic-ish client to open Spotify & switch between them. Does anything like that even exist?

 I was wondering if there was any sort of self-hosted web server where the sole purpose is to provide a webpage that you could browse the web through, basically a browser inside of a webpage, but when you enter a URL into it, it filters it with uBlock Origin and other filtering protections first, and then renders the page.
 The goal would be to use that self-hosted webpage and access it from iOS as a means of circumventing the iOS restriction of a proper ad-blocker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently running my setup on an 11 year old RAID controller on a Windows 7 machine (I know, but reasons). I am looking to refresh my setup soon and add more disks and I'd like to remove this old Adapter 5805 from service before it becomes an issue (already failed once and I just happened to have a backup card at that point but some data DID corrupt!). 
 ​
 However, I do enjoy having Backblaze backing up my data and I cannot swing paying for B2 so I'd like to stay on my unlimited, which means "local" storage. Do TrueNAS or Unraid offer a method to passthrough data to the OS natively (to Windows 10 in a VM hosted on the same box)? I haven't seen a way yet in researching this. I know with dedicated NAS/SAN units I could setup an iSCSI target and I've done that in the past but I wasn't sure if this is a possibility within these OSes and I also not sure if I wanted to go through that method so looking for alternatives.
 ​
 Any suggestions or info on using the data within a vm, as a local disk, on TrueNAS/Unraid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With so many people jumping into the PhotoPrism boat, I want to give a shout out to PiGallery2. Not to dis PhotoPrism - it's gorgeous - it's just too much machine for my needs.
 I have very simple, but specific, requirements for a photo... "browser"(?) but have been having a nightmare finding one that sticks.
 I just needed something that I point to my curated folder structure of photos and displays them - read-only - in a nice, quick fashion.
 PiGallery2 does this by the truckload!
 All of the others I've tried either require multiple elements to their docker-compose, try to get too clever with re-organising the photos, are too cluttered, buggy, or lock your setup into their database or specific configs.
 I can now continue to organise my photos in a way I like on my NAS - making sure the location and tagged names are all just-so - and let PiGallery2 serve them up in a simple web view for the family to browse through. Without the worry of them nausing up any files! My god, it's almost too perfect.
 I'm not affiliated with this at all, I just love it when I come across a project that does one thing and does it well!
 Because of the one-way indexing I can completely destroy the Docker container and bring it all back up again without having to re-configure the world.
 I can't see any donate buttons on the site - how does one donate to such a project? I need to go share some financial love while I'm on this high.
 OK, OK, I'll stop gushing.

 New rack: https://greatcabinets.com/product/wm/ (39"/19U model with the plexi door)
 New UPS: https://www.apc.com/us/en/product/SMT1500RM2UC/apc-smartups-line-interactive-1500va-rackmount-2u-120v-6x-nema-515r-outlets-smartconnect-port+smartslot-avr-lcd/
 Existing: Cisco Catalyst 2960X, HP Elitedesk 800 G4, HP Prodesk G4 400, 24 port patch panels x2, Xfinity modem, two 1U PDU's and some other random IoT stuff. Probably another 50lbs max so I'm guessing we're talking 150 lbs. weight max.
 The existing rack is a 12U open frame rack mounted to a brick wall in my house. The new rack is going in the same place but I want to make sure I mount it properly.
 So that's the question...what hardware should I use to mount this new rack so that all my gear doesn't spontaneously and violently meet my floor when I'm least expecting it thus ruing thousands of dollars worth of stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies in advance if this kind of question is not allowed here 😊
 I am looking to create a file sharing service that works on a local network (that's not exposed to the internet) .
 The use case: I'm from a remote African village where internet is expensive and slow, and lots of people (when I'm there) ask for commonly used Apks (mostly WhatsApp, and other utility things like pdf readers) and also some other kinds of files. When I can I share these /download for them.
 I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.
 My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.
 Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.
 The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks

I would also like to thank every one who uploaded different sets of these magazines on archive already. Without them putting everything together simply wouldn't be possible. I can not and will not take credit for there hard work and dedication to preservation. I just wanted to get everything together in one package for everyone to be able to have easy access to all of them. Thank you so much for all the awards and appreciation but please thank them as well. They deserve it more than I do. 
 I have every single issue of nintendo power magazine all 285 issues of it uploaded to archive.org
 https://archive.org/details/nintendo-power-issue-128
 magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8a1a883270f3f094150ce258a26b4ca581839153
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d69aOgbHU_hrI--Ie5Xhf84fHOkk6lMd/view?usp=share_link
 magnent and back up of the original archive.org torrent.
 Last time a big set of these were on there nintendo took it down so I'm sure it will happen again sometime. Either way I have them all backed up on my hard drive as well and was wondering how a good way to preserve all of these would be. Reason being is because as far as I know from days of looking and researching. There is no complete set of these magazines outside of the one I just uploaded last night. I used many existing sources to get them all with the help of some awesome dudes I met in another subreddit who had 2 i was missing to complete the set. If anyone wants to help preserve these before nintendo comes a swinging it would be very much appreciated. Thank you all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody I have multiple external drives that I kept all my files. I have used "whereisit" software for cataloging and to save content of these discs. It was a great software because it scans all the files inside a drive and save the content of this drive to its database. Then whenever I am looking for a file I search through whereisit database without even connecting the related external drive. 
 As far as I understand from the whereisit web site it is discontinued so I am looking for an alternative software to make a catalogue of a drive. (win and macos compatibility is preferred)
 any alternative is welcomed (macos, win, docker)

 I’ve recently been married, and I have all of our documents organized in a binder, but I wonder if there is a better way to keep documents.
 At the moment, they are not protected from water or fire, and that is something if like to consider.
 I live in a smallish apartment, so getting a safe is kind of out of the question. Besides making good scans of the documents, can you recommend anything to keep my documents safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I have been running Nextcloud in my UnRAID for a bit now under the URL nextcloud.{mydomain}
 I have my subdomains set up in Cloudflare dashboard with a dyndns docker image to constantly grab my public ip. 
 This is all set up in SWAG by editing:
 nano /mnt/user/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/nextcloud.subdomain.conf.sample
 and linking to the nextcloud docker and domain along with the appropriate port. 
 Now, I am trying to do the same thing but with a game server for ARK. I did the same thing, and even used the nextcloud sample configuration as it is very simple, and created a theisland.{mydomain}. To my surprise this actually worked, and it pointed the connection right to the correct internal port. Making a second one for another ARK map is where things led to trouble. 
 For some reason, I created an exact copy as the one for theisland.{mydomain} but for lostisland.{mydomain}. Instead of the IP redirecting to the correct internal port, it just points to my public IP. 
 Any ideas to why this may be the case? 
 If I am missing any information please just ask.

 I am, however, interested in sticking bigger hard drives in them. I have read that they will work with 4TB drives and some 6TB drives but the 6TB can be iffy. Supposedly most of the 4TB drives out there will work. I'm curious if anyone has experience putting larger drives in them and whether or not those drives were recognized at full capacity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just got some SFP+ NICs and I'm trying to figure out how I can set up Proxmox to use the 10G NICs for all the connections it can, while using RJ45 for communication with APs, any other servers, and devices.
 My first idea was to make a bridge with just the SFP+ NICs, a bridge with that bridge and the RJ45 NICs, and then give that one to OPNsense. However, that would mean any RJ45 servers on the same network would all go through OPNsense when they're on the same VLAN which is unnecessary.
 What's the best way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's also a rare series (Paddington Bear 1976).
 I lost the DVD a long time ago but retained the VIDEO_TS files, which I've since converted to mkv. The issue is, each file has an odd length at [25:56], but each episode is about 4-5 minutes long, causing some episodes to split between files. I don't know how it happened (I didn't convert the DVD) but I want to correct this. So my questions are:
  
Do we have any control over how the VIDEO_TS files are created? And if so, how does it work?
 If I had to manually edit the files and stitch the split ones together, what opensource software would be best? I use Windows 11...don't OS shame me please you Linux and Ubuntu users.

 As you can see, Cloudflare has the ability to put all dns queries under a secure tunnel to their servers.
 How do i do this by myself with dnsmasq? Do i just start my resolver after connecting to a vpn??
 Btw, Cloudflare has their own dns protocol named WARP that acts like a vpn and encrypts your traffic.

 My self-hosting has been always been completely LAN based, and a VPN for when I'm abroad.. After seeing a few posts stating "Got my complete lab behind SSO", it inspired me to set-up SSO with Authentik - So I've spent the past week rebuilding my K3S clusters (I run 3 of them) in preperation for this, adding in some of the missing pieces (Cert Manager etc).
 Anyway, I've just gone to begin utilisng it with the 3 mains apps I want remote access too, i.e. Plex, Emby and AudioBookShelf - Just to realise, none of them support OICD or SAML... The best I can do, is Emby with LDAP auth.
 I'd really like to understand, how others are approaching this?
 For clarity - I'm looking to put a common authentication mechanism for apps that I want to expose the the internet.. i.e. So I login in to Authentik once, and have access to what I need, I also avoid the need to manage multiple accounts across multiple apps..

The answer, "looks like six fibers but don't know the rating" wasn't a terrible answer, as these things go. And based on the stated dimensions of the reel and what I can see in the photo, it's at least a few hundred feet of cable. So what the heck, I placed a bid without doing the in-person inspection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm hoping I can get some guidance from anyone with experience with what I'm trying to achieve: send mail on behalf of my users without landing in the spam folder.
 Some months ago I made what now seems like a masochistic decision to create an email service. At the outset I knew that deliverability would be an issue but now, even with all appropriate records set up (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, PTR) and server configured correctly, messages are still go straight to spam (GMail).
 My mail server is hosted by DigitalOcean and I've learned that entire ranges of their IP addresses have been blacklisted. I've tried assigning different Reserved IPs to mail server but so far it's no help. One obvious option is to try moving the mail server to a different provider entirely, but I'm not sure which providers have good reputation AND are cost effective AND will allow sending. I'm open to suggestions on this.
 Another option I was considering is using a third-party for sending since the larger players tend to have excellent reputation. But I'm not sure if this can work for my service. With services like SendGrid and MailGun, domains and senders need to be validated. My service allows users to create multiple profiles (senders) — I alone have ~180 — so limits on such services would probably be reached very quickly. If sending from custom domains these services require adding DNS records, but this wouldn't be appropriate in my case as the records would have references to the third-party domains.
 What would be the best option to ensure email delivery?
 Any useful suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance.

I was wondering, if I bought a fan-less hard drive enclosure and put it inside, would that help? Or is there another way to cool it down when in use?
 I don't use it that much atm. Just for backups. But in case I ever needed to use it more frequently for longer periods of time, the information would come in handy.

 I just subscribed yesterday and previously was using Windscribe with no issues.
 I've tried to switch to different servers with no luck. I've also tried to add 1.1.1.1 as my dns.
 Please help. Docker compose file is below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you guys recommend DISCTECH for buying some Factory Refurbished hard drives? They seem legit, but I'm on the fence. I really like that they (supposedly) don't open the factory seal and re-test the drives like ServerPartDeals does. If the manufacturer just recertified a drive, I don't want a seller opening it and re-testing ya know?
 Edit: I'm starting to think it's probably better to get a "Manufacturer Recertified" drive than a "Factory Refurbished". Refurbished likely means it was a repaired drive that was bad, when a Recertified should indicate a returned/open box drive. Does this logic sound right?
 Any opinions are appreciated cause I trust y'all.
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Factory Refurbished from DiscTech:
 https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-Exos-X16-ST16000NM001G-16GB-512e-SATA-Hard-Disk-Drive
 This is what they said when I asked about them testing it:

 Manufacturer Recertified from ServerPartDeals:

 Update: DO NOT buy from DiscTech's eBay store if you want their 1 year seller warranty. FYI

 This seems to validate the thoughts on Refurb vs Recertified

 I have scoured the internet for this and can't figure it out. Every guide on OAuth/OpenID with Authentik assumes I have full control of the application so I can setup the OpenID login on the other end. If I understand correctly, OpenID could be used on any site without any further configuration on my end, since I'm hosting an OpenID compatible server.

Lidarr then has to have read/write to the path on the NAS to move it. And now another container (Dev A2) or separate system (Device 3) needs access those files for playback?

I use this VM lab to do pen-testing, intrusion analysis, disk forensic analysis, and traffic analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have been running my Unraid server for over a year now, with no knowledge going into it. I have learned a few things along the way with the help of guides, forums and reddit. 
 Today I setup a reverse proxy so my friends could use Overseerr without exposing my IP address. It isn't that I didn't trust my friends, but mainly because my IP address changes so often from my IP that I didn't like getting messages that "it's broken". But I do know it is bad practice to let people know what your IP is.
 This is the first taste I have setting up a reverse proxy, though I setup Wireguard with Duck DNS to be able to access my server outside the network in the past.
 I believed I setup everything correctly in Nginx and applied the SSL certificate to the domain that was created for Overseerr. The only issue that I am running into is through Chrome I get an warning, "Deceptive site ahead". Edge and Firefox does not show this warning. After some googling people generally say that it is a Duck DNS problem, and after using no-ip to create a domain, it does appear that way as I get no warning when using the no-ip domain to access Overseerr. I don't want to use no-ip as you have to renew the domain every 30 days and I don't think I can set it up to automatically update my IP address when it changes (this could be a lack of knowledge). 
 I was wondering if there is a way to fix this issue. Currently I have Overseerr, Duck DNS, and Nginx all as dockers inside my Unraid server. 
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Everyone.
 ​
 Please allow me to introduce myself to the community.
 Hope you are having great end of 2022.
 ​
 I have moved to new place aiming to setup homelab at home for my career to playaround, learn, break, fix etc etc.
 ​
 I have telus 2.5g with pfSense and Unifi equipemnt.
 I ve been trying to follow these tutorials online.
 https://youtu.be/KVYcZNvq8os
 https://youtu.be/Omm2pQUJO0o
 ​
 I succeed in making Telus(ISP) modem to talk to pfSense.
 I am struggling to make UDM SE to talk to pfsense.
 I think I don't know what I am doing or video above assumes that I have existing knowledge and to follow the video.
 ​
 Currently, I have comptia A+ with limited knowledge about Networking. I am trying to learn and hopeing to get better understadning of networking.
 ​
 It seems like I need to create VLAN for both side of pfSense and UDM SE to make it talk since there is no such a thing as bridge mode in between.
 ​
 What am I doing wrong?
 ​
 Is there any cabling I need to improve?
 ​
 How do I turn off DHCP on UDM SE and let pfsense take full control of it?
 ​
 I am assuming that all the unifi device need to be re-adapted to network when it has internet?
 ​
 Please help, I know it's hot mass but any help much appreciated.
 ​
 Cheers,
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I wait for my storage to come in the mail I thought I'd ask what the typical size of a website archive is for a single domain. At the moment I'd only like to get 4 or 5 offline backups using HTTrack (mostly forums for niche things like video game mods or specific news sites etc.) Am I being overly generous in allotting ~20 GB per domain? Or maybe someone here has a worst case scenario of archiving a site that was super large?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I currently have an Unraid server, and if I am being honest, it meets most of my needs. I keep all my media / data on it, and run a few docker containers (Plex, radarr, sonarr). However, recently I have gotten myself worked up about data rot, and have decided I should really build a TrueNAS system with ZFS. 
 My thought is to build a low powered TrueNAS system that is just used for storage. I am thinking 6 8TB drives in a RAIDZ2 config. Then run a higher powered Proxmox system for my dockers and a few VM's. 
 Does this make the most sense? I know I can run docker with TrueNAS scale, but to be honest, I would rather just setup TrueNAS once and leave it alone. I know I can also run TrueNAS on a VM, but again, I don't think the idea of that.

 I need help choosing the best solution for storage. Either an external drive, something like the 8TB WD MyBook or getting an external HDD casing with a few hard drives inside it. Although the ones I found people complained about noise and overheating
 Anyone’s got some tips or recommendations regarding my choice?

 As it is now, everything is in a single docker-compose.yml file. Jellyfin, Navidrome, Audiobookshelf, Photoprism. Each of the services have a config file, and are given a folder in /config that only that service uses. 
 My thought was that I could make a folder in Home called "Apps", give each service a folder inside, and put the config folder next to the docker-compose.yml. This would allow me to only have to back up that "Apps". Probably with Syncthing. However, it would put everything in my home drive.
 Is there a best practice? Or anything else I'll need to consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I want to move my power consuming plex server to another machine, since it is running on a gaming machine right now. I was able to get a cheap Optiplex which seems to fit quite well for my use case. Problem I have now is, that I read, that the HBA cards are getting quite hot and in that Optiplex SFF won’t be to much space to provide proper cooling. At the beginning I was thinking of a new case (Nanoxia deep silence rev 6b to fit everything in one case), but with that Optiplex a case swap seems to be quite hard. Building the whole thing new from scratch would cost way more then use that Optiplex. Now I thought of getting a random tower put that HDDs in there connect them to a power supply and then link them to an LSI HBA 9200-16e which I would then plug into the Optiplex. Is the card going to be to hit then? Should I just leave the case of the Optiplex open and this will do the job? Or will it be better to just plug in USB Drives into the Optiplex?
 If building an external enclosure all I really need is that HBA card (it mode), a case, a usual power supply and the SAS to SATA cables, right? 
 Any other solution or ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SSDs are typically not seen as a good choice for cold storage because unpowered drives gradually lose their data. Consumer drives seem to be spec'ed for 1 year anyway and that spec is based on a pretty heavily used drive.
 How would you "refresh the charge" on a cold stored drive though? Is it as simple as plugging it into a power source (for how long?) or does the data actually need to be re-written? Does this require an OS to perform the task or does the drive firmware just handle it when it happens to have power?
 With a lot of drives going to SMR and SSDs going down in price I can sort of see a lot of backup tasks (certainly not all) migrating over to SSDs soon. It isn't clear to me how to work around their limitations in this space.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello selfhosted-Community,
 recently I started as a intern and I'm overwhelmed with my job because I'm a total noob in network technology. We have a product which is hosted externally. We only have a simple router here.
 The Services and the Reverse-Proxy should be running in Docker Containers on a Ubuntu machine. These services should be reachable with another devices on the local network via browser. I have read about resolving through Windows/Linux hosts.file but the examples I found are using only localhost. Is it possible to use this file for my constellation/usecase?
 Is it better to set up a DNS-Resolver? I think it could be problematic because everything in the office runs in one network. We are thinking of getting a firewall anyway and in case of need we would have an second old router to set 2 NATs but I'm afraid I won't have time to set everything up and trouble shoot because I have to do a long research again.

EAC works fine upon installation, recognizing my cd drive, going through the whole setup, and ripping CDs. But as soon as I close the application and start it back up I can't do anything. There is no CD drive to select and I can't rip CDs. I have had to uninstall and reinstall every time that Ive found a new CD I want to rip.
 Is there some EAC option I am missing, or does EAC just not like my drive? For reference my the CD drive I have as detected by EAC on installation is a TSSTcorpCDDVDW SH-224BB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all I work with very large 3d files, and I have upgraded an 10 year old synology nas to an Asustor lockerstor 4 gen2 with a Netgear GS108E-300PES switch, with 4 ssd of 2tb and 4 hdd of 12tb in RAID, I still do not buy NIC, so I have access only in 2.5gb.
 I hope someone can guide me, I don't know much about networks, but I'm here to learn:
  
Which NIC (not too expensive) do you recommend to use NAS at 5gbps, I work animations and 3d?
 With the Link aggregation of the switch, can I make the two 2.5gbps connections go to one 5gbps or 10gbps connection? but I bought the netgear one (I can still return the switch if I need another one).
 I have also seen another QNAP QSW-M2108-2C switch, which I don't know if it is better.
  I have four computers all they have 2.5g lan. 
 1 Workstation, 1 Renderfarm, 2 laptops.
 
  
I would be interested in future proofing this investment and then being able to have 10gbps for my computers and servers.
 Thank you all in advance .
 Edit: I made a mistake in the post the switch I have is the Netgear MS510TX-100EUS that have ports of 1gb, 2.5gb 5gb and 10gb rj45 + sfp. Thanks for the response!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to host some things like gitea and maybe other services in the future (mainly for privacy reasons).
 I was wondering what will be better: getting a physical server like Lenovo ThinkCenter or renting a VPS.
 From back of the napkin calculations—for the cost of the Lenovo ThinkCenter I can rent a VPS for almost 9 years, and it's not taking into account hardware replacements and electricity.
 I can't find any other pros for the physical server rather than my unhealthy obsession to own things rather than rent them. Obviously my calculations are based on hosting gitea for now, any other self-hosted service will double the price of VPS (unless multiple services can be hosted on the same instance).
 Appreciate your input.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past i used: - selfhosted openvpn with duckdns domain (forwarded ports) - selfhosted wireguard with duckdns domain (forwarded ports) - zerotier 
 I also have regular paid domain. My network is 500/30 Mbps (yes its 30 not 300)
 I need secure access to my NAS (Synology) from outside (and ONLY to NAS, not entire LAN). Currently i use Quickconnect but i want to use sync and SMB services and AFAIK QC is not secure enough for that.
 So i wonder what would be the best for me.
  
Tailscale/Zerotier - simplest but yet the slowest (?). Im reading this ... https://medium.com/netmaker/battle-of-the-vpns-which-one-is-fastest-speed-test-21ddc9cd50db
 
Sefhosted Wireguard - i set it up once, it should be faster. But is it relevant in my case since i have 500/30 internet? I mean those 30Mbps will limit the download speed anyway
 
Cloudhosted netmaker - more reliable than pt. 2 but easier. Also (theoretically) faster than 1. But I would have to get some cloud. Probably i would opt for Oracle Free Tier since AWS i only free for a year. But again, will speeds be so much better when my home internet is 500/30?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I'm starting to think that what I thought to be trivial might not be. 
 I'm looking for a service to do the following: 1. Automatically backup specific folders from 3 Android phones (photos, videos, documents) and from one Macbook. I want to be able to define which folders I want to backup. *so an Android app is really important. 2. The service will maintain the original structure, e.g. Phone 1 > Pictures > Camera. 3. To have the ability to determine who sees what. E.g. Phone 1 will only see Phone 1's data, Phone 2 only Phone 2, etc. 4. Nothing will be automatically downloaded to any device or synced between them (I don't want phone 1 data on Phone 2) 5. I will be able to access the data regularly (to view, download and share documents and pictures). 6. I'd like to rely on it to free up space on these mobile phones and potentially laptop. 7. If it's possible, I would also like to store some movies I downloaded over the years (some of them are old and harder to find, but if it's an issue with copyrights then I'll just store it offline) 8. Security and privacy, speed and pricing are important so outside US is better (I'm from EU). 9. I don't need more than 1TB for the upcoming years.
 I read too many (probably) paid reviews and on the other hand a lot of bad reviews, so I would love your help with figuring out what would be best for me.
 (Can't add more options to the poll)
  
Filen - 2TB $93 yearly
 Any other service that is better than what's listed

 I am planning to go paperless with paperless-ngx. I already have a docker setup where I can run the software with, but I am struggeling to find the right printer. All the scanners, that are recommended on the paperless repo seem to be quite expensive.
 Do you have recommendations wich scanner/all-in-one-printer does the job and is affordable (also buying a used one is an option). Being able to use duplex scanning and being able to scan multi-page documents would be important to me because I want to automate the incoming document flow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So z-lib going down prompted me to finally start to build a proper archival storage, which went quickly from raspberry Pi + usb external drives to planning for a full-fledged NAS.
 I planned to find a motherboard with 8 SATA ports, mainly eyeing ATX boards from ASrock, MSI etc in the $100-200 range targeting desktop builds. But asking around, experienced friends mentioned two things, 1) LSI card IT mode is a thing, therefore SATA port count does not matter too much, 2) apparently supermicro and decommissioned server boards exist (average pulled-not-refurbed offerings were on the higher end of my budget; not going to get any of the beefy ones).
 I start to hesitate whether to get an average desktop board and grab a LSI, or find a previously owned sm board. Searching in the subreddit, it seems both have been done, but I didn't see opinions of choosing between the two, although points have been made about whether it's good to get second hand motherboards. 
 I am comfortable with using HPC servers and have done some VPS self hosting for fun, but this is my first time to build and maintain a physical server. I have had no experience of using LSI.
 Is there any pitfalls to turn me away from either options? Any thoughts are appreciated.

I use bare drives as offline backup, and SAS drives tend to be a bit cheaper and have generally spent life in a climate-controlled, steady state and often are recycled out far before the drive has any problems. I've successfully used SAS drives for backups and temp storage for years now, and so far have had zero failures other than the rare case of a drive that came with bad sectors or other problems (like the ones I'm talking about here) already.
 NetApp drives are known for coming with 520 byte sectors, but those can usually be reformatted to 512 byte sectors with some sg_format magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this Christmas i want to do a little upgrade to my node 804 mini server. Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.
 CPU: AMD 5600X
 Desired setup:
  
2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0
 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.
 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot
 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.
  
Drive quantity:
  
8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.
 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.
 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.
  
So the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.
 I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.
 Thanks a lot for any guidance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically, I need something like mStream or Audioserve that you point at a folder and you can play the mp3s in it. Nothing fancy, I don't need tags, etc. something strictly folder-based. It also needs the ability to link directly to the file. Mousikofidi does this, but I need something for Windows (I know, I know...) Essentially Apache but prettier.
 Any suggestions? Am I overthinking it? Should I just find a file manager?

 I found a YouTube video showing how to download rumble videos ( here ) and the guy used a website called davapps. 
 I’m asking Reddit if this site is legit because I’m not a big tech guy and it seems almost too good to be true lol. I literally just copy-pasted the url and downloaded the video, it took 20 seconds. I went to the website, pasted the link, and boom downloaded. 
 I didn’t have to download any software, or spend hours researching about some long ass complicated process, none of that. Just website - paste link- boom downloaded to my computer. It’s so simple and easy I’m wondering if there’s some nefarious catch, or if it’s totally legit. 
 I can’t find any posts about anyone using this website, everyone just uses YouTube dl or has some super long complicated process. 
 Has anyone used Davapps to download videos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there-
 I recently set up a VPS to host a database and a python scraper. I route all requests through a paid proxy that rotates through IPs to ensure my scrape requests don't get blocked/throttled. Currently scraping a mixture of Amazon & Google pages, but want to potentially expand.
 Now that I've finished configuring all of that, I started thinking about attempting to host my own proxy service instead of using a paid one. Here are some of my thoughts:
  
Starting to get close to monthly data caps on current proxy plan
 I've used SQUID in the past, so that part isn't daunting to me, also read that it can be configured to rotate through IPs.
 I love technology and typically self-host whenever I can.
 Guessing this could be cheaper and/or more flexible?
  
I do have a few questions though -- 
  
I'm guessing I'd need a VPS with 5+ ip addresses. Which VPS providers allow that and have cheap plans? 
 Any idea how many IPs I would need for something like this?
 
 Is setting up my own proxy service worth it? Can it be cheaper?
  
Looking forward to hearing others' thoughts/advice. Thank you for the help!

It was 1.2.1 and I upgraded it to 1.4.0 just by pulling the new images and ran those. Everything seemed to work fine, but being rather new to docker, I was wondering if the SQL schema upgrade happens automatically? I thought you had to upgrade the database before running the new images, but for the life of me, could not find definitive info through my Google-Fu (which may be weak). Even the 2FA java plugin just worked fine. 
 I looked through the docker logs of both new containers, but didn't see anything where any schema upgrade scripts were run. So, just wondering before I do the same to my production containers if this is how it is done.
 Thanks - appreciate the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: Is it possible to create a backup image of a cloud server so I can use the image to re-run the server on a local physical computer on my network?
 Some years ago, I bought a cloud server from a local company for 3$ a month and installed Wordpress with some of their automated scripts to build a small shop. 
 I'm not using the shop that much anymore and I thought of turning it off, but I don't want to lose that data just in case in the future I want to reuse it again. The thing is that the company charges for storage used even if the server is turned off.
 So I was wondering what could I use to make an entire backup of the whole server and copy it to my computer? 
 Ideally it would be great if I could make some kind of whole-computer-backup or something that allows me to kind of create an "image" or something and in the future re-install the image in another computer and have exactly the server as it was (but on my local network for example). 
 The thing is, since it's a cloud server, I don't know if that's even possible?
 Thanks in advance for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've recently tried to integrate authentik for my various services to help secure them behind some authentication, but I am running into some weird behavior (namely 500 and 502 errors).
 I have all containers tied to a custom network, docker_prod, so I am able to use container names in NPM rather than relying on changing port numbers. This works fine for just launching the apps from NPM, but seems to cause issues w/ Authentik.
 I followed this tutorial to setup Authentik and I was able to get it working the first time, but haven't had luck since. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I seem to flip flop between 500 and 502 errors.
 I've looked up and down for more documentation, or youtube tutorials, but it doesn't seem like other folks are running into this same issue.
 I also do not understand the terminology despite reading the instruction - provider? outpost?
 My need is (hopefully) simple - I'd like to add authentication in front of applications that do not have it natively built in. As a future step, I'll integrate 2FA via Google Auth.
 Can someone ELI5? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering upgrading my server from it's current setup (an old Macbook Pro and a 5th gen NUC) to an 8th gen Proliant Microserver. I really like the form factor of the Proliant and am not sure I have the space for a rack server. I'm just not sure a maxed out Proliant will be sufficient upgrade from my current setup. Current specs:
 Macbook (running Arch): - i7-3720QM @ 2.60GHz 4 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 5681 - 16 GB RAM
 NUC: - i5-5250U @ 1.60GHz 2 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 2493 - 4 GB RAM
 A maxed out Proliant would have the following specs:
 HPE Proliant Microserver 8th Gen (maxed out): - Xeon E3-1290 v2 @ 3.7 GHz 4 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 6470 - 16 GB RAM
 I'm not sure that it's worth replacing my two current machines with this one machine. I'd really like to get a Xeon with at least 12 threads but I think I'll either need to go rack mount or a standard tower (or build my own). The Macbook handles the heavier workloads (Frigate, Nextcloud, and a Mac VM).
 I'm kinda just basing my estimations on Passmark scores but I know that doesn't tell the full story. What are your guys' thoughts? Would this upgrade be worth it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently in the process of switching my home server from a Raspberry Pi 4 to a 2012 Mac Mini, and am not sure how to go about it. My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. 
 As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini. I know that mac has limited ext4 support, but I'd prefer to run the drives in a mac-native (still cross-platform) file system. 
 So my questions are:
  
What filesystem would work best in this case? I have heard good things about exfat, and it seems like a good cross-platform option. I am also open to APFS.
 How best can I go about migrating my data onto the new filesystem? Is there a tool that can do this?
 As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.
  
Thanks!

I want to travel overseas for about 4-5 weeks to oversee a different project of my own (construction related). The problem I am having is that even though I asked my supervisor he wouldn't agree to let me travel abroad.
 I have been trying to find a way to set up an openvpn server at home, preferably something not too complicated. I need to be able show my home IP address and it has to be a standalone device that I can simply plug to my router. Also, I cannot use a VPN as pretty much all VPN IP's are blacklisted by my company and I automatically receive a warning message.
 I could setup an unattended computer with teamviewer/anydesk but I am looking for something more reliable. A friend suggested to buy a Mikrotik router and plug it in my home router as there is an option to create an openvpn server. After some research I found out that some other routers have the same option as well. Pfsense seemed like a decent idea too. However, the problem I am having is that my home router changes it's IP address every 1-2 weeks or so. I asked my ISP for a static IP but that feature is only for business customers. Any ideas on how to get around that?

 I travel for work and want the ability to access my Home lab on the road. I understand SSH and VPNs and am running both OpenVPN and Wireguard. However my company says that I cannot install any client VPN software on my work laptop. (Intel 13" MacBook Pro)
 Ideally I would like remote CLI and web access, but could live with the latter only. I have two solution ideas.
  
Bring another tablet or laptop that does run VPN software (Heavy!)
 Bring an external router like a glinet device that can transparently provide VPN access (Less heavy but more annoying)
  
Does anyone else have any other suggestions on how to tackle this? I would even be okay with some kind of VPN that runs only in a browser.
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm spinning my wheels deciding how I want to accomplish some local name resolution. I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.
 I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say "home.laxweasel" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.
 I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.
 However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.
 Thoughts/experiences? Anyone want to point me in a good direction?

 Hey, long time lurker here.
 I've been messing around with proxmox and networking for quite a bit on the side of my studies on my old desktop computer. I have been dreaming of setting up a system like this one for quite some time and decided to draw it out and ask this community for any recommendations on upgrades to achieve this, tips on starting a first proper homelab, or just overall thoughts on my setup. 
 Any and all discussions are welcomed. Thank you.

 Now here's my stupid noob question: How do you guys use your machines? Do you all have simpler PC-like machines on your desks and connect via RDP, VNC or else?
 It feels like I'm missing a piece of the puzzle here

 I tried the following in the Windows command line:
 C:\wgetdown>wget -r -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png -e robots=off https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/shopping/beauty-perfume 
 which returned the following error:
  
OpenSSL: error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure
 Unable to establish SSL connection.
  
and then replaced https with http:
 C:\wgetdown>wget -r -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png -e robots=off http://www.harrods.com/en-gb/shopping/beauty-perfume 
 which returned the same error.
 I am sure there's something I am missing, any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm setting up a home server rack with equipment (POE-enabled switch, router, NAS, two USFF PCs) drawing ~600w of power.
 I'm looking for a reliable rack-mounted power-conditioning PDU with surge protection and was initially thinking about a UPS. The $500+ UPSes I'm seeing are a little too rich for my blood, especially since I care less / not at all about the UPS' uptime benefits and primarily about protection benefits from a PDU and surge protector.
 This is for a home network -- I'm a tinkerer, not a network engineer looking to replicate an enterprise environment.
 Two questions -
  
Am I thinking about this the right way?
 Is there a reliable < $200 power-conditioner PDU + surge protection solution without UPS folks would recommend that would meet my needs?

 Lets say i got a server with 24 internal disks (where all the data is stored that needs to be accessible 24/7) and a jbod thats just used for backups for like 1 or 2 hours every couple days (two separate zfs pools).
 How is truenas going to behave if the jbod is powered off and when needed powered on again?

 I think the best way to get an advice for this is to just detailing what i have and i want.
 What i have? - 3 external hdd (4tb WD easy storage, 2tb seagate, 1tb wd my passport) the first one has a power cable and usb cable to be able to connect to my pc, the others only use an usb cable.
 What i want? Access to all the data stored on those hdd’s via my pc or my phone (i want to watch videos stored on those hdd’s without having to connect them to my pc first)
 So basically a personal cloud made of a bunch of hdd external drives.
 I’m sorry if i explain everything like a child but is just that i’m very noob at this kind of things

 I have downloaded some videos from Panopto. Unfortunately, they are split between audio and video files; all files are MP4.
 Do you know of any simple application to use to join and sync the audio and the video? I have tried OpenShot but it freezes up.
 Would it be easier to convert the audio in MP4 to MP3 before joining them?

 There are many NAS options out there, but I don't want RAID or JBOD or any NAS operating system. I want to have each drive in the enclosure as a separate drive in Windows, like they are now.
 Technically, the enclosure should only include a power adapter, some coolers and a USB hub. Does something like this exist?

 I'm looking for tips on naming folders like: "College > Classes > Calculus > Tests" etc. so very fine organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey !
 For months, I've been looking for an open source travel tracker. I'm looking for something like Polar steps.
 For this I could use whether my mobile phone or a gps tracker to send my GPS position to some third party. Then I need that this third party has an public API then I can get my data.
 Have you ever heard about an gps tracker with an public API ? Or a similar project ?
 Links : - https://www.polarsteps.com/
 Thank you :)
 Edit : This is the closest tag I found, excuse me if it's not the right one

 I am a Matt, a developer of ExpressACC, which is a ‘Family’ Time Tracking system, and hopefully an added Task Management system in the future, that I created for my kids. This allows them to be able to track their time left for the day that they can have on their devices/screens.
 Backstory: We have many devices through the house including TVs, Consoles, Phones, Tablets, etc… There are many built-in device tools (like iOS Screen Time), but they don’t take into account devices outside their ecosystem. This meant that I had to regulate their times individually, and we can have up-to 5 children at a time from 7 to 14 years old at home. This is when I decided to come up with a simple time tracking app, and they love it more than me telling them it’s time to get off their devices. T…]]></summary>

 In July, I bought 25GB Verbatim M Discs from Amazon. Even though I bought them directly from Amazon Europe, the discs I received were not real M Discs but regular Verbatim BD-Rs with an organic layer that were made to look like M Discs. I noticed right away because the MID of the discs was VERBAT-IMe-000, which is the code for their regular BD-Rs, instead of MILLEN-MR1-000 which is the MID that all 25GB M Discs have. At this point I assumed I'd been sold fakes, but 3 months later I again ordered Verbatim M Discs, this time from German retail chain Saturn, and once again received these discs that I assumed are fakes.

 ​
 I am product repping for a small company and would like to track what samples I have, and when I send samples to customers. I would also like an easy way for customers to place orders, and then for both the customer and me to be able to track the order status, including tracking shipping.
 ​
 Helpdesk & Ticketing system as well as email management would be a nice bonus, but are not required.
 ​
 Does this product exist? Or do I need to build it myself? I would be happy to open-source it if it is something I need to develop, and would appreciate any help people were willing to give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Traefik as my reverse proxy and really find that once setup it is super powerful, but I found a few issues with the direct docker integration so created a tool to try make it simpler for me, and think it may make life easier for others.
 https://github.com/qwacko/traefik-config-gen
 The key issues I wanted had were:
  
Integration with docker containers on other hosts requires docker swarm.
 I felt that I was forever creating the same 8-10 labels on every container to make them work (but having to rename a bunch and hopefully make no errors).
  
Possibly there are different ways to solve these issued, but I created a tool that effectively hooks into the HTTP Provider that Traefik provides, and reads docker labels to generate a configuration based on a user defined template for Traefik to use. 
 This doesn't make the setup of Traefik any easier (you need a working system in order for this to work), but once setup, this should save a bunch of time keeping every new container functioning correctly and consistently no matter which host you add it to. I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.
 This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.

 I'd like to know if there is a way i can backup this system so that i can "easily" restore it to a working state.. I'm talking accounts, passwords, services, data.. the whole shebang...
 I consider myself fairly literate when it comes to linux but i'm by no means an expert.. I run proxmox in several locations and am more than happy with snapshots / backups in that arena.. but when it comes to a baremetal restore i'm lost..
 I understand i'd need to at a minimum reinstall the bare OS.. but is there some way i can then restore things to how it was at my last backup?

However, I would like to get 1-2 more hard drives, routinely copy the data onto them, but keep them in stored away. However, I have also heard that even when not used, hard drives can "rot" or rust, leading to the information inside being at risk of being destroyed. Therefore, should I even be replacing these hard drives every few years? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.

Once I graduted to docker, NC was among the first services I spun up, again. I'm using the stable branch and it has been rock-solid so far. NC apps made it extremely easy to try new things and I discovered many useful services to self-host which I would never even have attempted otherwise. Thanks to NC, I did use at some point, at least temporarily:

 I'm searching for an online backup solution. All these 'lifetime' packages kinda freak me out since lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of the product and nothing else.
 To explain further my 'sidehustle' is photography and well, it takes up a lot of space. Currently I'm using backblaze to backup my stuff, but I hate the retrival they offer and the fact that the service works kinda slow (my line is 3/3gbit and the upload never goes over 150mbit).
 So I'm currently trying out iDrive (since it was dirt cheap like 4eur / year for 10TB). Works fine for the price, the file retrival is better, but they don't offer sufficient storage capacity for me.
 Any other services out there that will not break the bank and will work?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Currently I need 60TB of storage

 TLDR. I have a site running on an old CMS(MySQL, PHP) I want to turn it into static HTML, CSS.
 I have a website running on an old very niche CMS that is no longer maintained. I want to self host the contents but don't need the dynamic features and I don't want to deal with trying to maintain PHP and MySQL services. So I want to convert it static HTML and CSS. 
 I'm looking for recommendations on tools to do the conversion. Tools that run on Windows are preferred. 
 Happy to answer questions.

 Recently I have gotten into archival, and wanted to tart archiving lots of science and tech magazines.
 Currently I use calibre-web to organize them as follows:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/zfokxfsfglz91.png?width=2533&format=png&auto=webp&s=04aabc50224958c08b6938f0758c9c152543480f
 However there are a few problems with this method.
 1: Since they are PDFs, my download managers will flag them on desktop breaking the web reader.
 2: There is no way to read the PDFs on my phone for some reason. I can't import them into the books app without a PC and that ruins half the point.
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions or alternatives please let me know, and have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.
 I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.
 I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?
 Is it also worth looking into other file systems? I just use normal ext4, but I've heard people talk about using ZFS instead, but I don't know much about it.
 Thanks in advance!

 I’ve since switched my pihole to docker on synology using the synology’s ip (not macvlan). Pihole is registering local up’s but it seems like the tailscale queries from multiple devices are registering as “localhost” (127.0.0.1). 
 Can I change this or do I have to deal with it?

It will have very low traffic (likely <100 visits per month), I will probably like to build it with Wordpress or something similar with moving to html/css/js later down the road. It really just is a page displaying content about my business. Nothing fancy.
 ​
 1). Should I host my website within a VM (on my local pc) or is there really no point / no security risk? Assuming that I only allow http(s) connections, there isn't much room for security concerns right?
 2). What software do yall recommend for hosting? Reading the guides on this sub, I can't really decide between them, nothing stands out. I'm leaning towards apache because there seems to be quite a few YouTube guides for it and seems well documented.
 3). Is there anything I should know before getting into this? I'm working as a sysadmin so if theres anything technical I should know, or certain software that is common in production, anything is helpful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing a little research on attempting to accomplish deploying a FOG server for backing up my OS installs (I distro hop quite a bit) so I can redeploy them easily if wanted. My environment is setup like this. I use Proxmox VE and have an AdGuard Home server deployed on it. My AGH server is my DHCP server as well. What I would like to do (or thinking what would be the route to take) is setup another interface on my PVE server for PXE booting and attach that and my LAN interface to my FOG server that I will build on my PVE server. Just not sure how to go about it and have PXE requests pull IPs from the FOG server and all other DHCP requests pull from AGH. Or is that even possible? Completely new to this and just playing it out in my head right now of how I see it working. Or, where and how to I configure AGH to work with the FOG server in that my nodes will be able to PXE boot to the FOG server without breaking normal DHCP functionality for normal operations. 
 Thanks in advance for any and all direction on how to accomplish this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.
 In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.
 Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).
 I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.
 TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running nginx inside a podman pod with port 1234 piped to port 80. Also on my machine is another service listening on port 9090. How can I make it so that any machine connecting to say $my-domain:1234/service gets served by the service listening on port 9090?
 I know I CANT set location /service to proxy_pass to http://127.0.0.1:9090 because 127.0.0.1 here refers to the pod running nginx (in particular, it isnt running the service I want to connect to). 
 I thus tried to proxy_pass to http://$host-local-ip:9090 where $host-local-ip is something like 192.168.x.x, but now when I try to connect from a machine (call it A) outside the network, it seems nginx tries to service the requests from 192.168.x.x on the same network as machine A. Is there a way to fix this?

 I was wondering if you run BGP routers in your homelab (or publicly) announcing IP address spaces and have insights into your journey? Particularly I would like to know what software you chose for the different components (announcements, peering, RPKI, …), if you faced any problems that one could avoid, and insights in resource usage (cpu, memory, bandwidth).

 I did install netdata but I am iffy about it.
 Things I wish to keep an eye on: - ZFS pool health - Physical hard disk failures - Filesystem errors (btrfs, zfs) - Snapraid-btrfs monitoring - Cronjobs monitoring - Disk spin-up / spin down (total time asleep vs. on). I run 'hd-idle' tool and there are log entries in syslog that I could use I guess to graph something?
 My notification preferences is Pushover, or at worst e-mail but open to a tool that does something else. Primarily I wanted to keep things very simple (zabbix is an example of a complex beast I am trying to avoid).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a single home server running all of my Docker services that is only accessible via LAN/VPN. I'm interested in high availability in case my server, internet, or power go down. I travel often to two other locations where I can place servers. How difficult is this to set up, and what do I need to learn?
 Do the servers need to have the same hardware, or can I mix and match across Linux servers and Raspberry Pis? 
 Docker Swarm seems dead. Kubernetes seems too complicated. Is Nomad the right orchestration tool for bringing this all together?
 Sounds like I will also need WireGuard/Tailscale so that all of the servers can communicate from different networks since I do not want them exposed to the public internet. 
 What else am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.
 So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .
 But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :
 https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms
 Or you could go back to X86.
 Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.
 You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.
 Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for "pfsense router".

 This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. 
 What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to repurpose an old TV box I have lying around into a homeserver, as a way to play around, get started into self hosting and be able to familiazire myself with concepts, etc.
 I am having an issue with Docker though, where I get the following error every time I run sudo docker run for any container (even hello-world):
 bash docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime failed: runc create failed: cgroup namespaces aren't enabled in the kernel: unknown. ERRO[0001] error waiting for container: context canceled 
 I believe the issue happens because I am, for compatibility reasons, using an old kernel 4.4.194 that does not support Cgroup V2.
 Is there a way to tell docker to switch to Cgroups V1? If not, os there anything else I can do to be able to get docker working on the machine? The homeserver will not be exposed to the internet, and security is not a priority.

I want to have a "screensaver" type website showing random videos that I can have in the background while I exercise. Optionally, I'd like to jump through random videos in 30 second snippets. Kind of like the old school Winamp visualizers, but with videos I downloaded (like gaming speedruns and random 3D stuff).
 Is there a self hosted app for this? I use Plex and Jellyfin, but those aren't really suited for this. The research I did brought up some live streaming software, which is not the goal, though I guess I can hack together a script or something in conjunction with one of those. 
 Why I'm not just using VLC media player: Because this approach is more interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I've been attempting to build myself a homelab, with a proper server, alongside my TL-SG108E, Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) and Pi Zero v1.3.
 I recently came across this server on Facebook Marketplace (for 200 EUR):
  
HP ProLiant DL360p Gen 8 
 2x Xeon E5-2630 (6c/12t per CPU) @ 2.3 GHz
 64 GB ECC RAM
 Quad 1 GB NIC
 Raid Controller (changed to HBA) - 120 GB SSD + 2x 300 GB 10K SAS
 
  
I had a friend tell me that they wouldn't get this stating that its a Gen 8 the processor, the specs, and RAM are low. But the issue is I am on a budget for a server (so I can create projects, AD environment, etc. (for testing, as I work in security)). I am wondering if the server is worth the price for a beginner/first server. I plan to run Proxmox and spin up pfSense and other stuff that might help with network segmentation, etc.
 Additionally, the seller offered to install a clean version of Windows Server 2016 and give me remote RDP access and ILO access to check the specs out. I plan on using Hard Disk Sentinel to get an idea about the disks' state and health, but what else should I do to make sure the server is solid (without defects, etc.) before purchase?
 I'd sincerely appreciate any help.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks first time on this sub as I have a question about external harddrives and it looks like im going to have to buy one now. Can anyone reccomend a good affordable externel wireless harddrive where i can store and play a 4k or 6k movie wirelessly thorough my laptop. I dont know if all external hardrives can do this or if I need specific ones. If anyone has any suggestions for hardrives id love to hear them . I'm looking for something in the 4-6TB range and willing to spend maybe 200 (ideally less though). 
 any help is much appreciated thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two HPE LTO8 drives in an HPE MSL2024 library.
 Sometimes when I mount them, they mount as \\\\.\\TAPE0 and \\\\.\\TAPE1 and sometimes they mount as \\\\.\\TAPE1 and \\\\.\\TAPE2. 
 They're both on Fiber Channel, on SCSI 5/0.0.0 and 6/0.0.0. I thought it's supposed to be that the lower SCSI ID should be TAPE0 (or the lower path), but that doesn't happen either. Either 5/0.0.0 or 6/0.0.0 can mount as TAPE0, TAPE1 or TAPE2.
 I can see no pattern to why they mount one way or the other. 
 The issue is, if there are two tapes in there, I don't know which drive has which tape. So I have to spin up a tape and then go look on StoreEver Command View to see which drive goes active, and I can't reliably automate anything.
 Is there any way to predict or control this?
 The controller is a QLogic QLE2562-CK 8GB Dual Port Fiber Channel, running on an EPYC 7262. Windows Server Essentials 2019. Drives are 2x HPE Q6Q67A.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The time has come to expand my storage...I'm running MergerFS/snapraid on a Lenovo TS140(i3-4130 CPU), and I've used up all 5 SATA ports on it...so I'm looking for recommendation of a HBA card. All I really need is a bunch of SATA data ports(I can upgrade PSU if I run out of SATA power cable).
 Google and my old memory seems to suggest an old LSI 9211-4i/8i flashed to IT mode would be enough. I'm not well-versed in the details of what features are beneficial for my need though - I don't need hardware RAID, but does caching help with access speed? Is there any other model (possibly more modern?) that's worth looking into?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a Oracle DC-24C shelf which I understand is very similar that the Netapp DS4246. 
 I read in another thread that swapping the power supply by a DELTA TDPS-580BB A 580W would result in less noise (and power consumption).
 So, I got the power supplies, but they ramp up to max fan speed all the time (I only have 4 HDDs installed). That is very noisy (~80dB@1m).
 The original power supplies ramp up to max at start up and then they slow down *a lot*. Resulting in about 45 dB@1m.
 I read in another thread that "It is possible to update the PCMs with less aggressive fan speed profiles. The IOMs have their own copy which they push to the PCMs on power up."
 So, any ideas? 
 Thanks!

I'd settle for two ports right now since that is what we need immediately, but soon we'll need to add four M.2 SSDs for some of those servers. I need forty of these cards so I don't want to make a mistake.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up a used Netapp FAS 26xx series rack mounted box from a liquidated company. Unfortunately, I did not research the device well enough and found its software is stuck behind a paywall. Being new to this device I am checking to see if anyone has a way to reconfigure the box to just be a stand alone disk shelf for home lab/backups. 
 ​
 Model# NAJ-1501
 12x 1.8TB SAS drives
 Dual controllers preinstalled
 All needed connector cables for the controllers
 If any additional information is needed about the box let me know, again first time posting here and first time using this type of device. 
 ​
 Any help is appropriated and if the answer is nope that's fine as well, just need to know if this is a brick to toss or not.

 Any suggestions for reasonable prices? I know it's all subjective of course, but I want to find something reasonable and of course I have to get the data uploaded/online. I have 1g/30mb so uploads mostly suck more than just basics. Also, I would say I have a moderate need to be able to access the files. Some drives I access daily, others weekly, still others seldom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just searched this sub for options on verifying backups and nearly all of them are a script or tool that the person runs manually, and nearly all of them assume network-share level access to the data.
 I'm exploring using services like Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2 for an off-site portion of my backup strategy. There is a "free tier" of free "transactions" (like executing an upload or download) and then you get charged for further calls. Additionally, ease of access to these tools often means implementing their API.
 Does anyone know of a tool, script, application on GitHub, or whatever that maybe does some or all of the following?
  
Runs periodically - once a day? Week?
 Provides some sort of report - an email would be nice. Or a dashboard? Something.
 Randomly selects a subset of files. If I have 5000 files, maybe it randomly picks 1%, or 50 of them.
 Uses a cloud-service API to download or run checks against the hosted files. Bonus points for supporting multiple services.
 Does a checksum or some other means to verify the integrity.
  
I think going for a random, small subset of files introduces some risk, but I can tolerate that risk.

 Thought there was perhaps a script that somebody already made for this exact purpose? I'm not good enough at Googling to find it if it does.

 Today sadly my WD RED 4TB drive failed. I got noticed by NAS. I thought that there might be sth minor, but when I got home I checked again and it really died.
 I check the warranty and it expired on October, 22nd.
 That's my 2nd WD Red which failed shortly after the warranty expired. The first one was 3TB WD RED.
 So, I'm thinking to switch into Seagate Ironwolf. Thoughts? Maybe 6TB.
 EDIT:
 I have a Synology DS218+. 2x 4TB WD RED drives were bought in late summer 2019.
 I uploaded some images. Do you see them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large refurbished Dell server 3.5 inch hard drive, but a problem finding USB enclosures for it. Some of my docks don't seem to have enough power to run it, as the drive randomly shuts down (this is especially apparent in my hot swap dock, where with the enterprise drive running, if I try to plug in a drive in the other slot, the entire device turns off and restarts as the new drive tries to spin up). I know it's a problem with the enclosure because the drive works fine as an internal drive running off a normal computer SATA power cable. Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.
 Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures? Can anyone recommend a good model with both enough power and never sleeps the drive?

 I am running it inside a vm with 8vcore and 16g ram and resource usage is under 5% according to htop. Network should also be more than enough. 
 Is this normal? Are the videos out of the box directly streamed from yt or over proxy/tor?

 I have my sub domain names pointing to duckdns, which points to my home ip address to nginx proxy manager, which then points to the appropriate docker.
 I have the stock ISP router CODA 4582.
 It's just annoying to jump from ip address to domain name depending on if I'm home or not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got some free hardrives from work, as they were gonna be sold and we did not need them anymore. I just picked a few and I realized that some are pretty old, with the oldest being 11 years old. I will run some tests when I have time, but regarding their age, how bad is it? I know harddrives can just fail whenever and a backup is always necessary, but i'm just curious.
 I'll maybe use these drives as my use copy and buy a new big one as back-up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build a NAS to house my movie library. I currently have 2 WD 16 TB hard drives hooked up to the two USB ports of an Nvidia Shield Pro, which houses a Plex Media Server that uses the hard drives as a library (although I use Kodi to play because Plex sucks on this platform for some reason). 
 I am trying to build a really simple NAS that can house 8-10 sata drives (ironwolf pro or exos) and maybe have a RAID setup. The Nvidia will do the heavy lifting as far as streaming and transcoding. So I could use some help looking at hardware. 
 I think the motherboard seems like the best place to start, then find the right CPU. What are some solid, cheap motherboards with a good amt of SATA ports (8+)? What form factor should I be looking for? I think I want to go with AMD since it seems cheaper and I don't need a ton of power. Any other advice that will help me future proof this setup is greatly appreciated!

 Recently moved into my first home and wired it with CAT6 cable. I'm finally done with consumer-grade routers and devices that need to be reset every couple of weeks. It's not much and I don't really know what I'm doing but it's been my favorite home project so far.
 Next I'll need to find a short NAS like the RS1221+ to use for storage and as a media server (recommendations welcome) and after that I'll look into building a box to run VMs... I can see myself sinking what's left of my disposable income into this stuff for a couple of months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi y'all,
 I work for a small business and we do regular print jobs for agents who we (the office admins) then charge at the end of the month. We've always kept a little paper binder to record the print jobs, quantity, what it's for, who it's for, and the cost per page, etc. I was wondering if there was some sort of open source self-hosted software for print logging/tracking/management or whatever you call it. 
 I'd like to have the ability for admins to filter by agent or job and then print a report at the end of the month to charge them, so we don't have to add it up ourselves by the end of the month. I'd also like to have it specify who it's for, who the log was recorded by, basically exactly what our booklet does. Is there something like that out there? Would I be better off just making some sort of sort of shared spreadsheet lol?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was previously running Nginx in a Docker container before. The Nginx container, as well as the rest of my other containers, all shared a Docker network called common. Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.
 Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.
 However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).
 This is what I've tried so far:
 ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;
 server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } 
 }
 server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;
 server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server "the-container-name"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } 
 } ```
 The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?
 I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.
 I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon everyone!
 So, I could be blind so please... Do not shoot me!
 I am currently looking for a self-hosted "Development" tracking software to self-host on my own home network that I can setup and allow certain people to access, update, maintain notes, concepts, media, etc. So far, I have seen a few sites and services that are "paid" but I would much prefer to self-host for more control over data, etc.
 I came across "Nuclino" to which honestly isn't pricy to have access to each month but, still this is a paid "Cloud Host" service.
 My question is, does anyone know of something out there that is similar to the example provided below? (Nuclino Screenshot)
 Nuclino Dashboard - Tracking & Media
 So far, the only thing I seem to find is more of a "Media" tracker solution that allows you to mark what you have watched, played, etc.
 Any suggestions and/or ideas are greatly appreciated. I would prefer to not use a spreadsheet or word document to track info. Gets very tedious and jumbled. lol

However, I don't want to just use it for nothing, and I'm sure there's some good stuff I can preserve here and there that's between 4.5-5TB. If you had this space, and could choose stuff to put on it that's not media, what would you put?

 Settings Editor
 Major changes in this release
  
Added a built-in settings editor
 Included settings.sample.json that auto-creates settings.json if it doesn't exist (but doesn't overwrite existing settings.json)
 Changed .html pages to .php (please delete your existing index.html file if you're already using Dasherr)
  
Like I've said before, Dasherr is a learning project for me, and also a way to give back something to this sub that has helped me for 1+ year of creating and maintaining my own selfhosted homeserver (still makes me proud every time I pass by and look at it)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've searched through and couldn't find a recent answer to this question, and I know things change all the time so here we go again!
 I have a load of DVD's and Blu-Ray's that are just taking up room because we don't have a player anymore.
 Some of these films and TV Series aren't available on streaming platforms (for example the BBC's version of "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" from 1988 or "Five Children and It" from 1991!) so we want to make them available to watch again.
 I'm more than happy with ripping them to storage, but I've no idea which media server to use.
 In the past, I've run Plex and that was fine, but I don't really need 90% of the features it offers.
 I already have subscriptions to Amazon, Netflix, Now, Disney+, and probably a couple of others, so it really is just to serve up these DVD rips so I can pack the DVD's away in the loft.
 It seems the choice is between Plex (good for beginners, not particularly flexible), Jellyfin (seems to be mainly used by those who torrent?), and Emby (not sure what the difference is between this and Jellyfin other than the name, I do know it's a fork though!).
 If you were in my situation, what would you use?

 I really want to get in to the home lab game and getting something like an R420 is compelling to me other than the fact that it pulls down somewhere between 100-200 watts even at idle. That said, I know very little about hardware so I don't even know where to begin to look for something that would be closer to what I'm looking for. I hope some of you fine people can point me in the right direction!
 I'm looking to run the *arr apps with jellyfin, opnsense, pihole, home assistant, and have some room for doing little projects in docker/k8s.

I am assuming the dmarc would need to go into a switch before going out to multiple modems. Essentially turning the switch into the "Super WAN"?

 I am looking for a selfhosted solution/application that may help in capturing details of products, services etc and help in visually comparing them. Use case: when you are on a fence and don't know what to buy you take a spreadsheet and make columns with Pros and Cons and then still scratch your head. A web app may be more helpful in this regard, especially if it allows collaboration with other people.
 If no such selfhosted web application is coming to mind, even a standalone desktop application suggestions will be appreciated.

 I’m planning to buy an external hard drive to use sometimes, not to be always plugged to PC.
 I’ve read some reviews here on Reddit about WD and it seems people don’t quite like them, saying something about the USB connection being problematic if I understand correctly..
 It’s just that they are cheaper than the Seagate drives from example, and I wonder if it should be fine to the “average” user - I mean it would suffice if it will just work as intended without failing suddenly.
 Thanks in advance.

 PS: For the email side I don't know which solutions would be good.

The main trick seemed to be to make sure one downloaded and used the Dell OEM VMware edition of the ISO, not the regular one. That seemed to provide all the drivers needed. It is absolutely unsupported processor, and it says so, but it will let you run. I've got mainly Windows 2016 servers as VM's and Win10 desktops running on it. Anyway, thought people might be interested as there are a ton of them on EBay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously on r/homelab: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/yftmqy/ups_battery_advice/
 Since that post I've submitted a work order to my apartments about the electical wiring in the apartment. It has yet to be addressed.
 Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.
 In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:
  
The UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.
 The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.
  
I'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.
 Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.

 Issues:
 - Screenshots are processed with twitter login-to-view popup, which blocks the rendered screen and ruins the screenshots too.
 - I know these popups can be avoided by using json authentication and excluding elements using javascript , (I don't have programming skills, don't have twitter API as well)
 Goals:
 I want to scrape a public twitter account using a bot that crawls for new tweets and screenshots them as soon they are posted. (Media content is not necessary, just screenshot of tweet is fine).
 I know there are other tools available that save tweets as CSV, JSON but I am looking for Visual/screenshots. 
 Suggestions are welcome.

 Thanks in advance. I've been looking for 2 days with no luck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 I have a question for you who are surely more experienced than me about collecting data: I would need to download all the images on this site (www.antweb.org) for a project I am working on (as well as for data hoarding, of course ;D). Could you illustrate a way to do this automatically (or at least semi-automatically)?
 Ideally, I would like to be able to download all the images related to a single ant genus (e.g., all those on this page "https://www.antweb.org/browse.do?subfamily=myrmicinae&genus=messor&rank=genus") into a single folder, and then do the same with the other genera I need.
 Can you tell me if there is a program or something similar that can help me in this endeavor? Or am I doomed to download all the images I need one by one, manually?
 Thank you for your help!

 I've set up a free cloudflare account to refuse a few self hosted apps to friends and family. The connectivity is there, but I'm struggling to see how I should go about restricting access to only those users/devices that I want to allow. I had assumed there would be some sort of supplicant app to install on the users devices that I could then authorise from within the dashboard but I can't see anything like this.
 Please could someone point me in the right direction?
 My Google Fu has yielded not much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. 
 Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).
 So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?

 A situation just came up where I wanted to gather photos from several family members into one shared album. I wound up doing it via Apple as it was easy to just send a link to everyone but I was wondering how a true self hoster would deal with this. I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. 
 Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with. Uploading to photoprism via WebDAV is intuitive and works from phones or computers
 Feel free to ignore my options and just suggestion your own.

In this way I can just do a "sneakernet" to this player from my NAS to keep him up to date on new releases. Any suggestions welcome! Thanks!

 Some of you may be aware that TIKTOK changed something and now the highest quality downloadable is 720p. Any solution to this ?
 I downloaded a tiktok video in July. It was 17mb 1920x1080.
 Today (November) I downloaded the same tiktok video and its just 2.5mb 1280x720.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I understand from my research, to be able to use Cloudflare Tunnels for free, you have to use their SSL certificates and thus allowing them to see all traffic going through the tunnel, right?
 One reason I'm self-hosting some services for my friends is that they don't want their data in the hands of big companies. Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.
 Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The case I have for my NAS has 12 HDD bays so instead of using the 8 SATA capable LSI controller, I opted for the 9201-16i. It's a great card, but I'm looking to upgrade my machine and I'm wondering if there is a newer card out there that is taking advantage of a newer version of PCIe in order to require fewer lanes. Granted with 12x HDDs I'm probably not even using 4 PCIe lanes, it's proven to be very difficult to find a motherboard that will support x16 and x8 at the same time, you definitely can do x16 and x4 at the same time though.
 My end goal is to have a pretty beefy NAS that can use Intel quicksync for Plex transcodes, passthrough a GPU to a VM, have a 10Gb NIC, and can use at least 15 (probably 16) drives. I know it won't be cheap, but obviously I'm looking to do this as reasonably affordable as possible.

 How reliable are SSD external hard drives? Should I expect it to fail soon? Like an old conventional magnetic disk drive could? It's kept on a desk at room temperature, never moves and just collects a bit of dust that I periodically clean off. Is this a safe device to keep pictures, music, files, etc. on? Or should I begin making plans to replace it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Basically the title. Recently changed broadband providers and this new router does not allow port forwarding of any kind. 
 Being said, I'm looking for a VPN service to deploy while I don't install my own router. I have a few in mind like tailscale and cloudflare access, but would like your opinion or what your solution is.
 Some requirements:
 - No need for port forwarding
 - At least two different users
 - Must use pubkey authentication or MFA (hardware key support would be great)
 - Access to entire LAN (for example, if I connect to the VPN server, I need to be able to access my router)
 - Local DNS (when connected, the traffic would use a DNS server in my LAN)
 - Highly desirable to work with docker/k8s but not a deal-breaker
 ​
 In the past I had a wireguard container running rock-solid, but without port-forwarding I can't do this.
 What do you lot reckon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm building my own homelab, and for some reason I want to use OpenLDAP for centralized user management. I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.
 Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.
 Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a server I built up over the years that I've recently installed a GUI on instead of just SSHing in and find myself using it as my main PC now at my desk.
 Also, I've started cycling indoors using the game/app Zwift. I've tried running it on my old laptop but it's just too old and underpowered. So my only option without buying a new computer is use my server to run Zwift. I've tried running it via Lutris/WINE but you can't access bluetooth or ANT+ so it's not ideal and it crashes randomly for me.
 I figured the solution is to just run Windows as the base OS (for Zwift) but run all the actual server media stuff (arr's, qbit, plex, vaultwarden, caddy, etc.) in a Linux VM. All of my podman config and media are in a 6 drive BTRFS array separate from the OS.
 I'm just not sure if this is a terrible idea or not, and if I did this, can I leave my BTRFS file system untouched and just mount it to the VM after I set it up?

 Server Specs: i7-4790, 250GB sandisk SSD for OS, 25 TB BTRFS array, 8GB RAM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I decided to build a rack in my home to simplify my studio setup by first isolating all the hardware noise in a soundproof small room. I'm also taking the opportunity to replace my current "not really a server" which is a slow Mac Mini with a 24tb raid 10 thunderbolt bay with Soft Raid.
 What I do with my server:
  
Plex Media Server with 5x simultaneous streams
 Home Assistant (Z-Wave, ZigBee & security cameras)
 Download torrents
  
I'm on a budget and I'm currently looking at the Synology 8 Bay RackStation RS1221+ (Diskless) sold at 1900$ CAD and 8x Seagate 16TB HDD Exos X16 drives in SHR-2 for a total of 96tb. With taxes and everything I'm at 4600$ CAD. It seems to be the cheapest server out there. I would have liked to be able to transcode but I haven't found any server that can do this in these price ranges.
 Am I missing something somewhere, do you have any recommendations? Keep in mind that I'm in Canada and everything cost more here. Thank you!

 Do you expect to have to upgrade in a year, 5 years, or more?
 Edit: Thanks everyone for their take! Just so you guys know where I'm at, I'm running a T620 for the past ~3 years that I bought used. I'm planning on using it for a few more years, but I wasn't sure when I needed to think more seriously about upgrades. For my gaming pc it's pretty easy for me GPU-wise. I always buy used when everyone else is dumping their old hardware and try to stay only 2-3 generations behind the latest.

 Anyway, my son has heard me talk about back in the day we would all get together for LAN parties and now he wants to host one. I told him Id help him setup in our basement (secretly excited myself for it lol). 
 I started thinking about the possibility of infection from these PCs. Im not over the top secure in my home network but I like to be at least aware. Everything is locked down to the latest standards of the hardware/firmware, guest wifi access is given for those who do not live here, etc.
 How do I secure these devices from the rest of my network while still giving them internet access?
 My thought was to use an old router I have, configure that on my network and allow them to hardwire into it. That should allow them to see each other, but nothing else, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.
 Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.
 My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):
 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US
 I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.
 Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?

The reason is that I have a mini heart attack every time I update, wondering if the update will break things. It hasn't happened yet on Linux (definitely has happened on Windows) and I always back things up before updating, but it's more about the unnecessary stress. 
 If I'm happy with an app the way it is, is it okay to not update it? I'm a beginner and use only a handful of things like Docker, Bookstack, Jellyfin, Tracks, Portainer, and some miscellaneous stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm upgrading from Edgerouter X, unmanaged switch, single unifi AP to a completely new system in a bigger place. I'm weighing my options, thinking of pfsense router/firewall, mikrotik managed switch, 2 or 3 Mikrotik APs. I intend to have 2 VLANS for general use and IoT separation.
 My main reason for leaving unifi is that I don't like needing dedicated hardware for their controller software (used to host the old controller on my PC) and they don't make non UISP routers anymore (I'm moving to a rack mounted space anyway).
 If I go with my proposed new setup above, how do I manage my Mikrotik APs if I'm using pfsense as my router? Is it as simple as running the managed switch in RouterOS mode rather than SwitchOS mode? 
 I can't find a tutorial for this exact situation to test before spending hundreds on equipment.

 I checked the serial at Seagate and it has a valid warranty until 12/21/2027. So according to Seagate, it has 5 years and month. He offers 2 years.
 My question is, would Seagate respect the warranty if I go to them with an invoice from a small computer store that doesn't sell to business?
 Is there a way these could be refurbished? Could I tell somehow??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a desperate attempt to move away from Adobe's photography subscription (I mainly used Lightroom Classic to organize my family photos on a NAS), I recently – and with the help of this sub – stumbled across Photoprism. I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. 
 But there are a few basic things missing, like:
 - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata
 - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like "turn image 90 degrees")
 - simple file and folder operations like "copy" or "move"
 Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! 
 But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. 
 PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.

 But I got a question here: Should I have to install SSL certificate on these services given I only use Wireguard to connect them in VLAN (not use public IP/port)?
 Basically, Wireguard can secure the stream in the tunnel, and my understand is there is no need to do another encryption. Is the idea right?

 something i'm exploring is using the PiKVM into a splitter, into 2x TESmart 16-port HDMI KVMs (to support expansion). is this viable? i haven't ever used a KVM before, so i'd appreciate any "gotchas" that i should be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to do a brain dump and have you all tell me what i am forgetting or if its a bad idea. I wanted to create a plex server and setup some authentication in the house for mgmt. So that got me thinking to do the following instead of getting a separate box to run as a server i would just extend my current pc and convert it to an all in one machine. 
 1) Base OS - Win HyperV via Server 2022 or OpenSuse and KVM/QEMU (use onboard igpu/apu)
 2) VM1 - Authentication Server and DNS and any other services that i need in the future
 3) Plex Server - GPU passthrough (cheap card for encoding), lots of storage
 4) Game Server - Windows 11 running Steam for steam link game streaming and native games ? (gaming gpu like a 6800/6900/3080 etc... )
 The thought process was i would use my laptop for work and stream games to the laptop and living room when i wanted to game. 
 I wanted to also maybe spin up a daily driver OS so #5) OpenSuse for normal browsing, documents, bill pay etc... 
 So questions
 1) What do you think?
 2) What am i forgetting to think about?
 3) Any reason not to use the base OS that runs hyper visor to also be the game server removing the need for #4? Steam updates never ask for a pc reboot so it would just be OS updates which the base os would have anyway. 
 4) Any reason to build a completely separate server and leave my pc as a dedicated gaming/work pc.

 I am not certain how to proceed now. Are there any further steps that I could take to verify the drive without SMART working? Would it be okay to leave things as they are, and zpool clear the device, since scrub fixed the errors? Or should I request for RMA on the drive?

 Seems like a decent deal for a set of 5, especially if you run them in RAID.
 Usually you can reformat 520 or 528 byte drives to 512 byte using sg_format, but there are some weird cases where you can't. Just wondered if anyone's tried these before I "take the risk" myself.
 There's a lot of them up for sale. It's not the best deal in terms of $/TB for SSD, but it's not too bad either, and if you're looking for high IOPS or redundancy for a smaller dataset it's not bad. I'm interested in maybe using these for a ~500GB array that I want in raidz2. The array will experience high random I/O so SSDs are basically a must.

 System BIOS: 1.6.0 IDRAC setting ver: 1.30.30.27 Message under IDRAC settings: -SWC0700: DRAC is not ready. The configuration values cannot be accessed.
 My first thought was to update bios and IDRAC firmware, which all attempts to do so have been unsuccessful. 
 Questions: Some “idrac initialization error” YouTube videos brought me to this Reddit page. 
 From similar threads It sounds like a motherboard issue. How do I verify that? 
 I’ve also been trying to boot with usb to upgrade the firmware but it never sees any files on the target device. From what I understand I have to format the usb fat32 but besides that do I just use the .exe From dells products and drivers

 I decided to build my own self-hosted file storage after my bad experience with Nextcloud. While it is a great and powerful product, on my old laptop it was really really slow, especially scrolling through large directories was a struggle. 
 My goal is to give a better experience while keeping things efficient. You can easily run it on a slow machines (e.g. DigitalOcean basic droplet with 1vCPU & 1GB RAM) and still have a nice performance.
 Shelf is currently at the MVP stage and doesn't do much, other than stores your file, but it already supports S3-compatible storages (S3, Minio, DO Spaces).
 Feel free to try the cloud version or you can try to run it locally, it should as easy as running docker compose up
 Please, let me know what you think about the project

 Even after activation, updates, virtio drivers installed, it's showing ridiculously high ram usage. Like, constantly showing 15/16 GB used, staying 85-95% at all times.
 It doesn't matter if it's only hosting a single RDC at the desktop sitting idle after a reboot, ram already jumping to 85-95%.
 I ran sfc /scannow, I ran dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, I cleaned out SoftwareDistribution and re-ran Windows Updates, and no change.
 In task manager, there's no processes using more than maybe 256mb, and adding them all up it's under 2gb used.
 Using ProcExp, I see svchost for Local Service and NetSvc as the big culprits, but I don't see anything in Task Manager using the ram. Screenshot from Taskmgr
 Anyone have any ideas what I should do?

 Or is there a calculation used for determining expected performance as I set up additional raids?

        <updated>2022-11-09T23:39:39.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've installed Pi-hole and Unbound on my container platform (Synology).
 Settings/Config:
 My routers IP is 192.168.0.1 and my Pi-Hole is 192.168.0.30 (Macvlan network).
 Here is the compose code:
  pihole: image: cbcrowe/pihole-unbound:latest environment: - ADMIN_EMAIL=xxxxxx@gmail.com - TZ=Europe/London - WEBPASSWORD=password - ServerIP=192.168.0.30 - PIHOLE_DNS_=127.0.0.1#5335 - DNSSEC=true networks: macvlan: ipv4_address: 192.168.0.30 volumes: - /volume1/docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d - /volume1/docker/pihole/config:/etc/pihole restart: unless-stopped 
 I can access the Web interface fine. In Settings > DNS, the following is set:
  
Custom Upstream DNS Server: 127.0.0.1#5335
 Respond only on interface eth0
 Never forward non-FQDN A and AAAA queries
 Never forward reverse lookups for private IP ranges
 Use DNSSEC 
 Use conditional forwarding: 
 Local network - 192.168.0.0/24 | IP add of router: 192.168.0.1 | Local domain name: LAN
 
  
Issue 1:
 So far, just for testing, I've manually assigned my laptop the IP address of my Pi-Hole server and for the majority of time, I've noticed internet access is fine however intermittently I will get a 404 on a page. I have 2 other devices next to me on the same network and they can access the site fine.
 Here is a Pi-hole screen shot of when the issue occurred when I tried to access the hub.Docker website at 16:34.
 This is annoying and will potentially be a deal-breaker if I can't even get my own device working properly.
 Issue 2:
 When I change my router settings so that DHCP clients receive the Pi-Hole IP for their DNS - my 404's and timeouts starts becoming more and more regular. My partner also says that Internet access becomes intermittent.
 Here is a Pi-Hole screen shot of some warnings that appear when I enable all devices on my LAN to use Pi-Hole.
 Hoping for some words of wisdom from you guys - any help is much appreciated.

 I do no really care for the physical phone, the hardware etc. All that’s important to me is everything inside the phone, even up to the search history lol. So that I can simple just place the backup into any iPhone if need may be.
 Ive made a backup of the phone on my macbook, but idk is that it? What else can I do to make it more secure/safe.
 (I have all their passwords/passcodes so that isnt a problem)

 I see it hovers at 86% CPU Usage and TP-Link wasn’t sure what “normal” is, however, I can saturate a link and the usage doesn’t change. 
 After all of the stability issues I’ve had with my CRS826-24S+2Q+RM with SwOS I’m hoping the TP-Link just switches packets around. So far so good though and setup was a breeze including VLAN’s. 
 I’ll give it a bit and then sell the Mikrotik.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.

 I'm a web backend developer trying to setup a web server for my remote development purposes.
 I need a node.js (nest.js to be specific) app to be running and it will be connected to postgres and redis docker containers in the same machine and i want to access my api from my router's static IP. I tried couple things but failed miserably. Since it falls into devops area, i dont want to dive deep into researching and experimenting. 
 At this point what steps I need to follow to be honest.
 Is there a guide or app preferably with gui serves to this purpose?

 Context: earlier today the Magic the Gathering trading card game website announced while moving to a new website design tomorrow they would be getting rid of many if not most old articles covering many aspects of the design and history of the game. I wanted to see if you could help show me/ recommend the best way to save these articles for personal viewing in bulk (as I would ask all of you to do it for me) and reading just in case the Internet archive doesn't have them all backed up?
 They only told us one day before the destruction. Thank you for any tips or help I kind of got overwhelmed searching the subreddit for tips or advice as I'm not especially technically savvy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am moving and would like to set up a temporary (3-6 mo) cloud vps without breaking the bank.
 I don't know much about how this would work, but I'm thinking oracle free tier + Nordvpn then torrent using the transmission vpn container directly onto a mounted hetzner storage box.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on that? -- or specific workflows I can follow up accomplish this?
 One thing I don't understand is how much file crawling these providers do. I'm guessing I should be encrypting and mounting the hetzner box, and i should somehow be encrypting the Oracle vm, but I'm not really sure if that's possible or what that really means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, my grandfather used to say "before you start a job, make sure you have all the tools/parts". I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.
 For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. 
 Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.
 I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 "trash can" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).
 So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. 
 A couple questions:
 What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?
 My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?
 I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).
 Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!
 Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.

 I am trying to find a tool which is related to image recongition but I feel this becomes too complex for what I need it to do.
 Basically, I have a bank of images along with a unique code for each image which should act as my main matching database.
 I then have another set of images which need to all be compared to this master list and if it finds an exact match or very close it will assign the unique code to it.
 Ideally, the output should be a simple CSV with image name in column A then the matched unique code in column B (if found).
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I am wanting to setup a few VMs as VPS's. Has anyone done this before? Did some searching, but nothing clear on exactly how to set it up. So basically, I have VM hosts in my DC and want to setup a website to log into, and click on the server and it will launch a RDP session in a sense. I also want to make this available for a few users that want to run "test labs". I know in Windows Server you can setup an RD Gateway and host a site to set a group of RDS servers for people to log into. Would that be the best way of doing it? I've set it up before, been a while, but can definitely do it again if that is the easiest way. But I would have to have RDS licensing for it. Was trying to avoid that part of it. But if I can't, then I will buy them. Just curious as to if anyone else has this kind of setup already? Thanks!

 Intended applications:
  
Samba/file sharing
 Database for interval data from various sensors (pretty much 24/7 writing and data being read for various reports and dashboards)
 Backups
 A couple game servers
 
 I see people saying that using consumer-grade SSDs for this is a bad idea and they will fail pretty quickly. Does anyone have experience with this? I like the idea of having SSD-grade performance and will also have a secondary backup system with a variety of mechanical drives I have saved. 
 What are the odds I regret my SSD choice 2 years from now?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to extract image files from a javascript-based book reader (it's a flipbook). The site requires a login to view the first 10 pages and a subscription to view the whole thing.
 I can download an html file using uBlock, which displays the book pages when opened in a browser, but I don't know how to extract the image from the js.download files.
 Screenshotting and stitching the files together isn't really feasible because I prefer a zoomed-in version. Can anyone help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with my use case.
  
home server
 docker with a bunch of containers running I need to access, some have no login you just got o the servers local IP and port to open them
 also use SMB very frequently
  
Current solution
  
all services only accessible via local network
 use openvpn tunnel to access said network and services
 to remain somewhat secure using random wifi AP's and mobile data I tunnel 100% of my traffic rather than just using the openvpn tunnel to access the local network
  
My problem is I am remote all the time and would much prefer to be tunneling all my traffic through mullvad vpn. Using openvpn to my home network means that traffic is exposed to my home internet ISP. SO in this case I understand I could use a reverse proxy to solve it. Say using my phone > mullvad vpn > nginx (for example) > one of my docker containers. This would give applications a secure way to login without directly exposing them to the internet, right? Would it be possible to host this reverse proxy on the same server that hosts my services? Is this advisable or am I better off with a premade solution from say cloudflare? I do have access to one of those free oracle cloud instances but I think the download bandwidth is capped pretty low on them, while upload is not, so it would probably run out of data acting as a tunnel for all of my data, streaming 4k movies or whatever. Will I still be able to use SMB with something like this?

 I recently came across an article that showcased different setups for exposing your homelab to the internet. I am fairly new to working with this type of setup, so any help is much appreciated!
 I looked into two setups that I could possibly set up and wondered how difficult, or what the difference would be between the two.
 https://theorangeone.net/posts/exposing-your-homelab/#vpn-only - I assume is a VPN tunnel? Not sure what this is, could someone explain? How would I go about setting this up if I have a VPS?
 The other is the VPN Gateway: https://theorangeone.net/posts/exposing-your-homelab/#vpn-gateway

Gives my wife an easy way to request stuff she wants without having to log into sonarr. Recently I’ve noticed more and more bad episodes being downloaded so I need to go in delete/redownload. I’m wondering if any one knows of a discord bot/service which will automatic delete and trigger a redownload on sonarr side. Just a tool that would make this situation a bit easier without having to involve me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I see a lot of people talking about dedicated router machines and I'm not understanding what it would be used for. I have let's say 6 PCs, 3 NAS devices, a few switches and cameras. ISP supplied modem going into a Netgear router. Static IPS are set on all devices, and transfer speeds between them are pretty good. My understanding is that a routers firewall is pretty good out of the box. So why would I want to make a router or even need a dedicated firewall box?

However there are times where there will only be one user. I would like both stations with their peripherals with monitors correspondingly, and for a single user to be able to use both stations and multiple monitors. 
 I see most kvms are only focused on limiting to one set of peripherals and one user. Is there a solution that can flex both active users and monitors ? 
 TLDR: Need a switch for 2 active peripherals x 2computers x 3 displays 
 1 user can control both laptops and all monitors, or 2 users can use their corresponding monitor and one of those two can duplicate their display

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming none of us have hardened facilities/homes/shops to store computers in, Most servers are one home burglary away from being stolen. In linux, how would you implement remote offsite backups?
 You cant just encrypt the offsite server's drive because they would require to be decrypted every time the server is rebooted.
 Please correct me if im wrong, but I think the way to do it is to temporarily encrypt my important data on my local nas to an empty SSD, where I would then rsync it to my remote server.
 remote server can stay wide open and so long as my host OS drive is ecrypted, my sata hdd's can remain in the clear because all they would hold is encrypted files that only I have the key for.
 How do you guys do it?

 Also, ELI5, what is the meaning of the numbers that come behind the card type, e.g. LSI 6Gbps SAS HBA 9220-8i, or LSI 9300-4i4e (just for example)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).
 Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.
 Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5" bays and is less than 19" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.
 ​
 Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?
 This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082
 This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/
 This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179

 So I just want to host a calendar that will show different status and a schedule below. 
 Calendar view that lights up with things like green if day off, red if job 1, yellow if job 2, blue if both jobs that day. 
 And then below the calendar it will show hourly time slots to show which hours of the day I'm not working. 
 Anything like this exist? I doubt it but doesn't hurt to ask.

 Anyway, I want to build a new home server. My current is an old gaming PC; AsusMobo, AMDfx, 16GB.DDR3, and GTX 780 running on Proxmox as a single server. 
 I'm thinking I can use Pi4s instead of getting new mobo, AM4 and DDR4. I'm new to cluster/stack so my original idea is that I setup a kube environment and run VMs on top, but I don't think that would work. (If I only run server images using docker engine without the need of GUI maybe) So my revised plan is installing Proxmox to each Pi4 node creating a Proxmox cluster.
 My only reason for this is thst I can chuck as many PI4s inside a full ATX case minimizing heat and power consumption. I live in a shared appt so my current is acutally inside my room.
 Have anyone done this before?

 I have OMV running on a Dell R710, customized to my use, where I have Snapraid and UnionFS running as my raid within OMV. I have this setup over 6 drives for parity but all 6 drive bays are full. I want to swap one of my data drives, as well as the parity, with 2 new 12TB drives which gives me parity for my (now) largest drive of 12TB as well as some more usable data as my existing drives are all 4TB.
 What's the absolutely most safe and simple way to do this? I have Rsync running with google workspace for cloud storage which can also be used as a transfer spot if needed, but I'm thinking there has to be a more simple way than I'm seeing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What/why I'm considering primocache
 So I bring this up because I don't have much use for the two sata SSD's. In fact it's very rare nowadays for me to even open them. Comparatively I do frequently access, use, and file-transfer from/to the 3TB drive. But it takes a long time to open a lot of files, and transfer. 
 The overall "reason" is split between wanting faster file transfers, less delay for opening programs or folders on HDD, and gaming / software benefits (if any) 
 I currently have the following:
  
C drive = 1 TB NVME SSD
 D drive = 256 GB Sata SSD
 F drive = 126 GB Sata SSD
 E drive = 3 TB HDD
 H drive = 1 TB Portable HDD (.... Potentially unstable)
  
RAM: 32GB DDR4 
 My understanding is primocache in two different ways:

I am hosting some shows on a jellyfin server,and some of the files are exceedingly large. For example, an episode of The Mandalorian (almost an hour, 1080p) is the same size as an episode of Evangelion (less than 20 minutes, 720p). They both are in mkv format, and around a gig or more. Where is all this extra needed storage coming from, and is there a way to shrink it without compromising any quality?
 Also, is there a good program that can pick apart files like this? being able to see all soft coded subtitles would be nice. 
 Thank you!

 I have a lot of hobby projects (Not very sensitive data) that I work on. I keep them backed up and synced to a cloud, so I can 1) revert files back to earlier versions, and 2) if my house burns down I can still retrieve my files. 
 My free OneDrive just filled up, so I am looking for a paid cloud storage now, where I can continue to keep my projects backed up.
 I would like to avoid a learning curve, and I would like everything to be as automated/easy as possible. I also don't want to be spending too much money, as I will probably just keep my subscription for the next 20+ years.
 Can anyone help?

 We purchased a new NetApp FAS 8300, and the engine part of it is too long to fit into our racks that we rent at our hosting provider. (flexential)
 At my office, we have another identical FAS 8300 and yes, it's huge but our rack has a door that was slightly 'popped' out, which allowed it to close. My hosting provider is trying to charge me for a new oversized rack, but we cannot be their only customer with NetApp.
 Curious if anyone out there has encountered this and found a way around it. (yes, the doors must close and lock, it's part of our SLA)

 What does everyone use to make their own collections available from their own NAS to the internet so you can access your own material securely and easily to either stream or download what you want at will?

 It will likely be hand-me-down parts from my current PC inc: i5 10600, 16GB Ram, 5-8 HDDs, Maybe a GPU later down the line for a headless game streaming server.
 It will mainly be a NAS / Plex server, little bit of transcoding and the odd docker container here and there. Specs are overkill but I'd rather build a NAS / Home Server than buy a 4bay Synology for £500+ for easier expansion in the future.
 I'm just wondering if anybody has experience running a similar setup, and want kinda power draw you're pulling (idle or under load) and just how expensive is it to run something like that?
 Girlfriend won't be impressed if I hike up the power bill too much no matter how much she likes Plex!
 If it helps,. I'm paying 37p per kWh

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Noob here. I have been sorting through all these files from my past, and I thankfully have already been keeping a log of checksums for all of the files. Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.
 This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.
 I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow. TIA!

 I am a nut about pro wrestling and have an 8 TB drive that has many subfolders including one called Matches. This folder has just over 7,000 video files in folders like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.
 The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.
 So the procedure:
  
Create a new folder in your APP / Server, for example "Mobile Photos".
 Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload
 Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and "Configure".
 Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option "The original file will....".
 Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)
 Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.
 Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.
  
Problems:
  
For some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.
 I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a "Photo Folder", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.
  
So hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!

 The problem:
 Our family has someone who has the information for the doctor and someone has the password for the EZpass login and another person has the document for the latest power bill. We are looking for a system that can contain off of this.
 I am hoping to find a Self Hosted (hopefully FOSS) application that we can use as a CRM for our family. We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).
 My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.
 What I have looked at and dismissed:
  
Homechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.
 Monica - This is for tracking personal connections. While cool, not exactly what I am looking for.
 'Real' CRMs - hubu, itflowly, salesforce, etc. These are just way to over the top and expensive

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am thinking about building a very simple Pi NAS. Like, one 1 or 2TB external SSD hooked into my home network via ethernet. I am a total noob at this stuff. For redundancy maybe pay google $2 a month for cloud storage or something.
 Right now this is honestly more of a solution in search of a problem; I just like to tinker mainly. Thinking it'll just be a place to stick important files without too much trouble. Here is what I would like to be able to do:
 ​
  
Stick family photos and videos on, from any source (Windows, macOS, iOS)
 Stick important docs on (old tax turbo tax PDFs, etc)
 Maybe stick some music files on
  
Importantly, be able to VIEW and edit the files if needed. Specifically I am thinking about our pics, which are incredibly disorganized, duplicated, etc. Would like to be able to open up the iPad and go through the NAS and be like "that one sucks, DELETE... that one is upside down, FIX.... Create a "wedding pictures" folder and move all these pics over there.... etc*"
 Is all that possible?
 \One thing that I am not clear on... let's say I go to a folder full of pics on the NAS and start editing them on an iPAD (or whatever device, PC, MAC, etc). Am I using whatever photo viewing / editing SW to view and edit the file residing on the NAS (i.e. the SW is acting like a "window" to look at the file still residing on another computer).... or am I pulling the file ONTO the device, making changes, and then when I hit "save" it overwrites (uploads) the new file to the NAS?*
 I am not sure there is a fundamental difference in outcome but just wondering.

 For example, i started looking at this website called Revolt which is a much privacy focused alternative to Discord and apparently i can self host it, do i need like a second computer that always stays online to do this or is it like a proxy thing?
 I don't know, can you help me?

The downside is you need a google account and billing enabled in Google Cloud dashboard, but there are 1000 requests / month for free which is pretty usable IMO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a drive fail in my 6x4TB raidz1 pool today and wondering the best way to insure I save my data. There is no other backup of the data (I know, shame me) and the drives are old and some are smr so another failure during resilver is possible.
 Now the data is a mix of music, movies and photos. The photos account for around 1 TB, music a few hundred gigs and movies about 13TB. The photos are most important as I can't replace those of I lose them but the music and movies could be replaced tho it would be a pain.
 My thought is to copy the photos to another pool while this one is still degraded and then resilver the pool. If i lose a drive while copying it wasn't going to survive the resilver anyways and I get some of my data, if the copy completes and then a drive dies in resilver I save my photos which is what I care most about.
 Any flaws with this plan? Is there a better way to go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is essentially the title and mostly comes from idle curiosity. Do they not make 2.5" CMR drives anymore? I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.
 The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.
 TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.
 Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...

 I don't personally like the fact that whenever I'm done with a movie / tv show / etc. I have to go to Radarr and Sonarr one by one, select the media, delete, tick the "remove files / folders too", confirm etc.
 It gets cumbersome for someone like me, who doesn't hoard data and gets rid of movies and shows once done with them, so I thought about writing a simple little administrative companion such as the mentioned.

 Are you all onboard with NPM or Traefik with Cloudflare (it seems to be all the hype)?
 NPM or Traefik with Let's Encrypt and not being proxied by Cloudflare?
 Do you prefer not opening anything up and just using a VPN from your laptop and phone to get to your services?
 I did the Cloudflare thing, and I have to admit it's amazed me how quick I was up and running, but at the same time, I'm not sure how I feel about proxying all my data through a 3rd party.

Their free tier allows for 100api calls so I think that would be enough for a single user that’s self hosting?

 - It needs to have 4+ disk slots that can each support 14 terabytes, but the more slots the better.
 - Needs to be fairly cheap (less than 200ish?)
 - It needs to be fairly quiet
 The cheaper the better. I want to use this over a nas because they are all really expensive, and all the reasonably priced ones can only support so much storage. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to set up an offsite backup system and place it at a friend's house. My current plan is to use Duplicati + Tailscale to connect the two. I'll push the backups over SSH or SFTP...something like that.
 My question now is what hardware to use on the receiving side? A few years ago, I would just have gone with a Raspberry Pi and call it a day, but given the shortages I wonder if there's something better now. The machine would do only one thing, and that's sit there, receive network traffic and write it to disk. So I imagine network / USB bus transfer speeds are important and CPU, RAM not so much but I'm not much of a hardware guy so I figure I'd ask here.
 I know Odroid has a bunch of different boards to look at. I'm also eyeballing an Orange Pi 3, but I really don't know what exactly I'd need as far as performance. Anyone have ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a lot of dashboards posted here over the last few months but i'm looking for one with a couple of things in particular...
  
2 links per item (internal and external)
 GUI based configuration
  
I know there are ways around the first item, but my setup is a little convoluted and having an internal and external link will help massively..
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m thinking of upgrading and updating my equipment that my family uses to stream media. We primarily use it for our kids but we are slowly building out our own library via EBay and dollar bins. 
 My thoughts were with the insane improvements to CPUs with the new generations that I should upgrade (first major upgrade ever). So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. 
 So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). 
 So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries. I ultimately end up with it all.

 There are a few hundred unhealthy videos among a few thousand videos
 How can I bulk-check them?
 Goal: Identify unhealthy movies. Write their filename and folder info into a text file. Then remove the files

I'd like to use a 4tb or 8tb External HDD for some old video project files that I just don't need quick immediate access to. I'd just like to put it on there, and then forget about it until I maybe need it for something. Each video project with all assets is about 10gb.
 ​
 Not necessarily looking in to like a NAS or second pc or something like that.
 ​
 If I go through with this, would leaving it plugged in or unplugged be okay?

 I added a public hostname pointing to my internal network at https://overseerr.mydomain.com, and pointed it to requests.mydomain.com.
 Whe I go to requests.mydomain.com I get a failed to find the page error.
 What am I missing here?

 And to do so, I thought of getting a NAS and install LibrePhotos or Photoprism (I'd need to see how they work to choose for one) or to directly use the NAS photo management system.
 The problem is, the documentation in both Photoprism and LibrePhotos ask as a requirement 3/4GB of RAM, which is not that common to have on a NAS (and if you find it it's paying a hefty sum). So my question is double:
 Users of these applications, what NAS are you using and how well does it work?
 If I get a 2GB RAM NAS, can I later upgrade it myself with RAM modules, or is it soldered and impossible to upgrade? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted a thread over on r/zfs, but I didn't really get any feedback, I've got a TreuNAS Mini XL+ arriving later this week and I'm debating plans to populate it.
 I've currently got 4x 8TB WD Reds in an ubuntu box with a raidz1 array, My original plan was to lift and shift the array into the new NAS, but I'm leaning more towards getting new drives and copying my data over, then I can migrate the drives and see if moving the pool would have worked.
 I can get 16TB IronWolf pros from my local MicroCenter for $280, and it looks like RaidZ expansion has yet to land, so I'm thinking I'd be best getting 4 drives up front and doing a raidz1. I guess I'm looking for a sanity check, if that's a good way forward for storing all my linux isos :D

I already have a VMware esxi server on a Dell r720 and a Plex server with 28TB on a old i5 6600K running all the ARRs as well (thinking of moving these to Docker, right now they're local installs). I had a 240gb and a 1TB SSD laying around. I installed Truenas on the 240gb. I noticed that I can't do anything with the excess space. So I wonder if is there a better way to run it. I hate wasting space I have several 1TB 2.5 SSDs laying around from various projects over the years I thought about buying a SATA card to run them off of too and use the 240 as a cache drive for the mechanicals. 
 What would be the best most efficient way to use TrueNAS? Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way? Bonus if you know a good place in the US to buy reliable used big storage HDD for cheap? I'd love to purchase some.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have a 4 tb NAS drive that I want to make an offline backup of. I have four 1TB drives and only one dock so only one drive can be attached to the system at a time. Is there an elegant way to start copying files to the 4tb drive to the first 1tb drive until it runs out of space, then wait till I swap it with an empty drive, and then keep copying, keeping track of all the drives needed to do this in order? I don't want the drives in RAID, because that would require plugging all of them in at once, and I also don't want one drive failing taking the data stored on all the other drives with it.
 Isn't this how tape drives work for storing huge drive arrays? It should be pretty standard archival practice right?
 Ideally, I don't want to have to fully reassemble the data to find something. I want to be able to plug in a drive, search around for what it contains out of the larger drive, and copy individual files back without doing a full restore. Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. 
 Is there a solution that can do all this? I use Linux if that makes a difference on works and what doesn't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I already have a Plex server with a 5 TB hard drive. But I am thinking of expanding up to 10 TB but I want some redundancy like perhaps having two 10 TB in maybe RAID 1 mirror mode. My idea is that have two hard drives one acting as a backup. Performance is not a concern since most movies don't go past 1080P and there are no more than 3 concurrent streams. I use a hp g800 mini which is serving quite well and I have had no complaints with streaming or content quality drops even in different countries. 
 Since performance isn't an issue my idea is I use Unix command line as the OS of the machine. The hard drives would be in NTFS format. I am wondering if there is any specific setup for this. Would I need some sort of NAS or a software solution that would be preferred without investing in additional hardware? Maybe someone has done something similar and could share a solution? 
 Much appreciated

CYA archiving. Through the years I've migrated through the "stack of floppies", "stack of 1/4" tapes", "stack of CDs" and "stack of DVDs". Is there anything that should stay current for the next decade? What (w/ proper storage) should last until it's time to migrate to the next "Latest & Greatest"? 
 It kinda seems that there is no longevity/cost-to-start/cost-to-maintain sweet-spot. M-Discs seem good longevity-wise, but they're expensive/TB and their individual capacity is a bit on the low side. Duplicate HDs are good on the cost/TB side, but how long would they last sitting in a firesafe once filled? LTO is great on the capacity and cost/TB, but start-up costs are very high and living through the floppy & 1/4" tape era, I'm leery about the longevity of tape in storage. 
 How reliable are refurbished LTO drives? They make the start-up costs more manageable, but how likely is a drive to clobber a tape and make it unreadable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a "problem" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.
 The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.
 One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on "disk1" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.
 To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.
 Some info about my system:
  
OS: Arch Linux
 Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1
 Asus Prime H510M-K
 Intel i3-10100
 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)
 Disks directly connected to the motherboard
  
I experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.
 I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.
 I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but I am just starting on my homelab journey. I want to be able to have a server with my data that I can access from anywhere (phone/plex, etc…) how do I go about this? 
 Can I put hard drives in an enclosed area in my server rack? Is there like a rack mountable hard drive holder with an ethernet port to access the drives on my internet? Or do I have to get a separate box (Synology) and have it just sitting on a rack stand? 
 Explain it like I am 5 or please point me in the right direction for a subreddit I can ask this question.
 Thank you so much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/DataHoarder
 Quite often have seen in comments that people suggest to move to HBA expansion cards for users who run bunch of HDDs, as this is more safe and provides more slots for those who run 8 or even more drives. By HBA, mean SAS HBA devices.
 My question would be - Why such devices are preferred in comparison to plugging many HDDs to SATA ports? 
 At the moment I have 6 drives connected, these already populate entire motherboard's available SATA ports. Also have an PCI Express SATA Controller Expansion Card (1 x PCIe X1 to 4 SATA), but currently there is no need in more slots. While on other hand probably I would like to expand drive pool later. Heard such cards are not recommended, because often cheaply built and can affect speeds as all drives will share single interface.

 My first thought was to stop the containers running on VPS A, copy them to VPS B and simultaneously start up both containers on both VPSes. That sounds like round robin DNS, which (I think?) is supposed to be a load balancing method.
 But that doesn't sound sustainable at all, especially when I think that if I wrote a post on VPS A's CMS instance I'd need to copy it over by hand to the other running CMS instance.
 So how would I correctly load balance one running app to multiple servers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, just a question about UPS and if I’m on the wrong path. I have about 12 power supplies connected to two power outlets. My problem is that my breaker always flips if for example the power for our apartment goes out for some seconds. If I try to flip it back, I need to hold it down for 1-3 seconds otherwise it flips directly again. The power consumption is low, for all power supplies and the server it is about 120 Watt.
 If I would connect a UPS (Eaton USV Ellipse ECO 800 USB DIN for example) to my small homelab server and the power supplies the breaker problem should be solved or will the breaker of the PSU then blow if the PSU goes offline (power outage longer than battery)? Help would be appreciated!

 Several of the applications / systems that I have (and no doubt others have) like to default to sending email for notifications. I'm fed up of email, much prefer using ntfy and all too often I set up a mail rule which hides a true positive because I've not thought the rule through :D
 I'm wondering if anyone has set up something like Mailu to effectively be an internal only email service which can then be monitored and alerted on another way?
 Or is there a better way to handle this?
 Ultimately I want to have a way for an application I self host, in my homelab network, to use SMTP to create whatever notification it wants on a service which is also inside my network. I have no desire to stand up a mail service which can email out to the wider internet. Then I want to use that to trigger alerting through whatever method (figure this out later... ?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for advice regarding HDD cache size. I'm planning on adding 2 drives to my linux server in a LVM Raid 0 configuration, it should match my existing raid5 in capacity (22tb usable). old raid 5 will become the backup volume, so no concern for data loss. LVM raid will allow me a on-the-fly conversion from raid 0 to 5 once I add a third disk. The server is used for many things, but 4k streaming via plex is the only real resource consuming thing (although we have only 1 stream at a time).
 WD Red Plus 12TB (256MB Cache) for €298,90 or €24,908/TB
 WD Red Plus 14TB (512MB Cache) for €373,98 or €26,713/TB
 Originally I had decided to get the WD Red Plus 12TB, but then I noticed that the 14TB has double the cache size. I'm not sure how strongly that would impact the performance and if it will be worth the extra 150€? Does anybody have any insights or opinions on that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone else have a concern that nginx-proxy-manager has been abandoned? The developer made it clear they were't going to work on version 2 anymore which i believe most users are utilizing. The reason that version 2 development stopped was to work on version 3. However it looks like there hasn't been commits in months.
 The version 3 status update looks quite concerning: https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager/discussions/1202. 
 If others have had the same concern I posed now, what did you choose to port to? I'm considering swag, but I have a cloudflare wildcard certificate being generated that I think may be an issue to port over to their framework.
 Side note, I'm grateful for the nginx-proxy-manager project and do not fault the developers or contributors if they don't have time to work on it or have other items they wish to focus on. This post is not intended to bash them. That project helped me dramatically in my self hosted journey. I will always feel appreciative for that project.

I create an entity, i.e. "Toothpaste".
 I use my phone to scan my fav toothpaste's barcode, and it assigns scanned barcode to that entity.
 I repeat adding another N entities.
 later I open that app, hit 'restock' button or whatever. scan N different objects with corresponding entities already existing. and it increments stored counters for those entities.
 later I open that app, hit 'withdraw' button or whatever. scan N different objects with corresponding entities already existing. and it decrements stored counters for those entities.
  
I don't really need any integrations. Only one I'd appreciate is sending notifications when certain items hit some count threshold. I also thought about purchasing a barcode scanner, but really thought that phone can do the same (even if slower) and it should be easier to implement. many thanks for any help.
 all other solutions I found require you to print codes, but I really want to use existing ones.

There's some concern for his wellbeing in the 3d community here on Reddit as his last couple of videos have had some statements in them that have a few people speculating.
 For those who aren't in the 3D world, his tutorials were some of the best, most specific and most useful tutorials out there for beginners and professionals alike converting everything from basics to very in depth modelling across various pieces if software .
 Has anyone got an archive? Was anyone backing up? If would be a huge blow to the 3D community to lose this knowledge. He was essentially used like a reference guide for generalists and 3D modellers and basically anyone as a hobbyist it a professional will either know the username if have unknowingly followed one of his tutorials. It's a big BIG loss if this content is gone forever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been exploring several options to accomplish this but I'm struggling to find info on some specific things, and which solution would work best in my case.
 Instead of rambling about every little thing I've googled recently, Im just going to list what I'd hope to secure.
 I hoping to have SSO for as much as possible, 2FA for everything, and I'd prefer to continue using NGINX Proxy Manager.
  
Synology NAS. I heavily utilize many of the Synology packages, and I'd like to have SSO and 2FA. I'm fairly confident this should be relatively easy. But I have found very little info on how it will interact with the iOS apps, and the desktop clients for some of the apps. Since they are designed to use the auth built in to the Synology, how will they work with an external SSO server? I have read it can be done, but I can find no info on how it actually works and what it looks like on the users end. 
 WebDAV, SMTP & IMAP. I have found so much conflicting information on these. Apparently many people just bypass them, but I'd rather not. I have seen mention of a way to enable 2FA for apps that dont support it by adding the TOTP code to the end of the password when logging in. But is that even the correct or best way? any gotchas? 
  
There is more that I would hope to secure, but I've been able to find decent info on the rest. 
 It's looking like Authelia is the app of choice right now, but I've also been looking at Keycloak, and Authentik. I'm Open to any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.
 With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.
 What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).
 Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.
 Thanks All!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/selfhosted! I'm a co-founder of Metlo (https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo). Excited to share what we’ve been working on for the last couple months. Metlo is a self hosted, open source API security platform that inventories, tests and protects your API endpoints.
 - We inventory your endpoints by scanning API traffic and detecting all your endpoints along with the sensitive data they contain
 - We generate information your security team may find useful like Open API Specs and risk scores for each endpoint
 - After this we discover vulnerabilities like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data or missing HSTS headers
 - Finally Metlo detects any anomalous behavior on sensitive endpoints in real time so you can detect 0-day attacks as they're happening
 We have a sandbox for you to play around with here http://demo.metlo.com/. Also, Here's a demo video if you would like a quick walk through of the product :)
 https://www.loom.com/share/349c9e5f267741e9a0fcd2dfd1f9956f
 We’d really appreciate your feedback and ideas, and are happy to answer any questions!
 EDIT: We - me and my cofounder. We'll be monitoring this post for a while! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm no expert, but I do have knowledge on how to work around. Right now I'm stuck on how would I be able to solved this situation. If I'm not explaining myself very well, I apologize thanks in advanced.
 Here is the situation:
 I have a TrueNAS that I use for video editing workflow and other projects. I already have my main client PC connected 10GbE via peer-to-peer ( its been working perfectly fine for over 3 years). I also have a Macbook Pro connected via 10GbE.
 Now I'm in the middle of too many lights at night lighting up since is in my bedroom, honestly I can not handle this anymore. I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.
 My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.
 From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.
 I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:
 MikroTik
 QNAP
 I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been too busy with life the last decade to play with computers, but free time has re-entered my life, and I recently got a server to start learning things with. I discovered I have an extra internet connection while putting it in my closet, and then after getting proxmox setup, and trying to setup a dynamic dns service for the domain I bought, I realized my home router also had a private IP address.
 Both connections have the same public IP of *.*.254.228, and tracert shows 4 hops between the device I connect with, to a public IP that is very similar, one more within my ISP, then out into the internet.
 Between my device and the ISP are:
 1 10.32.9.1 (10.32.9.1)
 2 192.168.89.1 (192.168.89.1
 3 172.16.254.1 (172.16.254.1)
 4 *.*.com (*.*.166.225)
 So after a little digging I'm wondering if what I'm dreaming up is possible.
 Link aggregation on pfsense, with a split SSH tunnel on each connection, that connects to a VPS server with a static IP my domain will point at, that runs a proxy server that points subdomains to my services, and balances the load down each connection.
 I could do all these things on their own, and would put more effort into the details of link aggregation and reverse proxies as they are the only new things I'm working with, but I decided to throw a question out here before I spend hours digging around to find it's not possible to do all together like I'm thinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I do apologize if this is not the right subreddit, but since this is an issue I came across while organizing my NAS contents, I thought someone here may help, and I do believe after all, this is effectively about archival of files.
 I'm currently running a script in a directory structure containing various video files and encodes everything in an x265 MKV file. I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.
 The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...
 Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression? Seems pretty ridiculous, but I'm kind of curious about it.
 Clearly thought, an image cannot just stay inside an MKV container, it's too much of a pain.
 Sorry for the weird question and thanks in advance!

 I am in need to build a nas that i will be using for editing off and cloud work for others to access to remotely. I am thinking about using the Iron wolf pro 16-20tb. Running in RAID 6 or RAID Z2 not sure yet. Not sure as to what hardware would be a great option to run. Do i need m2 ssd for catche, will that speed up the workflow and media streaming and if so how much to make a difference, 1tb ? 2tb ? one or two m2 ssd ? I know there is plently of guys on here who are smarter than me when it comes these things and i would highly appricate a helping hand. Thinking about adding a Lsi Logic 9201-16i 16port 6gb/S too for more sata drives to be added and as well use the case Define R5 case as it seems perfect for a large NAS build.

I wanted the portainer website (port 9000) to only be accessible if I VPN to the wireguard docker app that's on the server (that is, accessible only by the server's IP address). Here are the rules:
 action,protocol,port,source

 Racknerd doesn't seem to have a firewall page on the webui. I don't have much experience with setting up a firewall on server (CentOS / Alma Linux 8). Could anyone point me to how to achieve these rules? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.
 Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.
 The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.
 Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).
 My question:
  
Just how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.
 
Are there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)
 
Any other potential issues?
 
 Thank you

 These days, I've been looking for some solutions with my data, only cloud oriented after a bad experience with a NAS. My idea now is to select a Cloud provider in order to have a +1 secure backup between all my PCs, but the main interest for me would be to finally get a nice file Synchronisation solution for all my files that I use between my PCs.
 I've ended up doing a Google Sheet based on many, many, many providers. I used all the feedback from here to make it, so thanks again <3
 Yeah... I didn't have anything else to do, and went for a basic setup, it's ugly
 In the end, only Syncthing isn't Cloud based. But no matter what, it's an useful tool that i'll keep as a bonus tool anyway haha.
 As you can see, Filen is really getting the lead for me. But as in the bad points, my biggest fear is the Life Time Scam.
 So I wanted to know if anybody used Filen and have a good experience with the Life Time thing ? What about OneDrive and Sync which are still perfect tools for my need ?
 Thanks a lot !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just showing off but I thought this might be useful to people who own several hundred GB of comics. I use it to repack high quality manga on my Kobo, it more than doubled the amount I can store at once.
 I know such repacking software already exists because people post on manga sites all the time, but I couldn't find any scripts online, much less ones that were easy to use. This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.
 Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.
 The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.
 This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a matrix server that has been running for some time. Created with docker compose:
 version: '3.3' services: app: image: matrixdotorg/synapse restart: always ports: - 8008:8008 volumes: - /var/docker_data/matrix:/data 
 With the proper nginx config it runs perfectly.
 Enter the matrix facebook bot. I am missing something and I don't know where to start. 
 Following the manual, I first added the bot compose to my existing compose, resulting to this:
 version: '3.3' services: app: image: matrixdotorg/synapse restart: always ports: - 8008:8008 volumes: - /var/docker_data/matrix:/data mautrix-facebook: container_name: mautrix-facebook image: dock.mau.dev/mautrix/facebook:latest restart: unless-stopped volumes: - ./mautrix-facebook:/data 
 I ran docker-compose up -d and the config was created. In the config I changed homeserver address to https://matrix.example.com, homeserver domain to matrix.example.com, database address to /data/homeserver.db and appservice address to https://mautrix-facebook:29319. This last part is the one I am most doubtful about, and I have found very little info on it online. 
 Then, I reran the container and the registration file was generated. I copied it to /var/docker_data/matrix and edited my homeserver.yaml with the following:
 app_service_config_files: - /data/registration.yaml 
 Then, I restarted the container and the facebookbot user was not created. I know that because it didn't show up in the users' list at synapse admin. 
 I do not know what I am doing wrong and I would appreciate some help.

All of a sudden, starting two days ago, I wasn’t able to connect to my Wireguard VPN container on my server, and even when I made a handshake, no website would load on the client machine. My home assistant container has not been responding in HomeKit anymore either. The uptime kuma logs, both from uptime kuma and from my telegram bot are included in the links below. It’s also worth mentioning that my docker containers are not restarting, as they show to be running even when uptime kuma says they are down. Does anyone know why this might be happening?
 So far, I have tried restarting my router (I use FiOS) and rebooting the server, but neither has fixed the problem.
 Something else to add is that the telegram bot never shows the down notifications, it only shows the up notifications.

 I've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure - hence this post here.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar - I'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi :)
 I'm starting freelancing as an engineer, and I work for a few clients wich gave me an internal addresse on their servers. As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.
 I could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.
 I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...
 Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...
 I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:
 - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?
 - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.
 I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.
 Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?
 ​
 Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)

I have a DMZ network setup but I was wondering what is more secure for the boxes on this network. Proxmox is the hypervisor and the machines in question a two ubuntu VMs - but is it better practice to use the default virtualised nic assigned to the vms at creation, a linux bridge setup on proxmox of a dedicated or passing through the nic entirely to the VMS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm hoping to get some help and advice.
 I'm part of a community on Twitter who are anxious about the change in ownership and are looking elsewhere to continue. We're about 500-1000 members at the moment. I've warned them that if we move we'll have to pay for a server, but the majority are willing to chip in $1 a month.
 I have been looking into Mastodon, Misskey and Pleroma as alternatives, but I am unsure which one to go for.
 For those who know these pieces of software, I'm wondering about the following:
 1: How easy to install and maintain? I have basic experience of Docker, but not much more.
 2: I would be running this in a VPS, what would be the system requirements for these running 500 users and at running 1000 users? What sort of monthly costs should I expect?
 Not really self-hosting questions, but if anyone has answers:
 3: These are people who have only used Twitter, which is the simplist to migrate to in terms of UI?
 4: Many of their friends have already left for Mastodon. I read that Misskey and Pleroma can still connect and read Mastodon, but how does this work? Surely some features won't work? Would I be safer in just choosing Mastodon?
 5: Planning to raise funds for server upkeep via liberapay, good or bad idea?
 Thanks for any assistance you can give, I really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was slowly archiving things in a couple niche areas, about 25tb so far. The shut down of the library made me realize I need to step it up. I miss the old demonoid still, used to collect 1000s of old books there, irreplaceable now, and I'll never get the rest I think sadly. So many other trackers are just gone. I'm building a large offline archive of useful stuff for the niche I exist in. I have access to decent bandwidth now but I'll be fully off grid within a year or so. Collecting From Wikipedia to full copies of a couple trackers to some site copies via wget. That take down made me realize I need too get at it. I'm thinking either 4 bay nas or a small 8 bay server. I liked the serverparts price on 18tb, but the pricing at best buy is not great. I'll likely use the drives as main drives for 2-3 years then upgrade and turn them to offline backups and scrap/sell my 1/2tbs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. 
 I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault
 It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.
 So my best thought is that ideally "everyone" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.
 Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the "library of alexandria" idea.
 Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.
 Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group! Excited to learn more of how people are backing up their life.

 I had the same issue around 8 months ago. The first time it happened was when I attempted to recover data from an another encrypted drive (with uncorectable errors and reallocation events) did this happen. Of course, I gave up on that since I knew then the data was corrupted.
 I found the missing files from 8 months ago. The files and folders which have disappeared I don't care about. I'm just worried about the existing data on the drive.

 As you can see, everything appears to be healthy on drive E.

 Normally, chkdisk could, could solve the issue. But not in my case, right? Since the file system is encrypted. What do I do? Do I delete the files? What about the missing folder? How do I delete the missing folder?
 I have backups. Do I restore from that?

 I currently run a Synology NAS for data backup, with some services mainly on Docker. Nothing is exposed to the Internet, everything runs behind a VPN.
 Now I would like to tinker with some services that need to be joined over the Internet (ie: some test websites, Wallabag, reverse proxy with Authelia...), probably in Docker as well.
 I wouldn't like to run them directly on my NAS because:
  
I care about my personal data,
 From my experience, there are too many security flaws in Docker images we didn't think about before exposing them to the world,
 Docker on Synology is so outdated anyway that I don't trust it.

 From my readings, the next step for me was buying a NUC/Tinyminimicro/whatever and setting some containers reading data from a dedicated NFS folder on my NAS.
 But I'll just run a few services, the machine would idle most of the time and add 10-15W to my electricity bill.
 ​
 So now I'm thinking about running publicly exposed services in a VM running on my NAS:
  
This one has enough RAM & CPU to handle a few services in a VM so it's more power-efficient,
 Public services would run with or without Docker, but on the VM,
 Important data would be accessed via NFS (even if it's the same physical machine) on a specific folder, so it would be easier to backup,
 If a service is attacked, the data would be backed up (replication, distant backup, and so on). At worst, my VM is killed but it's no big deal.
  
​
 If I resume my idea, I want to add a layer (the VM) for better isolation between my public services and my NAS.
 Do you think it's secure enough for most attacks, or I shouldn't trust the VM isolation and buy a different physical machine?
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

 Am I missing something obvious here? Is there a toggle buried in settings somewhere? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a proxmox host running for almost two years now. I have setup almost everything by hand. Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.
 I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.
 I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?
 In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk). This makes backing up data easier to manage, also some disks/volumes/containers I want to encrypt.
 Can someone point me in the right direction?

Kleopetra does this (gnupgp) but for some reason, it fails for files above 2 Gigabytes. Simply creating checksum files is useless if I cannot use them to verify data.
 Edit: Found a solution Thanks to u/xlltt
 https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab is exactly what I was looking for. Although I haven't tested larger files (512GB+) with it, it works nicely with my current setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I just got my first piece of homelab hardware yesterday and installed ProxMox into it without major issue. After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.
 I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?
 Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)

 Currently my hyper visor is proxmox on proxmox I have a vm for truenas which has my pools and samba shares. I also run jellyfin from my truenas using truecharts (and a few other apps). Anyway, I’d like to mount my team drive too so I can access from jellyfin and other apps (since I can access google at work but not my home network on my work pc). Anyway, how would I do this? Maybe even mounting it from proxmox into truenas? Idk I’ve been trying to figure out a way now for a few days. Any help is appreciated please

 I run a few internal services in my homelab (Grafana, HomeBridge etc) and it is a bit annoying that when I surf to them I get the "Not Secure" warning since I do not have an SSL certificate for them. It also means my password manager asks an extra question before it fills in username and password.
 I would love to fix this without having to obtain an SSL certificate. Does anyone have any solutions for this?
 Thanks!

Configuration took ~10-15 min and the UI/UX is top notch. It feels like you just click a few buttons and save hours of configuration time. I'm experimenting with the ability to give family members secure remote access to Overseerr and this solution seems perfect. If anyone needs help with their configuration feel free to msg me on here or on discord (dampkring#2575).

I'm just Looking to possibly migrate my unraid over to it but not sure what hardware I might need to make it happen. I have something like 80 TB running a chia coin farm, media server, and a few other services. I see from some googling that Dell says max drive sizes are 1 or 2 TBs using the onboard 6i SAS RAID Controller installed. Is there something I can buy that would let me hook up 10-20 sata hard drives that isn't raid? I think the biggest ones I have are 16 TB. Thanks r/homelab! You guys are next level =)

 I have some files in my Plex that have multiple audios and subtitles language. I'm one of those that prefer to watch anything in their original language and use subs instead of dubs, and I was getting bothered on how for every episode I had to change the audio from English to Japanese for some anime (24 episodes, and each episode I had to change the language).
 This is what I found, this little beautiful project done by cglatot. You can bulk select by season, series...etc and select the default for audio and sub for it. It looks like it hasn't been updated for a while but it works perfectly fine. You can selfhost it or use the hosted version.
 I wanted to share it.

It doesn't have wireless and I don't see a reason to spend on the wireless components to put it somewhere around my house, so I figured maybe there would be a cool use case for it in my rack. So far, my homelab is pretty basic. Unraid server with the Arrs, plex, and supporting docker stuff for media. Cloudkey gen2 for my cams and access points. 24port ubiquiti poe switch. R210ii running pfsense and it's adguard. Pretty much sums it up.
 I'm wondering if there is some cool use case for this little guy short of selling it or making it a garage pc. Some sort of homelab use I'm overlooking despite not having a smart home for all that stuff.
 Thanks all, from a rookie.

All I could find about it is that it's a top level domain (TLD) but that didn't explain if it's fine the way it is or if some setting is off. I checked the DNS settings and added the cloudflare DNS servers for IPv4 and IPv6 but that didn't change anything either.
 I ran AGH a couple of months ago with the same settings and didn't have this issue. Not sure what's different this time.
 Any advice appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got a rack-mount chassis + motherboard with 12 3.5 hard drive slots. I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. 
 I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. 
 I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB. That being said, I can deal with smaller capacity for now and get one of those 60 drive behemoths a couple years later. I would rather get something decent to start though.

 I have a plethora of docker containers running things like NPM, Jellyfin, Adguard, Nextcloud, Uptimekuma, and a couple of Minecraft servers. My issue is accessing them from outside the network. I have a VPS acting as a gateway and using Iptables to forward all traffic through a Wireguard tunnel into the LXC the docker container I have NPM running in and this setup has been working for the better part of a year.

 Or what would be the best option for 150 drives Chia farming on its own and I could split off the rest of my 20 drives on their own. (No raid, as data can all be replaced with re-plotting).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I've been practicing hosting my own server in a VM until I buy the hardware to do it properly. I've been using Ubuntu Server (and Docker with Portainer) cause that's what mots sources I did my research from have been using plus I already use linux so I already knew my way around and also because linux is pretty easy to run on any hardware.
 I intend to self host pretty much anything I can, my own cloud for file storage that I can access from any of my devices, a media server, a music server, game servers, pihole, bitwarden and maybe a little file share for my friends so we can share large files over discord.
 I've heard that some people use Proxmox, FreeNAS or TrueNAS but is that because of their preference or are there any benefits besides convenience of not having to set up RAID and some other things manually and if I were to use them would I still be able to run all the other apps on top of it with docker?
 I'm sorry if this is a common or stupid question, I'm really having trouble finding the answer I'm looking for but I might just be searching for the wrong questions.

I bought them here in Brazil from 3 different sellers and they were all fake. There's a huge influx of fakes here, even HDDs are fake, they put a memory card on it with something to make it heavier, I'm traumatized at this point.
 So I plan to buy from a US shop, need help to pick one.
 The contenders are:
 SanDisk from Western Digital: https://www.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/sandisk-ultra-uhs-i-microsd#SDSQUAC-256G-GN6MA
 Microcenter: https://www.microcenter.com/product/657911/micro-center-premium-256gb-microsdxc-card-uhs-i-flash-memory-card-c10-u3-v30-a1-micro-sd-card-with-adapter
 and the cheapest
 Silicon Power from bhp: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1536564-REG/silicon_power_sp256gbstxbv1v20sp_256gb_elite_a1_uhs_1.html
 They also have SanDisk: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1593902-REG/sandisk_sdsqua4_256g_an6ma_ultra_256gb_120mbs.html
 Those shops seem to be the most legit I've found, any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I are getting ready to move into a 140 year old house (edit: it was stripped to the studs - all electrical, plumbing, and HVAC is circa 2021). At some point during the home’s existence, it was split into two apartments and we have a laundry closet downstairs and upstairs. I’ve gotten the okay to turn the downstairs closet into a server/electronics room. 
 I plan on putting a rack in there, along with my TV tuner for the house, and whatever equipment our new ISP provides us with. 
 The room is a pretty standard laundry closet - you could fit a stacked washer and dryer in there - has a 240V outlet and a 120V outlet. The water supply has been capped and cut off. And there is a vent that goes outside. 
 Does anybody have any sort of guidance for this setup? Can I use the vent for the routing of wires outside (or even for ventilation) - is there maybe an adapter or something for repurposing this vent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently given four of these 5.25" hot swap bays from my workplace. As I already have an old case, fan and PSU, I'd like to build a cheapo DAS setup.
 USB to SATA enclosures are all over the place, so I assumed it would be straightforward to find the standalone adapters or break-out board I'd need. Not so, it would seem!
 Cables like these are available and fine for 2.5" drives, but unsuitable for 3.5" drives as I'd be powering them separate from the data cable. On the other hand, cables like this require an external barrel plug for power, which I'd have to duplicate four times. Ideally, I'd like to manage power with my PSU using the paperclip method.
 Are there any USB-C to SATA3 adapter boards on the market? Aliexpress, Amazon and eBay are failing me.
 Probably the best option I found was this adapter, but it looks to be long out of manufacture.
 If not, what do you think is the best approach here?
 Thanks for the advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally releasing something to the wild that I think is actually legitimately useful: oci-registry, a lightweight implementation of the OCI Registry spec with filesystem and S3 storage back-ends.
 Features
  
Pull-through cache for any registry, not just docker.io
  
This includes private, authenticated registries. This means that you can create an unauthenticated mirror of a private registry and expose it to the Internet. Easily. Don't do that.
 
 Two storage back-ends
  
S3
 Local filesystem
 
 Small footprint; in my test system, the official registry uses approximately 130 MiB of memory to mirror docker.io; five replicas of oci-registry combined use approximately 60 MiB to mirror everything in example.yaml, plus one private registry. CPU is negligible for both.
 A helm chart
  
Why?
 A few weeks back, I had a need to setup local mirrors of $dayjob's private registry. I didn't have much luck making this work with the official registry, so I decided to make this. While I was at it, I decided to make it do everything I wanted in a registry mirror.
 Rather than copy the rest of the README into a Reddit post, I'll end it here for comments/questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So will be easier to explain with an example.
 I had 5TB, currently adding another 9TB.
 E.g
 Files will be split between multiple drives:
  
1TB NVME SSD
 2 TB Hard Drive CMR
 3 TB Hard Drive SMR
 8 TB Hard Drive SMR
  
Lets say I want to split my Folders, Files, Steam and Movie Library between all drives.
 And lets make it more complicated by saying certain files require either the SSD or CMR drive.
 The 2 SMR drives are for files that don't require constant access or fast read/write speeds. 
 I Don't want to merge drives into 1 mass storage array.
 I will organize everything with speed and read/write access mind.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Now, currently my solution is adding shortcuts to to every folder in every drive.
 But that is becoming extremely messy. Every folder has 6 shortcuts that link and link back to every file.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ​
 Is there a better way to organize and access everything?
 There has to be like eg Local Client software that is light weight and can select multiple drives as a source to display and organize multiple files.
 Kind of like Plex or Adobe Bridge except I want to link and organize files across multiple storage drives.
 ​
 What I basically want to do is:
 Organize and Link Folders/Files across Multiple Drives in a client/root directory or software that gives me fast access to files regardless of where they are stored.
 Files/Folders added across multiple drives are displayed together regardless of source and can be opened from 1 central location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been kicking around an idea of implementing an electronic key card system for 2FA on my home network and possibly access control via electronic door locks. Mostly I want to do this based on some things I've seen at work going wrong and I was hoping to prototype or at least get an idea how much it would take to home grow a usable system without blowing our budget. 
 I believe the access control system should be vlan-ed off from the regular network, but it would need to get updates from a domain controller when access is removed for an individual.
 The system needs to be independent of any cloud services and cannot rely on any internet based token generators due to the system needing to work in the event of communications failure.
 I'm thinking RFID or NFC based cards, because they are cheap to obtain and encode.
 Anyone have experience that can point me in a useful direction? 
 I'd like to stick to open source if possible because this is a side project semi-related to work and I don't have a lot of disposable income to throw at it. I just want to build the system and see what kind of dependencies are required to get an idea how much smoke is being blown by security vendors.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the JRE went to Spotify, I know there were at least one or two people who had his whole podcast history backed up. That made sense because it was something that existed prior to him moving to Spotify. What about since? 
 I've been interested in checking out Hideo Kojima's Brain Structures, but they have it completely locked down. Some other podcast had mentioned "pro tip, use Google Podcasts if you don't want to use Spotify" yet for the life of me I can't figure out how to do that. I've seen a ton of Spotify downloaders out there (r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH has a lot of info) but all of the ones I tried were either down or didn't work. 
 Have people actually been archiving Spotify exclusive podcasts? I see almost no requests for them anywhere, no matter where I look. Just genuinely suprised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. So, I have a bunch of hard drives laying around that are full of data. I got no space in my computer so, i'm just doing some research on keeping hard dives offline and what the recommendtaions are to ensure the data is protected over the long term.
 For safe storage of the drives the interwebs say:
  
Store the drives at room temp somewhere where it cant be dropped!
 Avoid storing the drives in any moisure or damp areas.
 Put them in anti-static durable cases.. Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.
  
But what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?
 From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? 
 If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? 
 And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk? (and prevent bitrot)
 Also, how frequently should we be doing this? ..every 3 months? ..every 6 months? ..every year? 
 How many of you guys are storing drives offline like this? And have you ever lost any data this way due to bad storage or data getting corrupted somehow.
 Thanks in advance.

 You can find the address by running a simple lspci command. Should be something like 01:00.0
 So the final command with the load of info I'm looking for would look like

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please bear with me, this an involved posting. I have searched all over and have not come up with even a partial solution that would be self-hosted.
 I live in a WISP environment (Wireless Internet Service Provider), which I have no control over the WiFi APs. My access to the outside world is through WiFi using a router in a wifi bridge mode; no Ethernet connections are available. The architecture of the WISP system, WPA2-Enterprise, allows other apartments to connect to the AP in my apartment which has several SSIDs. Every apartment has an AP in it and act similarly.
 What I am looking for is a Monitoring/Analytics solution which gathers continuous passive WiFi environment information over time such as WiFi slowdowns, WiFi outages, number of WiFi clients attached to an AP MAC address, signal levels, number of WiFi disconnects/reconnects, etc. This is similar to what could be obtained by using Kismet with a filter to gather real time statistics. I would also like to not run out of disk space over a week if at all possible.
 Does any solution for this problem exist? Or, alternatively, could something like this be cobbled together from existing self-hosted parts? Thanks for any help.

The storage directory has "nouser" and "nogroup", for owner and group. When I add directories to "storage" they are created with my local user and group. This is causing me a problem accessing them as a docker volume (I'm using the uid and gid of the local user). I can't even delete the directories created in "storage" as sudo. I can, however delete them from the "disk1" or "disk2". Can someone point in the right direction, please? Is there something special I need to do in the docker-compose file? Then end goal is to store media files and manage them with sonarr and radarr as containers, and docker permission denied error is a real road block.

 It's a while that I started the side project of building my home media and storage server, and I still have nothing working at hand, but I learned a lot and my opinion about what I want and what i need changed radically. Thus, I wanted to write down all my thoughts on my experience so far to gather opinions and suggestions.
 But first a bit of introduction. I am 25 years old, passionate about tech but not really expert about IT. Always used windows for school and gaming and recently became more conscious about owning my own data, it being by not using cloud storages, and paying for media I will not really own. On top of that, the recent world developments, geopolitically and in company strategies, made me more privacy conscious than before. PS: I have never used linux extensively …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Hoarders,
 ​
 i stand humble before you with the ask for help.
 ​
 I have two Hard drives (A, B) with Content that used to be identical but is as of now 70% the same. The rest is either only on A or on B.
 ​
 Both A and B have new added and removed data.
 I want to merge them to keep only one going forward.
 ​
 I tried to resolve the issue manually and with the help of https://freefilesync.org/
 but i get more mess than before
 ​
 i thought about my issue and think i could tackle it in a two step way:
 ​
  
​
  
first remove on Drive B every file that exists on Drive A at the same location and is identical
 wich leaves me with a delta of only Files Existing on Drive B that are either changed, added or removed from Drive A
 ​
 2)
 the second step would be to check which files that are left on Drive B do already exists on Drive A in any location and are identical (so i can catch files that were moved on Drive A to a new location) and delete them from Drive B
 Result:
 Which would leave me with just new and unique files on Drive B with a much smaller subset wich i could tackle manually and sort where need be
 ​
 does any of you have any Input or faced a similar problem? do you know of any tools that can do either step one or two. Much appreciated 
 I visualized what I want to achieve in this image:

 This question has been bothering me for a while and I thought this is the best place to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm looking for a backup solution which is selfhostable and can Docker my docker volumes. Looking for the following features: * Automatic volume backups on defined intervals * Incremental backups (It is a must because I don't want to reserve 30 GB for a 1 GB files if backup runs once daily). * Can support GUI interface too (not much required, but will be good to have) * Can automatically stop the docker containers for backup and then can start them automatically after backup as well. * Will be good if it can support email/telegram notifications. * Can support file exclusions too.
 I love Kopia, but sadly it's not easy and productive to backup docker volumes with that.
 Currently I'm using This but it doesn't support the incremental backup and that's the biggest issue for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I am thinking of putting together a small sff box (like the tinyminimicro size from lenovo dell and hp) for general VMs running on proxmox. 
 I have no need for ECC, nor am I going to put multiple drives in there or need GPU for gaming or decoding. As I will probably going to use it for something like k8s cluster for school and run some other tasks that use multiple cores once I finish that school project. (Or migrate VMs from other machines I have currently running)
 My budget is ~ 200-300 dollars and I can do barebone systems (I can supply my own RAM and SSD/HDD). But as I try to look on ebay and youtube for some ideas I just got lost in the amount of choices and suggestions and feel like my best bet is to ask people here in the community.
 Thank you ahead of time for any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The UPS I have is the EP-400-8HTR-1000. It takes 4x7.2Ah 12V batteries. It worked normally providing power. However, the unit would power off after a few seconds on battery power. So, I thought to replace the batteries. 
 When I pulled the old batteries out, they all tested ~13v. I put the new batteries in the same way the old ones were, all testing ~13v, and when fully wired shows 26v. 
 I plugged the batteries back into the UPS and plugged the UPS into power. Won't turn on. If I disconnect the batteries, it will power on. Connecting the batteries immediately powers the device off. 
 Looking for insight to if this is a possible fuse issue or something else? Battery Wiring MSPaint Special

Today we tried a few different ways with the Windows Server 2022 .iso and various programs like balenaEtcher. Rufus and the Dell Lifecycle Controller look promising and using a DVD seems like it might work also. This is beyond the scope of my knowledge and Im not sure where else to look but I want to have something to try for next week.
 Note: we are not allowed to use VMs but I did happen to have a flash drive with proxmox on me and the installation wizard came right up. Every other attempt we made with a bootable usb and the windows server .iso failed.

 Side Exhaust
 Door Closed
 ​
 In my old house I had a third-floor office with a desk that was rarely used so I converted a desk cabinet into a server cabinet with a 7U rack inside.
 Since then I’ve moved to a smaller place so this cabinet sits in my office where all my cat6 drops are.
 The cabinet is a BIT loud, but really not to disruptive but if I can reduce the sound even bit that would be a win.
 Option #1
 The main culprit for the sound is the NavePoint 1U fan I have under my Raspberry Pi 4’s.
 If I need absolute silence I shut the fan off but I won’t do it for more than an hour or so because the temperatures of the Pis start to get high when that happens.
 Is there a better 1U rack that will run much quieter?
 I also installed 2 exhaust fans at the top of the cabinet to help get fresh air inside the cabinet those fans run pretty quiet though.
 Option #2
 I could move 4 of the 6 Pi’s to my secondary rack in my basement. Would removing 1U and 4 Pi4’s reduce the heat enough that the rack fan would not be necessary?
 Of course, I could run the Pi’s in enclosures with fans and abandon the rack mounts but that’s not a clean look.
 Is there a better option I am missing?

 I also have White Dwarf 284-332 with a few random gaps, but PDFs of those are easy to find so I won't feel bad chucking them if I have to.
 Can arrange pickup/dropoff in London in the next few days (on or preferably before the 8th), or post to you (IDK how much to expect to pay, been out of the country a long time, if it's significant cost-wise I could probably go halves, if it's cheap I can cover it).
 Mostly in good condition, mostly lightly to moderately read, some more heavily read, some unread, some have been lightly folded but are stacked up now which will hopefully flatten them out.
 All I ask is that you send me PDFs/ISOs whenever you get around to scanning them, and upload them to the Internet Archive. No time window required (I know I'm basically looking for something for free, I just hate the thought of these being lost forever).
 Still got some boxes to go through so might find a few more.

My purpose is to have digital copies of these photos with comments to figure out when and where they were taken. Some were before I was born so I need help from others. 
 Is there any kind of program like this?
 What’s the best scanner to use for digitizing old photos?
 I’m not sure if this is the right place for this kind of post but, it’s a LOT of pictures. 
 Thank you, Dustin.

I know 550w is better for my need but my local MC and BestBuy only carry RM650x and up. I don't want to order online because I want to play with my new server in the weekend. At this level of load (<20% or even 10%) neither will run efficiently, does it really matter?
 How about RM750x? It's somehow cheaper than the RM650x right now.

 But one thing was made abundantly clear in that thread: don't use Cloudflare tunnels for non-html content!
 In this latest update, the Cloudflare Tunnel has been replaced with a VPS Tailscale tunnel here.
 The other feature released today enables all of the Jellyfin Client Apps to access your Jellyfin server. Previously, access was only possible from web browsers.
 The tl;dr is that client access is granted based on an IP whitelist that is implemented via Nginx dynamically checking if the IP address has a valid Authentik session. This is described in more detail here.
 Feel free to ask questions, critique, etc., and I'll do my best to answer.

I want a windows VM that runs 24/7 for some services that would only run on windows, was also thinking to move to a virtualized router with pfsence on a VM and a couple more VMs for jellyfish, true nas etc. So I was wondering if it's possible to use proxmox at the base, virtualize windows 10 and use it as a normal desktop environment? I've seen some YouTube videos but they always seem to connect to proxmox server from 2nd pc over browser. I would like to directly connect to my machine and be able to use my VMs as a native experience. Is it possible?

 The things I had issues with and had to teach myself about include:
  
Setting up HAProxy and Acme on Pfsense to forward appropriate subdomains to different vms
 Setting up NAT port forwarding on Pfsense
 Figuring out NGINX web server configuration
 Doing #3 only to find out that I had the address for my web server address set wrong in WordPress
 Figuring out how to get Multicraft to play nice with Minecraft Bedrock Edition
 Figured out how to work with Cloudflare’s DNS
  
Despite all the frustration with fighting some of these problems I am very happy to have learned a bunch of new things. There will likely be blog posts that come out of this.

 I have around 100GB of family photos/videos currently only backed up physically. I'm adding family members' backups to mine as well so the number will grow but probably won't get close to 1TB. 
 I'm not sure if paying for an upgrade on Google Drive storage is my best option. I like the 3rd party accessibility of Drive - if something happens to me it should be pretty easy for family members to recover their pictures from my cloud backup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend and I are looking to ramp up deals and restock articles on our tech/lifestyle blog, but we're lacking the tools to monitor real-time pricing and availability of a large assortment of products we've selected from multiple online retailers.
 Ideally, we'd like to see:
  
Item/SKU
 Price
 Retailer
 Commission rate (optional)
  
...Preferably with the ability to export that data to Excel.
 I've tried Restockify but it's extremely limited in functionality and the types of products you can track. We want to monitor everything from smartphones on Samsung.com to sneakers on StockX.
 He also mentioned a few bots that scalpers use, like StreetMerchant and NerdSpeak/NerdSeek; however, those tend to either break or also face the same retailer limitations as Restockify.
 To be clear, we're also not looking to scalp. We just want more comprehensive updates on product inventory at places like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, GameStop, etc. to tweet and write articles about them for everyday consumers as an extension of our product reviews arm. Pretty standard affiliate marketing content.
 As an example, Future plc (publisher behind TechRadar, Tom's Guide, PC Gamer, etc.) has a working proprietary version of exactly what we're looking for. I'm just wondering if there's an open-source application or paid service we could use that meets the same needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a tiny website that I host at home and I setup my DNS through the domain provide (google) to point at my external IP. 
 I've had some people who wanted me to share my website (which was used mostly for family related things and personal notes to myself); but I'm nervous about people figuring out the static IP at my house and trying to get in.
 What is the best way to 'hide' that IP?
 I figure the traffic would look something like this:
 random user goes to website -> domain.com points to external server at xxx ip -> xxx IP routes to my home IP which serves up the data
 That way if they ping/whois/etc, they see the 'xxx' IP address and not my external IP address. Are there any 'easy to use' services to accomplish this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, hopefully I have come to right place for an answer. Apparently my search skills are lacking, because I can't find anything I want when I type in "Backup my Android phone to my PC automatically from anywhere". And I've tried every configuration of said search.
 Background - IT management (for a school district, so not rich) who is getting near retirement and now has grandkids.
 So - what I'm looking for is two-fold.
  
I want something similar to my Drobo I used to have, without giving up too much of my hard earned money - close to retirement as I mentioned above. Something that can backup all of my PCs, servers, documents from the last 25 years, and maybe stream some movies and music. DAS or NAS, I'll figure it out either way depending on the price point.
 I want some software that will allow me to backup my children's pictures, as well as my pictures from anywhere. It would be great if it could also backup my OneDrive, Google Drive etc. My son is up at Ole Miss, my daughter and son-in-law are in Jacksonville, FL. He is a Marine. One is 5 hours away from me, the other is 10. I want all those pictures and videos of my grandchildren backed up for eternity. We'll print out the most important and store them somewhere safe. I want to be able to access it from my phone from anywhere to see the pictures stored locally on my home computer/Drobo or similar storage device.
  
​
 So - there must be someone on here who is like me and researches this crap until their eyes bleed trying to find the best solution for the very best price. I'm am open to any and all suggestions, even the convoluted ones that are free but require and insane amount of work. Thoughts?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I had been using Cloudflare ZTNA Tunnels to expose a couple of self-hosted apps (Nextcloud and BlueIris) to the internet. They had both been working fine, but I borked my Nextcloud install so have started from scratch using NGINX as the webserver rather than Apache2. 
 I used certbot to install a certificate for the internal domain (lets call it nc.internal.com for now), and it's working great on the local network. I want to use Cloudflare to make it available on the external domain (nc.external.com), so I've set up the DNS record for nc.external.com to point via my tunnel.
 However, whenever I enter nc.external.com into my browser I get the "too many redirects" error, and sure enough I can see lots of 301 Permanently Moved errors.
 My other apps are still working on thei external domains.
 I've tried changing the SSL/TLS settings in Cloudflare to every setting possible (Full (strict), Full, Flexible and Off), but these haven't helped.
 Wondering if anyone has any pointers or ideas?
 Kevin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just purchased 40TB worth of HGST DC320 SATA drives, but a friend is willing to sell me 40TB of some lightly used HGST 7K4000 SAS drives for about the same price. I believe these are older drives and the DC320's have some improvements, what it would be I do not know yet.
 ​
 ~~EDIT~~
 I forgot to mention that an advantage to the SATA drives is that they're under 5yr warranty with the seller, whereas I have no warranty with my friend, they're both used drives however, none of them are new, so there's that...
 ~~End of Edit~~
 ​
 I can return the ones I bought, but my question is, Would it be worth it? Would I need to invest in anything other than an LSI HBA card to get these SAS drives up and running on a desktop LGA 1151 with i5 7400 or is there other components I would need that would make SAS cost more?
 ​
 Second Question; Is there a reliability benefit to SAS? I've read online that they read and write far less errors than SATA equivalent drives do during the drive's lifespan. Hypothetically that would imply less RAID array failures when using Parity right? I'm new to this so I could be wrong.
 ​
 Please let me know if it's worth it or if I should let this deal pass? Thank you!

I was experimenting with unplugging and plugging them in, and I may have accidentally connected one port to another port on the same POE switch. Could this cause a cable modem/router to burn out?
 In general, cycling the power on the POE switch (in order to restart the cameras) seemed to be messing with the overall internet somehow. Today when Spectrum came, they claimed the cable modem/router was toast.

 the premise is this: I upload all my photos and videos to a specific folder in Nextcloud, and I want that those new photos get uploaded on Immich.
 I want to use Immich to browse the photos but Nextcloud has a more robust upload system and has also the desktop client that I use.
 Nextcloud and Immich are both docker containers running on the same server.
 Immich has a CLI service to upload a bunch of photos on a server, and at first I thought to install that on my nextcloud container (and I've tried, it works) but when I update Nextcloud by removing and reinstalling the container all of my work of installing Immich and set up of the syncing get screwed up.
 is it possible to create a docker compose yml file that I can use to update Nextcloud and also install and set up that Immich CLI?
 if not, how do you think I can resolve this problem? I think I have to operate inside the nextcloud container because outside of it I can't access the files
 ​
 ask me anything if it's not clear
 thanks

I am also, unfortunately, at the intersection of "worried about security" and "don't know enough to know what enough security is". I really didn't like the fact that docker ignored my firewall rules and opened ports on the iptables, so I made a custom bridge network and didn't publish any ports. In this way, I had hoped to be able to solely publish ports 80 and 443, routing everything else through the custom docker network. This felt safer. The massive problem with this is that it works - kind of. I can generally get to a service, but not always. However, if I get to them, they will be intermittent at best. They drop a LOT of communications via time out. I tried netdata to see if the system was struggling - seems not at all. I took the services out of the bridge network and published the ports normally - everything works great. This makes me assume I did something wrong on the network. Has anyone seen this before?

I currently have a home server for my media running UnRaid with stuff like plex, jellyfin, a game server, torrents, some monitoring software. On my cloud host, I currently have wireguard, gitlab-ce, and vaultwarden. 
 I am looking for tips of other applications that make good additions to host on the cloud rather than a home server. I could probably move my game server to the cloud to prevent exposing my home IP, haven't decided yet. I have gigabit internet at home but it is capped at 50Mbps upload which really blows.

I set up ngrok (ngrok.io which is now ngrok.com), and signed up for their $60/year plan which I thought was a reasonable price. But now they are charging me over $60/month! I only have a couple of endpoints set up and only transfer a few files per week. I need to get away from this solution as soon as possible. Both of my machines are behind a router NAT / firewall....the typical cable modem with router setup, with public IP addresses that *may* change once in a while.
 So far I'm looking at the following:
 - Wireguard (wireguard.com) for VPN.... will I need a proxy server?
 - For proxy servers if I need one: nginx, or sniproxy -- does this have to be running on a public server space? If so, I do have accounts on dreamhost.com
 - It's not clear to me yet if I need containers...if so I'm looking at linuxcontainers (linuxcontainers.org)
 - ssh reverse tunnels - but seems wireguard is a much better replacement for this
 Thanks for any input!

 I hope everyone has had a great week. For those that have seen and keeping up to date with the Dummies Guides (here & here). They have been a great success thanks to all of you! I am hoping to keep to a Friday schedule.
 My latest is actually something I had to deal with this week in work. Backups!
 Today I'd like to release Duplicati
 https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/017-duplicati/
 I have been working Bitwarden and Vaultwarden but before I release that I need to write a Dummies Guide to Email as we have to deal with SMTP. A subject not so easy to cover.
 Along with that I have been making big changes to the website that eventually will be released to the masses (cleaning up my own questionable code). Check out the Infrastructure page where it's all run by Hugo. Yes you will be able self host and if internet goes down you could start a project.
 Plus I want to hear from you all. I want to know what you are hosting and what should be a dummies guide. I already have a long list but doesn't hurt hearing what you think someone starting should know. You can find that here.
 That's all from me, Happy Self Hosting!

Now I just got back from another trip with 50GB of photos and I wondered if I should build for a streamlined process for new photos and worry about the old ones later.
 So, how do you do it? 
 e.g. I'm thinking use DigiKam to catalog locally and then save onto NextCloud on file server. But I wanna see what people have been using smoothly and successfully first before installing anything.

 Prometheus + Grafana
 Prometheus + Grafana + Netdata
 InfluxDB + Telegraf + Grafana 
 Prometheus collects data. Grafana displays it. When would you need to add Netdata to that? Why would you drop Prometheus and go with both InfluxDB and Telegraf? 
 I need basic CPU, Memory, Storage, and Docker container monitoring for my main server. Would also like to monitor a remote VPS and local Linux clients with a single setup if possible.

 I've got a Sophos box running PfSense and a stack of Cisco 1941 routers, all with 1gb ports, all ports set to 1000full duplex, yet for whatever reason they all seem to cap out just north of 300mbps (sometimes they'll hit like 309, but it's pretty consistent around the 300 mark.)
 I went out and picked up a TP-Link AX55 router. Instantly it jumps to 900+. (Close enough to 1000 that given devices using network bandwidth, all other reasons why you might not get the full speed your ISP promises, and whatever else that I'm happy to say 900-950 is close enough to 1000 for me.). I've used the same cable, from the same port on the ISP modem ( an xb7, I think this one is a technicolor, but I've had comscope ones and there was no change.).
 Modem port is good. Cables are good. Router ports are configured to 1000 full duplex. Multiple routers from multiple companies all get stuck at 300..
 Any ideas where to look next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for good hardware that I can have as a 'go to' recommendation if anyone asks me about setting up a 'server' and keep in mind the people that would be asking about setting up a server aren't going to be tech-savvy, they just want to buy something, throw it on a shelf and 'hopefully' have it work.
 I'm thinking either a NUC or mac mini.
 I know there are people that only have mac products which is why I mention the mac mini, they may not want to add a NUC (likely with a windows OS) into their environment.
 Here is my concern. In any scenario where there is a media server, the idea/goal is to get the content to direct play on the client side. Typically the client devices are an nvidia shield or an apple TV and 95% of the time I'd say those devices direct play (they are hard wired). They seem to only switch to transcoding when subtitles are involved or if the audio stream needs to be changed for some reason.
 I'm looking to see which NUC and/or if a mac mini would act as a good server if it ever had to transcode. The last thing I want to do is recommend a 1k server device and have it lock up while transcoding.
 Some additional information
  
no remote users, only local play (meaning, the library is not shared and won't have other family/friends streaming/transcoding/etc)
 very rare that more than one stream will be active at a time
 decent amount of UHD content, but being on the LAN (all devices are wired) as long as the client can direct play, I don't see 4k being an issue
  
I wasn't sure where else to post this because this is more of a hardware question vs a media server question. For transcoding purposes, am I looking for something with a built in video card or is the CPU more critical? Or both?
 Thanks.

It took some trial and error to get a fully functioning Synapse server up and running on my Raspberry Pi 4, as well as a self-hosted Element client, Postgres database, and TURN server so that voice and video calls work.
 After I got it all working, I decided to automate the process and roll it into an operating system image for the Pi. I named the project Feta and I put together a little website and a walkthrough video which is up on https://www.feta.bz/
 It runs a setup script on first boot so all you have to do is type in your domain name and email address. It configures everything automatically and generates SSL certificates using Certbot.
 So far I've tested it on a Raspberry Pi 3 and 4.

 The requirements are (in no particular order): * Easy to use, low maintenance * Support for docker (including custom containers) * High reliability * Support for Time Machine (AFAIK, any SMB share can be used for that) * Something like an „App Store“ with simplified installations would be a nice bonus * There are no plans for a media server, so storage requirements are fairly moderate
 Storage will likely end up being a couple of mirrored 2Tb SATA SSDs or 4-6TB HDDs with an offsite backup (likely to my place).

 - video server displaying/recording data from few (say up to 5) cameras. In my understanding it's just a piece of software accepting several streams, archiving and having simple UI to show current/historical streams.
 - no cloud / proprietary solutions, only deployable and/or opensource
 - something that supports wide range of cameras, including ones with PTZ
 - ideally with mobile app, but simple UI would be fine
 If someone can recommend CCTV cameras (including PTZ and sound) would be great. Currently have no idea where to look - thousands of cameras, tens of standards....
 Buying a cheap camera with "cloud and app" is not a solution as it is plain invasion of privacy. I don't want to share my streams with uknown people (hence opensource).
 Please nudge me in right direction. thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow self-hosters,
 I've just gone through the process of putting my containers behind Traefik but I can switch to nginx proxy manager too if necessary for my needs.
 Im just trying to set this up right to have a good foundation. I need a seamless SSO experience for my family but I'm not sure whether to pick Authentik or Authelia. I have services which support LDAP/auth integration like HomeAssistant and I also have things like Radarr. So I need to throw all of these behind SSO and maybe have some sort of domain control for users in LDAP to only allow access to what they need.
 In terms of LDAP, I've only really looked into openLdap. If there's anything better then please let me know. Don't wanna run into headaches managing my homelab later on, it's a pain 🥲. But fun!
 Thanks a lot for reading, if you don't have any ideas that's okay!

 I can use these three slots with adapters to connect 3x of these drives. I assume for the rest I would need to use the 16x PCI-E slots. I have 2 GPUs in this which blocks all but 1 PCI-E slot. I know I can get a PCI-E to SAS NVME dual and go that route. However, that gets me to 5. I would like to connect all 8x. At this point I am trying to figure out if there is a PCI-E raid card I can go with that will host connectors for all 8x or at least 6x of the intel NVME SAS hard drives.
 Does anyone know of a card that can do this (looking to keep max read/write speeds)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So ARM has been touted as the low power low cost datacenter and server solution for nigh on a decade now, supposed to cut the cost of a server by a factor of ten to buy and another factor of ten to run. So now that the ARM ecosystem has had the time to age like a fine milk, what's a good Homelab ARM server platform to buy into? I'm looking for something to run a full fledged VM and/or Kubernetes cluster on. I want to be able to run a few 4 core 8GB VMs at a time on a node, so the rPi is out, as are most of the SBC solutions I know of. I'm also not looking to build up a bunch of 3D printed or CNCd cases to put things that were never meant to be in a rack, well, into a rack. So here's some rough critera:
  
1U, 2U, or SFF formfactor (Think Project Tiny Mini Micro, small black boxes that can sit two side by side on a 1U rack shelf)
 16 cores in a node, though preferably more like 32 threads (With or without Hyperthreading)
 Easily upgraded with DDR3 or DDR4 ECC RDIMMs off the shelf. I would like to be able to buy some DIMMs and upgrade the RAM in my existing nodes if I decide I want to expand the lab.
 10GBE SFP+ built in OR multiple PCIE slots in the chassis to be able to add in my own PCIE cards
 Options to run multiple HDDs (preferably 2.5" SSDs though even just a pair of m.2 slots would be good enough for a basic node
 Under $1000 for a node, though $200-400 would be even better as I want to buy many of them.
  
I'm sure I'm asking too much here, given the promised price, performance, and power consumption that comes with the ARM datacenter revolution, but it would be nice to start deploying ARM at home now that it's a few generations old.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking to build a home server when I move out and so far I know my way around pretty well but I am a little confused with this one part.
 Using Docker, I want to host a personal cloud with Nextcloud*, a media server with Jellyfin that I want to connect to Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett and Transmission and a music server using Navidrome among other things that I don't need help with right now. The part where I'm lost is storage, do I have to or should I have some NAS software running under all of this like OMV or TrueNAS (or is that not how it works and I misunderstood something) and can all these apps access files from each other if they are all set up on the same drives if I tell them for which folder to look**?
 For example would I be able to upload music or videos directly to Nextcloud to a folder Navidrome or Jellyfin can access or would I have to use something like Samba (in the case I'm not using a tool like sonarr)?
 *I want to hold most of my files on there so I don't have many important things on my PC because I like messing around with my operating systems so I can quickly reinstall them whenever I want to, if there is any better software for this purpose, please let me know
 ** I'm planning on using 2 4tb hard drives in RAID 1 for now unless somebody thinks I should do some different setup

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm rebuilding my lab and using it as an opportunity to go a (lot) overkill: new NAS with SAS instead of SATA. I'm still planning on self-built though since I lack both budget and physical space for a 4-post rack.
 The SAS controller I'm looking at (MegaRAID 9560-8i) has an SFF-8654 (SlimSAS) connector, and I'm not sure how to go about connecting that to eight internal 12GB/s SAS drives that don't have any kind of backplane (just direct connections).
 I've found 8654 to eight SATA and 8654 to four SAS, but not 8654 to eight SAS.
 I would be fine with SATA performance-wise, so am I just creating unnecessary headache for myself?

 Hey everybody, so I found this deal for recertified 14TB hard drives from server part deals. It's also a serial number that had a pretty good track record from black blaze. I know I should be extra careful around recertified drives but I'm wondering if $10/TB is a good enough price point to take a risk? Has anyone here bought recertified drives from server part deals?
 Is recertified a complete deal breaker? 
 I'm sure I can wait for a ~$15/TB sale in the coming weeks on new drives but $140 seems like it might be worth it, what do you all think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey hoarders,
 I have got a legal question (Based in Germany and Netherlands. Service would be available EU wide.) 
 But first disclaimer: I will obviously not take any answer as legally credible ones. I am just looking for some guidance and knowledge.
 I plan on renting out some storage to some friends and friends of friends (at first). What are the potential pitfalls doing so? I am thinking for example, what if someone uploads a copyrighted movie and uses my platform to share it. (I think this is the most likely scenario to happen, but you guys can maybe think of more) 
 What am I to do, to prevent malicious use and what am I responsible for? What kind of legal charges could be made against me if a user uses my service like this.
 I own a registered business and would make individual contracts with each user including sending out invoices etc. So I know every user by name, adress and bank details at least. I think that should prevent the most evil kind of malicious use but I am still worried about some of the lesser ones. 
 Every thought about this topic is appreciated. 
 Cheers and happy hoarding

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to set these up in the most seamless way possible. I have no desire to store my totally legal linux ISOs permanently. I'd rather just watch them sit there for about 2 hours and then delete them.
 The ideal set up for me would be to find what I want on Jellyseer, request it, and immediatly be able to hop on to Jellyfin and start watching. The way I have it right now feels kinda wonky.
 Jellyseer doesn't update the request status, ever, it always says "requested", but things do get added to their respective *arr apps. But then, the *arr app may not find what I want, even tho I can go into prowlarr, manually search for it, and find it immediately. Why is that?
 Also, I have configured qbittorrent to do sequential downloads. That way I can see the Linux ISO form right in front of my eyes, byte by byte, which lets me enjoy it as soon as it begins downloading.
 The problem with that, is that the *arr apps won't move the file until it's completely finished downloading, so Jellyfin doesn't see it. I set up a workaround by adding qbit download folder to Jellyfin, and that works, and I can start watching immediatly, but it's wonky, and things aren't properly separated.
 Has someone done something similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says.
 I picked up a Dell R220 and Dell R230 earlier this year for a proxmox cluster and I've been pretty pleased with them, especially for about $200~ each. 
 Lately I've been considering buying a NAS like a Synology 4 bay NAS to store things like my raw photos and videos (I do photography), music and movies.
 Well, the R230 specifically has 4 removable HDD bays on the front, is more powerful, and considerably cheaper. Could another R230 be a decent solution? 
 I don't have much experience with the free nas software solutions (except OMV, which im not that fond of). But I have heard good things about Synologys software. 
 Thoughts?

is this idea even feasible regarding patents or some other IP protection issue?
 is there an company that would make and sell boards? My company would provide SoC and is already working on Linux kernel support for our chips.
  
I think the homelab market is large enough to get products catered specifically to it, but I’m also a biased homelabber. Are there other semi-niche products that people want?

 it aint much but its honest work 🥲. I did kind of cheat, using OMV as my base, but idc for now
 mainly did this so my dad can move away from google drive and use this NAS for continuously backing up his business files and his video files for his yt channel (its like 1tb of stuff).

 Tried Rustdesk (the only one meeting my criteria on awesome-selfhosted), and hated it since the quality was absolute garbage, at least on their hosted offering, and I don't have any faith in the self-hosted offering after that. I'm considering Guacamole, but that's just a client to standard protocols like RDP/VNC so I'm not sure how well it works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I’m Joseph; an engineer at Appsmith. We have quite a few repos in our GitHub organization and tracking issues can be a bit challenging. So when our GraphQL integration launched recently, this seemed like the perfect use case to build a new internal tool for our team.
  
Appsmith is an open-source framework to quickly build any custom business software like admin panels, internal tools, dashboards, and more with pre-built UI widgets that connect to any database, GraphQL or REST API, controlling everything with Javascript. Appsmith can be self-hosted and runs on Docker, K8s.
  
I’ve documented the build process for anyone looking to get started with Appsmith, or GitHub’s GraphQL API. This tutorial covers:
 GraphQL
  
Enabling GitHub’s GraphQL API and creating an access token
 Building queries with the GitHub GraphQL Explorer
 Using GraphQL query variables
 Using the authenticated GraphQL API in Appsmith
 Presenting the data in a dashboard
  
JavaScript
  
Using the Array map() method in JavaScript
 Using Object.keys() to get an array of the field names
 Using the Reduce method to make a pivot table
 Using the ternary operator to conditionally flatten nested data

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm kinda curious how many people have, or are genuinely interested in high density compute servers for homelab use. I suspect the number will be quite low given their numerous downsides such as noise, inefficiency, inflexibility, cost... All for the sake of density which isn't as big of a factor in a homelab. I mean sure, it would be nice if you could double your existing compute power in the same rack, but it's not going to cost you as much as it would cost a datacenter to get another rack.
 I don't hate myself or my neighbors enough to buy or run a normal blade server lol. But if I got to customize one to a ridiculous extent then I'd be interested in a tower style mini rack, sorta like the Dell VRTX. With maybe 4, 8 or even 16 nodes with high core count CPUs running at low clocks to keep the temps and noise reasonable while maintaining high multithreaded throughput, and a GPU to offload some stuff onto... Sounds like a dream.

 I'm running the Sonarr / Radarr / Prowlarr docker stack and I'd like to find an app/integration to easily discover new series and movies in my language and available as torrent at the moment of searching.
 I've already thought about importing Trakt.tv lists, but it's not a solution for me because I have the free account and can't make advanced searches / filtering so I cannot discover by language. Besides, Trakt.tv has no reference to torrents, so it would show all shows / movies regardless the availability as torrent.
 Any suggestion?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making some server management software, to replace cpanel and automate my home servers. It's free and open source. The concept is, it only takes a millisecond or two to generate config files on the fly, so why not do that. Any important information, such as domain names and user names are stored in a single json file. I wrote a tool in rust which takes this information and inserts it into config templates. A single command installs the software, then the whole thing is already working.
 The web control panel is an optional package, and each service is also a separate package, you only install what you need. I wrote an install script with a menu to make it easy. The install script will also have an autonomous mode which can install the required packages without any interaction, which makes it easy to use with docker.
 I'm still working on the web control panel and a bunch more services. Currently I have dns hosting with named/bind, web hosting with nginx, haproxy, php-fpm, and lets encrypt, and email hosting using postfix. Websites are hosted each with an independent user and nginx instance. All this is configured automatically as each service starts. I'm working on adding support for hosting minecraft servers, managing backups and zfs pools, and other services as needed.
 Aside from a few bugs I'm still working on, my own use of the software has been smooth sailing. Hoping to continue work on it and make something great. The source code is currently private, while I still have some security concerns, but can grant access on request. I have faith in open source. I named it configer.io

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 I'm testing the solution in the title. My goal is having a simple to-do list app that saves data on a selfhosted service and allows the sharing of the lists. Using Radicale as a backend and Tasks.org as mobile app, everything works easily. I evaluate several solutions and this is the better one: Radicale is mature and updated, tasks.org connect to it without the need of DavX5 or other things. Very very good.
 Now, the problem is that the basic docker default config of Radicale does not have any kind of users management, in the login page you just insert a name (and no pwd, even if the field exists...) and if the username exists, you are enabled to see and manage (delete too) all its items; if it does not, a new user is created!
 As said I read some docs but I do not understand too much: I just need that users should have a password and that only users I authorize can login, so no automatic user creation. It seems I have to specify "users list" and "users config file" in the "radicale config file"; "users config file" details resources access for users.
 So, the question is: how have you solved this situation? Might you publish the config files you have? I just need 3-4 private calendars for family members and one shared.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a home file-server around for years, but only a few months ago started using monitoring/alarms on it. I've noticed that every day my HDDs record a peak temp of 65C around 7am. I looked at the manual for these Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 HDDs, which states that they shouldn't exceed 60*C for prolonged use. My HDD temp regularly exceeds 60C between 2am-3pm (!)
 My questions are: * Is this a reasonable operating temperature? Am I worrying over nothing?
  
I already have two fans blowing over these hard drives, is there anything else I can do to keep the temperatures down (preferably not liquid cooling)
 
This temp spike seems totally unrelated to system activity. No spikes reads/writes, network calls, spikes in number of processes or cpu. I can't think of any other signals of "this server is working hard". I'm usually asleep when this happens, I'm totally baffled why this temp spike is happening. Can anyone think of any other reason the HDD temp would spike?
 
 Thank you for the help friends

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I'm currently backing up my entire Blu Ray collection using MakeMKV. I'm not creating MKV files but create a backup of the entire disk. A friend of mine is really commited using DVDFab. This brings me to my first question:
 Do both create a lossless backup of the Blu Ray or does one create a better output (wheter it being the folder structure or a packed iso)?
 Also, while I constantly check the revision history of MakeMKV, is it possible that future updates create better outputs or are the current ones already completely lossless? And if so, is there a way to compare the disk with the created backup to check if there has been an bugs which created a quality loss (for example by not copying some files)
 A little exkurs - do DVDFab, AnyDVD and MakeMKV differ in the creation of the output (video files like mkv) talking about quality or are they same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I've got 1000+ CC BY-licensed short video clips from an event that's useful as stock footage. They are organised into folders by date, where each folder's size is 50 GB to 100+ GB, and total size is just over 600 GB.
 I'd love to upload these clips to the Internet Archive, but the web uploader doesn't work well for huge uploads like this.
 I know there's the command line client, but have no idea about how to most efficiently upload so many files with a huge total size like this.
 Any tips on how to do this? E.g. should I break this up into different items or collections, and how to upload the files in bulk???
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently moved away from Synology to a server running Ubuntu and ZFS (for reasons). 
 One of the things I was using however that worked reasonably well was Synology’s Drive client. I have a few directories that I need to keep data synced to share amongst a few windows machines. Drive did this pretty well. 
 I’ve looked around a bit, and the options seem slim in comparison to the same experience I had with drive. Here’s some of the things I’ve considered:
  
 rclone, currently top of the list. Doesn’t quite capture my requirements, but could mash something up scheduler to sync a few times a day or something 
  Freefilesync, bravo for open source but looks clunky
  Syncthing, love the concept, but hate the idea of having to run a client on the NAS. I also don’t need the data encrypted in transit
  Bypass all this nonsense and just store my data directly on the share. The only problem with this approach is there are times when I am mobile with no connectivity and still need a locally cached copy to work from to sync back later. 
  
I’ve seen a few paid for options as well which I am not opposed to, but wanted to get an idea from folks that may have followed a similar path as myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, so something I have been thinking about recently is starting to build and sell custom pc systems. I’m looking at starting with making NAS servers. Instead of purchasing (for example) a Synology NAS and then installing drives. Would you consider purchasing a custom solution at a cheaper price (for comparable specs) or more/better specs for the same price?
 An initial build plan comes to around £600 but provides 4 x 4TB ironwolf drives in Raid 5 for a total storage capacity of about 12TB. Plus the ability to run additional ‘modules’ on the server to allow for more than just NAS functionality.
 Any suggestions/feedback or ideas are welcome. Currently in the scoping out phase.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of setting up my first homelab. I purchased a Dell R430. It came with an H730 raid controller running the 4 2TB drives. I want to swap it out for an HBA330 so I can run TrueNas Core. I've spent way more time than I should have today on google trying to figure out if the H730 cable will work with the HBA330 to no avail. Can anyone confirm that the current cable will work?

 . I've never restored an image from Macrium before, but I've watched a few videos on the process.
 currently I'm just verifying the image
 My concern is, I'm fairly certain there's some issues with Windows itself, and I'm not entirely sure when this began. My concern is the backup has these issues too. 
 *My question is, * I'm not sure if macrium will automatically reinstall Windows (I believe it simply "copies" the windows partition). I have a removable drive with Windows Boot Media currently plugged into the system. Do I need to use it, or will I be asked if I want to reinstall windows during the image restore process?
 Or something else?

 Has anyone built sth similar like this?
 This post is specifically about getting/archiving the data of the big providers.
 What i have figured out so far in regarding 2d google maps & bing:
 The data is served in 256x256 jpeg files that you can directly download with your webbrowser via inspect, but they all have a unique (probably random) id / download link.
 So you would just need a script to auto download and tag/name them according to their position on the world and zoom/detail level, do you know any already existing programs that could achieve that?
 And yes i know this is going to be (depending on the coverage) a very storage intensive task.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Afternoon legends,
 I've currently got my Unraid server in a 4U case (Silverstone RM400)
 in my rack, running a Ryzen 5 3600/32gb RAM,GTX 1070+drives). ie, standard server.
 I've recently gotten my hands on some free stuff from a mate. An i9 9900K, Strix ATX motherboard and 32gb RAM. I've been wanting to create a second server with a higher clock speed for things like dedicating game servers, instead of using Windows VM's within Unraid, due to the Windows processing/RAM overhead.
 Additional things I'll need will be Case, PSU, CPU Cooler. I'll add an existing drive I have.
 My initial thoughts were another 4U case, but I wanted to keep costs down, and I likely will only have 1 drive in it so seems like a big waste of space.
 3U or 2U cases could work, but I don't know about their height clearance for CPU coolers, and they don't seem that much cheaper. I could even look into cheap cases off aliexpress as I could probably wait (but shipping is crazy $$ to Australia)
 I thought about an old PC tower off marketplace, reuse the PSU, cooler and lie the case on it's side. But not sure about height/width or aesthetics. Is there a minimalist rack case I can add an ATX board to?
 I'd love to know your thoughts/tips on the best way to add/build this second server?

 I have a nearly unused, shuckable 14TB external drive I got a good deal on maybe half a year ago. I registered the warranty on it and did a disk test but never used it.
 I'm thinking of selling it but I don't want the buyer to shuck it and return scam. The only solution I see is either 1. trust that it won't happen or 2. get some sort of tamper proof tape and say in the description I won't accept returns with the tape broken.
 Appreciate any thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently running a VPS (Ubuntu) and a home server (unraid). I have loads of services, apps and self written software running on both systems. On the VPS are probably around 15 Things running.
 Anything that has a high reliability requirement and especially when it requires fast internet runs on my VPS. Currently it's a mess, things running with docker compose, things running with docker run (so the configuration is floating in space) and some things just barebone installed and running in some process managers or systemctl, messing with each other and breaking apt-get requirements.
 I'm planning to restructure everything into containerization, just unsure how. 
 I have seen people use portainer (tried it, wasn't flashed), kubernetes (does that even make sense here? Sadly don't know a lot about it) or just plain docker-compose files and running commands.
 Is there some sort of guide/comparison that compares different approaches and their use cases. Would also be interested on the opinions of others, I'm really unsure about this.
 My time is fairly limited so I don't want to spend weeks trying different approaches or having to switch between them because something didn't work out.
 Thanks for any replies

I can use proxmox which I already have and throwing things to influx but I'm not as familiar with it as I am with vmware. 
 Basically the hypervisor is going to be running my firewall and a few other proxies applications. THe ability to snapshot the firewall is also a bonus so I can upgrade and revert when I do upgrades.
 ...hmm..I wonder if vmware does online license checks...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is it possible to learn Azure in a home lab? We're starting to do more and more with it at work. The big guns at work are in the somewhat early stages of setup and I want to learn it so I can know what's going on.
 I wanted to just see if I could get a list of computers from Azure AD. I just tried to connect by working with Microsoft Graph. Following Microsoft's docs I got to the sign in part with setting the scope. It prompted me about making changes for the organization. Obviously I cancelled the sign in real quick. I could ask the other guys but I want to know a little before doing so. I was going to purchase some courses on Udemy or somewhere but none of them are working examples. Staring at Powerpoint slides with nothing to refer to is not helpful.
 I have a MSDN subscription so I get $50 a month of Azure that I haven't used a dollar of for the past I don't know how many years. Obviously I also have a full Windows home lab in my home lab environment. Running commands like above I would have to issue running in my home lab.
 As I said I am starting from ground 0 mind you. Do you have any suggestions or links that could help me? Any courses? Any help would be appreciated.
 One more thing I've been tasked for 2023 to start managing our on-prem devices with Intune and patching from Intune. One of the best things I've done is setup our current asset management tool and patching solution in my home lab. I been able to test a lot of cases without affecting our production environment.

 I currently have a tiny server that runs a few services like Firefly for finances management. These are highly sensitive informations, and I need them to be protected if the server ever gets stolen.
 What is the best way to encrypt as most data as possible, knowing that the server is entirely headless (so I only access it through SSD)?
 Encrypting the /home folder is not enough since most sensitive data comes from Docker's volumes. Also whatever I do I need to have a way to input the encryption passphrase through SSH.
 I didn't find any way to perform a full-disk encryption and then input LUKS passphrase when connecting through SSH after reboot.
 Does anyone know a way to do this?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just bought my first house, and it's finally time to graduate from my crappy old gaming PC stuffed in the closet to a proper server setup. I've got almost 800 square feet of basement space, plenty of room to fit at least a half height server rack. But now that I have the space for a rack, I'm questioning if it's even the right choice? I figured I could get old rack mounted servers for cheap off ebay, but most of what I'm finding for cheap is almost 10 years old. Wondering if it would be better to just build a small desktop with a more modern CPU to handle the tasks I have in mind, which are:
  
Various game servers: Minecraft, Terraria, Quake 3, etc.
 Video/Music storage (~20TB)
 Nextcloud
 Jellyfin
 Home security DVR
 Plus a handful of other smaller VMs/containers.
  
Energy costs are pretty cheap where I am so I'm not super concerned about the power draw, and since this will be in my basement noise isn't a factor either.
 What are your thoughts, anybody go with rack mount and hate it? Or go with desktops and find out you didn't have enough space for something?

 My NAS has two 4TB drives which are full. I am using them for back up of my personal/family photos and videos. Occasionally I use the NAS to stream some videos to my TV. I don’t use the NAS for anything other than that. Since buying a new camera, my storage capacity is filling up very quickly. 
 It’s very important to me that I don’t lose these files so I have the drives set in RAID1. (I’ve been reading up on this subreddit and I am also going to make an extra copy on an external hard drive to store at another location.)
 Using a NAS for this has really been working great for me since I don’t need to worry about backing up or anything, I am always sure that my files are stored on 2 drives. 
 What should I do? These are the options as I see them:
 Option 1 is to buy new drives with bigger capacity and use these to replace the drives I already have. 
 Option 2 is to buy a NAS with 4 bays. Keep my 2 existing drives and buy 2 new drives to expand the volume. 
 Are these options any good? Maybe you guys have different suggestions? Thanks!

 Do you install Tailscale on all the machines you want to access through the VPN, or do you have a dedicated entry point with tailscale installed, for accessing the rest of your internal network?
 I'm trying to get my head around how I can remotely log into my network and access all the resources, as it would be with a traditional VPN connection. From what I understand, I would either need to install Tailscale on each machine or use a jump host from which I can use all the resources within my network.

 I am going to buy 5 new servers from scaleway 
 Pro-6-M (Intel® Xeon E3 1240v6 - 64 Gb RAM - 3 x 1 Tb SSD - 2 Gigabit Ethernet ports each server).
 The second Lan of each server can be used for private network between servers with jumbo frame support.
 What's the best configuration for max and best resource utilization?
 I prefer ESXI but Proxmox is an option too.
 Also if needed i can buy some more vSAN storage for backup purposes...
 I need to run about 20 Windows VMs with 200GB storage and about 16Gb ram each.

As a result I have amassed a decent amount of metadata in my iTunes library (#of plays, date added to the library, last played, rating) are the most important ones
 I'm looking for a selfhosting server solution that:
 1) Lets me migrate my music files and keeps the associated iTunes library data mentioned above (this is very important to me)
 2) Can play/stream music from any device, as I use my desktop and android device the most for music playback
 3) Ease of database (ie. library data) organization, so I can easily manage backups and adding/removing music

 I'm finally at the point where I have enough services on my rebuilt network to need some kind of centralised authentication platform.
 In the past I've tried out both Keycloak and FusionAuth, and I'm now looking at Authentik, but I have one slight problem - I've got less than 1G RAM left available on the box I want to run it on, and they all seem to require more than that.
 Is there anything out there (apart from OpenLDAP which was a nightmare to install/maintain last I tried it!) that is lightweight and provides LDAP Authentication? 
 I don't really need 2FA or similar, and I'd rather not run Authelia because a lot of the apps I'm running don't appear to support auth headers.
 Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So guys here is the question that truly want to know your answer to. What is reason for choosing your remote access setup and why is your way more secure than the next guys way.
 My remote access setup! I chose not to use a VPN, I created a domain name, used cloud flare for dns, setup a Ubuntu VM on my proxmox with cloudron image, and use Apache guacamole. Keep in mind I had to use my public IP for DNS, then I forward port 80,443 from my router to my Ubuntu VM.
 Problem, I don’t like the exposure and with cloudron they recommend not updating the image as they push their own security updates to the machine every night. Is this good or bad to rely on someone else to patch any new vulns or is it better that way since I’ll more than likely be late applying any patches.
 I really don’t like having any open ports on my ingress but seems like to remote access any network this needs to happen.
 Questions, comments, SECURITY CONCERNS?
 P.S. thanks in advance, looking forward to all the wisdom

This document is a work in progress and will evolve as I gain more experience and find more interesting stuff to do. I do not intend this repository to be taken as a tutorial because I don't consider myself an expert in this area.
 Use the information provided in this repository at your own risk. I take no responsibility for any damage to your equipment. Depending on my availability, I can support if asked in solving issues with your software, but be prepared to troubleshoot stuff that don't work on your own. My recommendation is to take the information that I provide here and adapt it to your own needs and hardware.

 I welcome any suggestions for improvements!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a collection of Docker containers running on a NAS which run a reverse proxy, plex, an *arr stack, etc. Sometimes Plex can max out the CPU when transcoding so I am in need of more compute. Ideally, I would just buy better equipment but I'm not in the financial situation to do that and I already have two Raspberry Pi 4Bs that aren't being utilized. Would it be worth the overhead to migrate to a swarm with my two Pis and NAS? It might be nice to have it set up now so that once I have my finances straighted out, I can add another node with better specs without much fuss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I normally buy Seagate hard drives and have had good experience with their RMAs, especially since they still include return shipping as part of their Advanced RMA program (at least they did last year) and their staff is on-shore in North America.
 One of myWD Red 10TB died over the weekend in my unRAID setup after <2 years of service so I setup an Advanced RMA for $25 USD, so far so good, but the drive that they sent me was DOA, it won't even boot - can't be recognized in my USB dock nor in my server's SATA slots. So much for being "certified".
 DOA should not be a problem right?
 Most companies will take care of customers when it's their issue, so I call up WD, and they say:
  
There can only be one Advanced RMA outstanding
 They will setup a standard RMA for the DOA replacement
 They want me to ship the DOA replacement and then WD will send the replacement - so much for "Advanced RMA".
  
I paid $25 for Advanced RMA, and I got nothing out of it except a DOA drive - now I have to wait 2+ weeks for a replacement drive. Amazing they're so inflexible with their RMA system, I guess that's what happens when all the staff is outsourced overases.
 I'm surprised at the bias towards WD, especially with how poor their RMA process is. This alone is going to put me off buying WD drives for my NAS even if Seagate supposedly has a higher failure rate (which they may, but replacements are easy to come by!).
 Anyone else facing troubles with WD RMAs?
 I have about 50 - 60 drives in my various NAS devices, and this is the second time in a row that I've had issues with WD RMAs, during 2020, it took several months to get my RMA back, and the lack of communication and inflexiblity of their RMA department doesn't seem to be addressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time self hosting so bear with me. 
 Setup so far: AT&T fiber, windows host, Ubuntu 22.04LTSServer guest, host Ethernet and Oracle Virtual Box.
 First hurdle: unable to get host to ping the IP seen in the guest. Default is NAT but from other posts, sounds like I need host only or Bridged mode. If I choose Bridge mode, IP shows 127.0.0.1 in host. What am I missing? Didn’t get a chance to dig deeper into this yet.
 Later on, this guest will host a web server exposed to internet. AT&T fiber’s router IP and default block remains pretty static. I am hoping to use one of the other IPs (public subnet) for the guest OS. Can I do that or the host has to be in the public subnet? Is there a way for my other machines in my private network to talk this host/guest via windows explorer or any easier way? Again, not much research done here. 
 Those are questions to start with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for yet another thread about it.
 I've read through a lot of previous posts and seen a lot of recommendations.. But can't seem to find much that differentiates one from the other beyond 'I use it and it works.'
 I currently have EaseUS. And... well... It's time I move on. 
 I'm looking for something I can use to restore from bare metal in the event of a drive failure, with a secondary use for getting older versions of files or something I've deleted and decide I want again.
 Primarily, I'm looking for something that has great compression / de duplication. Keep the archive as small as possible. I'm willing to trade higher compression / smaller size for a longer restore time.
  
Incremental / daily backups too. 
 
I'm fine with paid, though I would prefer something I own outright and isn't contingent on a subscription.
 
Big bonus would be if I can back up directly to a network share, though that's not a deal-breaker for me.
 
I see veeam and macrium thrown around a lot. But I'm unclear on the usability differences between them. Or if there's newer/better stuff.
 
It must have encryption on it of some sort. I don't put anything off-site that isn't encrypted, so this one is a need-to-have.
 
 Anyways I've looked at enough suggestions that now I'm a bit overwhelmed and could really use some guidance. Help?

 My special requirements:
  
use the photos from specified folders, without moving them around
 support tagging of photos (OK to store the tags elsewhere from the actual photos)
 is web-based (running on a remote Linux server)
  
No interest on mobile apps or how to upload new photos, I have scripts that do all this. The simpler solution, the better (e.g. better sqlite than postgres) !
 PS. I guess I'll be hearing about the usual suspects (Photoprism, Photostructure, Piwigo, etc.) if they meet my needs, but I may also get a rare exotic answer...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning an upgrade on my setup. A 4 node S2D/Hyper-v cluster consiting of R620s with infiniband interconnect and either a SSD/HDD hybrid or pure SSD setup. This is depending on what SSD's i can find and to what price.
 The SSDs need Power Loss Protection (else S2D complains and it's a bad time). Other than that, they need pretty high write endurance, especially if I'm using them as cache (at least 3 DWPD or 4 TBW per day according to Microsoft, though I doubt I'll actually manage to come close to this).
 If I can get the 8 bay version of the R620 them 2 bays will be for boot (raid 1). Then depending on the setup either for hybrid: 2 bays for SSD cache and 4 for HDD capacity, or for all flash: 4 for SSD capacity, 2 for scale-up. (This drivecount is the minimum required by Microsoft).
 I've been looking at intel Ark, and the p3700/p3600/p3500 series seem ok, but they are NVMe and I feel that is a waste. Considering the backplanes can have up to SAS 2 speeds (6 gb/s), thousands of mb/s is just unusable potential.
 I also don't have too much money, so those nvme drives are a good bit pricy.
 If anyone has any recs I'll gladly take them!

 im a big fan of selfhosting , and sysadmin/linux in general
 im trying to use kubernetes in my local machines , and those are some great tools that i found but -sometimes the use of them in combinaison is confusing
 i tried the redhat stack : alma , cockpit , openstack and openshift , with also ansible tower
 this looked fun but i could not install openshift origin (okd) maybe i will try with crc , the problem is that crc can not be used for multinode cluster
 ​
 then i used also alma with cockpit but this time with rancher k3s and the goat "Portainer"
 it as quite easy to setup but i do not know if it is production ready , with some netdata or grafana monitoring (i will look at elk too)
 ​
 but now , im quite confused , is openstack open ? can i install it locally on a 8 cores cpu and 16 gb ram
 can i install OKD on a virtual mahcine without fedora or RH CoreOS
 ​
 what is ubuntu openstack and is it free to use in local ?
 and finally , ubuntu juju with a great ui but i actually dont know what is used for 
 ​
 simple question too, is using rancherOS better than setuping multiple vms with cockpit and use one of them or even the main machine as the k3s master node for orchestration ?
 what is your deployment stack right now ? im really curious to know what stack are being used to selfhost

 I was thinking of making a browser extension that marked images in your browser window that are already present on your hard drive (or similar).
 For those who have vast amounts of images, and like to collect them (whichever the type, ahem), I think this would be something useful for the completionists.
 Is there interest for something like this, or do you know of something similar that already exists? Coding it would be fairly challenging though, as performance would be paramount of course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have recently been looking into hosting game servers publicly. While also not leaving myself open to any attacks.
 I have an AWS EC2 instance up and running and have Wireguard running between it and my local network. To be more specific I have my local machine connected to the VPS. The VPS has iptables to move UDP traffic on both 16261 and 16262.
 I have also configured Traefik to forward the data to the correct server. I cannot seem to establish a connection to the game server. I have tested with both a VPN on my client to make sure I am connecting from the outside internet and without the VPN. In the diagram I want data to flow in via the blue line through all the respective connections. Then the red line out and back to the client so they can play on the server.
 I also realize that this can pose some latency issues and an inability to ban by IP. I really could care less about that. I want to mitigate DDoS or any form of attack that isn't based on an exploit in the game. If the game has an exploit then that is a whole other issue I will worry about. This is about minimizing the attack surface not the optimal way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys quick question that may be dumb but I’ve never built a pc. The Corsair HX850 has 6 peripheral/sata ports but only comes with 4 Sata cables. I see a lot of talk about using sata power splitters, but couldn’t I just buy a couple extra Sata power cables from Corsair? 
 Is there anything I’m missing here? How many drives can I power on the HX850? 5v @ 25amp on this psu.
 I’m probably gonna have this PSU powering only Sata drives in a DAS box. Might have to save a sata/peripheral port for the HBA expander. Is that gonna be a problem electric wise since I’m not powering any 12v components? And how does the switch for single or multiple 12v rails work for my use case? 
 Any tips would be appreciated thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking into a way to get a virtual lab up and running so I can practice PowerShell scripting with an Active Directory and Exchange Server linked together (where the AD accounts are linked to the e-mail accounts in Exchange). I'm relatively new to IT as I started working helpdesk two years ago, so I'm fairly certain I don't have the know-how to build something entirely from scratch which leaves me feeling stuck and not knowing how to move forward. I've done my research and looked at tutorials and it all really goes over my head. As far as I can tell, there isn't any instant gratification type of solution where you can get a VM with AD and Exchange already built in ready for you to use. There's trial versions you can download, but they eventually expire and I'm not sure how affordable it is to keep paying for it once the trial runs out. For someone in my position, what are the things I should start learning so I can get to the point where I can eventually build a lab on my own, and be able to construct my own environment that mimics a production server? I appreciate the feedback as I'm a total noob and this question probably sounds sort of naïve.

 I’ve now been bitten by the homelab bug, ordered myself a few Sliger rack mount cases along with components for an purely air cooled solution, to run virtualised stuff under Proxmox.
 How do you set up your fans and fan control so they are not spinning up constantly in relation to short lived CPU temp spikes. A constant speed fan profile in the bios, or….?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there! 
 So I have been running TrueNAS Scale for a good while now, and I am running into the issue that at idle it is using 15GB RAM for god knows what, in addition to whatever is available for ZFS caching. With only 32GB of RAM I quite often find myself unable to use more than 12GB of my 32GB for apps/VMs. This is quite frustrating to say the least. 
 With this in mind I wanted to explore what other options there are for this? I have seen many options that have just NAS in mind but without docker/LXC/apps or virtualization. 
 I have briefly tried proxmox, but it seems confusing, and I don't see any easy solution for creating containers for running apps. It does seem like UnRAID might be a good choice, but it is closed source and is paid. Not an issue that it's paid, but I disagree with it being closed source.
 ​
 I was hoping to run a couple of VMs for using Windows (Main rig is Linux only and there are some apps that are unfortunately Windows only), and a few game servers, in addition to running jellyfin, vaultwarden, qbittorrent, sftpgo, autobrr, photoprism and maybe a couple of other things should I find anything else interesting.
 ​
 Server has 32GB RAM, AMD 5 2600 CPU, no GPU, 5 8TB Ironwolf NAS drives. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance! Looking forward to seeing what everyone else uses.

 I have a big question that can bee easily spread on a few posts 
 but I think there is a benefit to put it in one post and take the relation between all the part in advance 
 I recently scored a pc with motherboard that can support 8 sata connections and 4 2TB red WD hdd
 And its make me want to rebuild my home lab from the ground up (this time in the right way)
 now I have 
 2 mini pc with AMD Ryzen 3 4300U 8gb ram
 1 regular pc i5-2300 16gb ram
 All 3 PCs with proxmox 
 And now I have another pc with unknow cpu and probably 32gb ram and sapphire old gaming graphics card (this one with the 8 sata connection motherboard ) So I’m thinking about truenas scale
 In my existing home lab I have On lxc containers 
 Trillium, n8n, node red (this is not related to home assistant ), nocodb and
  nginx
 On VM I have 
 home assistant (its very old version and need to be reinstalled ), wireguard and kali linux 
 and one VM dedicated to docker with bookstack, vaultwarden, vikunja and portainer
 I want to add truenas scale, jellyfin, nextcloud
 I have a pc and a streamer connected to my living room tv so I want to able to watch movies with jellyfin with my tv 
 And I want to use nextcloud to replace google services 
 Hopefully that I will find something to replace google keep 
 For now all my lxc and vm are not organized at all and I want to be able to grow and develop my home lab and I feel that now it is the beast time to take a breath and rebuild 
 So can you help me to do it in the the right way

 I'm deciding between hosting an instance of Ubuntu via Docker container on my home server or an instance of VSCode Server. I wouldn't really use the web option included with VSCode Server, so I'm at the very least I'm looking for a place to host all my code to be able to access, edit, and run at any time (which is why a simple Ubuntu instance came to mind). 
 Problem is, would it be better to host either of these on my personal machine which is much more powerful? Either way, what steps would you all recommend for ensuring secure access via SSH from anywhere, if you would even suggest this approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks, this is a bit of an off the wall ask, but I'm trying to find something that is rather light weight & extensible (markdown is really nice) for keeping tabs on ongoing conversations. Essentially, I have a group of friends and we meet regularly (online usually) to discuss a very wide variety of topics. Naturally, this leads to incomplete conversations about topics of interest that we'd like to come back to or address in the future and we're looking for an intuitive way that we could collaboratively do this. Ideally all of us to create/edit/add notes to any given topic so that we can pick it up later and then archive it when we're done. I've contemplated something like a shared todo list or kanban board, but I'm not really sure if either of those is the right fit (the first being too simple, the second being a bit too much). Does anyone have an app that they like for this purpose? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently run a Plex server on my laptop's second HDD, which is used mainly for static storage. Up until now, even if my music is also stored there (I'm also running MusicBee), I've been relying on manual syncs.
 I just managed to setup an Airsonic-Advanced server, as well as installed Substreamer on my phone, but both of those feel really clunky. For instance, I absolutely hate dealing with java.
 I'm looking at the Awesome-Selfhosted list available on the wiki and I can see a lot of other options to accomplish this. Instead of trying them all, I thought I'd rather ask for an informed opinion.
 What's your favorite server-client combo for selfhosted audio streaming on Windows and Android?
 PS: on the server side, I'd like to have a nice UI, but I can deal with CLI if needed!
 PS2: I almost forgot to add: I'm considering buying a lifetime Plex Pass on Black Friday (even then it's not that cheap on Brazil), as I plan to someday expand my little server to outside of this laptop, so Plexamp might be an option!

I really dislike google's service though for a myriad of reasons but the two biggest are that they seem to push their crap app too much and privacy concerns. I have been thinking of switching to Asus because of the price. 
 Does anyone have experience using Asus WebStorage?

 Just after any recommendation or advice at this point please.

 page size (in KB/MB) * expected monthly traffic (in page visits) = TB of necessary traffic
 page size * traffic at any given time determines necessary RAM + Gbps of necessary consistent speed (preferably consistent, not burst, but it's not always clear).
 Obviously amount of stuff you're storing on the server would determine the storage in TB necessary.
 No idea how to determine CPU requirements, and I'm probably missing a lot of other things. 
 Is there some kind of document/flow chart that any of you know of which goes over just how to determine the necessary server specs? It's obviously worth mentioning too that I'd like to leave open the possibility for scale up as necessary, and I'd as…]]></summary>

 Currently, I am utilizing a UDM from Ubiquiti, had a Mikrotik but not really a fan outside of business and enterprise setting. I have noticed that my UDM router keeps randomly resetting and/or just... having weird issues. That and performance side of things are sucking more and more with each update. I will still keep the APs and self-host a cloudkey but, router wise... I want out. lol
 I am going to go probably with pfsense as far as the software goes but, I need to be able to have multiple ethernet ports (More than one for lan).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I'm looking for a selfhosted backup solution for my homelab and I'm hoping y'all can point me in the right direction. I have a number of linux servers that I want to back up and I'm looking for a tool that works in a server-client model - i.e. I can install it on a single server from which I can manage, view and schedule backups, and the server would connect to all the different clients through ssh or an agent or something similar. I've looked at a lot of the commonly recommended backup solutions (kopia, duplicity, duplicati, etc) and they all seem to require installation and configuration per server, so I'd have to set up and install on each server individually.
 Is there anything selfhosted (short of a cronjob + rsync script) that would allow me to backup multiple servers (all linux - mostly debian with a few raspberry pis) that is centrally managed?
 Thanks!

 I am developer of Bloben - selfhosted web client for CalDAV and webcal calendars. Last time I posted here 8 months ago it was pretty bare bone, but now it has some more interesting features.
 Recently was added first support for CalDAV tasks - both in calendar view and in separate tab.
 Other honorable mention is definitely sharing calendars. 
 Hope you find it useful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I hope you can help me with this.
 So I bought a Supermicro-X9SRL-F motherboard (my first Supermicro motherboard (: ) and overall it looks great and works as I would expect it to. I only have two problems and they are with his IPMI.
  
The KVM is only with Java. Is there any update or something that can be done to add an HTML-based KVM to it? Because java doesn't work correctly, when I try to connect to it through the file it downloads to my Mac, it opens and then either crashes straight away or hangs and then crashes. And now I updated the java on my Mac and now it just gives me an error that it can't run this.
 The SSL there only supports TLS 1.0. Is it possible to update it to support at least TLS 1.2? It just seems that OpenSSL needs to be updated there, is there a way to do that?
  
The IPMI version seems to be the most up-to-date - 03.19 
 And the BIOS version is - 3.3
 I would appreciate it if someone has a solution and can help me with this.

 I'm CPU bottlenecked. I need more raw CPU horsepower, or a really really fortunate series of software updates that lets me use GPUs. Software video encoding is CPU bound by nature, and it takes the longest amount of time compared to other steps. Validating the results of the encodes with PSNR and VMAF also take a decent amount of time, which is also entirely CPU bound. The HW encoding queue I have running half the time is also partially CPU bound, although not to the point where it's an issue. Audio processing for the HW encoding queue is also CPU bound.

I’m worried with all the crazy stuff happening with Twitter there might be a mass exodus like what happened with tumblr. I was wondering what was the best way to go about preserving these photos and videos. I was thinking about just brute force screenshots and screen recording but I was wondering if there were any faster methods? 
 I’d like to keep dates and the name of the person who made the art, so I originally planned to take screen shots and upload them in a private discord server, but that would take forever so I’m thinking about just stashing everything on a usb.

 However, the largest backups I can find on archive.org are more around 50 GB: https://archive.org/details/webshots-freeze-frame.
 I downloaded one of the 50GB backups and poked around but it only had about 40,000 photos - much less than the 690 million photos they used to host. (https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/your-internet-photos-are-already-starting-to-die)
 Where's the full backup located and how would one search it? Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I'm trying to optimize my homelab running proxmox 24x7. I mostly have low demanding workload
  
OPNsense
 Domain Contoller (Samba4)
 DNS
 NextCloud (2 users only)
 Some containers (swag, portainer, plex)
 Windows 10 (on-demand, not always turned on)
 Future: 
 In the future I will add other stuff like biwarden, home-assistant, blue iris (or something similar)
 
  
Currently, the CPU usage is around 3-10% (when I don't use the Windows 10 VM).
 The goals are:
  
reducing the power consumption since the energy cost is getting expensive (around 0.59 euro at the moment)
 having a smaller setup
  
My current setup is:
  
CPU: AMD Ryzen 3700x
 Motherboard: Asus Prime x470 PRO
 Case: Fractal Design Define R6
  
I compared different setup, mainly Intel 10th Gen, 12th Gen or just change the motherboard form factor. I read the Intel 11th gen doesn't have a good power consumption.
 1st option:
  
CPU: keep the current Ryzen 3700x
 Motherboard: replace the Asus PRIME x470 PRO with the Asrock B550M-ITX
 Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202
  
2st option:
  
CPU: Intel i5-12400F
 Motherboard: Asrock H610M-ITX
 Chassis: Fractal Design Node 202
  
Option 2 will cost me 200 euro more than option 1.
 I read the Intel 12th allows the IGPU passtrough, which might be interesting for plex/jellyfin.
 ​
 Questions:
  
Does the mini-itx board consume less then mATX/ATX?
 Does the B550 chipset more efficent (less consumption) than x470? I read the x570 consumes 10-15w compared with B550, but I didn't find anyting related to x470 vs B550.
 Does it make sense go for option 2 (intel build) considering the difference price of 200 euro?
  
Power Supply
 Currently I have a Seasonic Focus GX650 (Gold); the node 202 requires to change the PSU with a SFX PSU. Which is best choice between 300W/450W/650W? Would a "bronze psu" a good choice or better stick with a "gold" one?
 ​
 Many thanks to everyone!

 i use the check-sums to check for errors before backing up drives and to check drives every year. thanks for any help.

 Some people say that enterprise drives can't spin down, or they are not meant to be turned off, not optimized for spinning down or going into standby, all softs of stuff like this.
 If I am going to build a video, picture QNAP raid 5. Which I may turn off when not using it and also have my drives spin down when not using the drive as I don't need to access it very often.
 Are using enterprise drives a bad idea and I should avoid them because of them being turned on and off and having to spin down?
 Are consumer drives built to be spun down and are built somehow differently and will last longer or something? 
 I would have thought this would be a non-issue but I'm not sure anymore from reading peoples comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a tool which can encrypt my files along with their metadata for complete privacy.
 The current popular softwares encrypt the file alright but most of them leak some part of the metadata (size, directory structure, modtimes). Veracrypt, Boxcrypt solves this problem by adopting a volume based approach but it's not suitable for cloud storage.
 Some tools I've used:
  
Rclone - By far the most stable but sadly it neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening. By using the crypt remote, the files sizes do change, but it's a static transformer which can be easily deciphered to get plaintext size. By using chunker along with crypt, file sizes could be hidden to some extent, but not completely.
 Cryptomator - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.
 Securefs - Flattens directory structure but does not obfuscate file sizes.
 Gocryptfs - Neither supports file size obfuscation nor directory structure flattening.
 CryFS - Supports both file size obfuscation and directory flattening !! In theory this should be a good fit, but sadly it suffers from terrible performance issues due to the fact that it chunks files into fixed size small blocks (4kb - 32kb). The block size can be configured but it poses some other issues.
  
I've tried all sorts of combinations but it's either unstable or hacky. Looking for any leads here. Thanks !!

So I’m going to move everything to my cooler basement, and while I’ve loved having a “PC desk” (everything displayed under the glass of my desk) I’m finding my needs shifting. I think ideally I should just migrate my PC to my rack to feed my AVR and TV directly, and use an optical DP cable and USB extender/dock to my desk. Any recommendations for a case? Preferably on rails, I have a water cooled RYZEN chip in a full ATX board and an air cooled RTX 3090. Storage is all M.2 and NAS so the footprint is “small.” Although I do have a 10gbps AIC. Thoughts and recommendations?

 The plan is to start small, expand incrementally, as my experience and needs grow, but right now i cant decide if i should start with a NUC+NAS combo or a Tower-server with the storage inside. 
 Usecase in summary:
 Mediastreaming Plex/Jellyfin ( mostly local, 1-2 streams at 1080p max right now )
 Home automation/monitoring - HomeAssistant
 the usual media combo of Sonarr,Radarr, qbittorrent et.c
 various VMs/containers with smaller things to test, PiHole, game-server? github instance? 
 One one hand, it seems i do get alot of nice benefits with getting a used, older tower: 
 Hardware dedicated to running 24/7,
 Xeon CPU/MB combo, ECC, vPro/AMT, iLO, possibly multiple NICs et.c.
 but on the other hand the benefit…]]></summary>

 My dad is trying to upgrade his self hosted media collection with a new machine, however he explicitly wants an LCD/LED display on the front of the case of the machine that displays the currently playing track name/artist
 I've had a look to see if I can find anything which would fit in a PC case but was unable to find anything, he stumbled upon the Logitech Squeezebox and is trying to buy one but I have a feeling it's not going to work as intended.
 Is there any PC cases or anything I can suggest/buy that'd work as a media display for the currently playing track, he wouldn't want to mess around with it so a custom panel isn't an option
 ​
 Any suggestions are welcome, thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I don't know if I'm in the right place with this question, but I'm looking for self-hosted and privacy compliant solutions for a non-profit organisation. Do you have any ideas for applications?
 ​
 We need:
  
an intranet for posting news and sharing messages (e.g. HumHub). External users should have read-only access to specific areas.
 a user database with own attributes per user and a simple user administration for technology beginners (e.g. Keycloak with a simpler user admin UI).
 email boxes that are easy to set up. An admin should simply say what name the mailbox should have and every allowed user (from the identity provider) should then have access via an email client. A ticket system is also welcome.
 a file storage (e.g. Nextcloud).
 a wiki.
 a registration form for events. The price may vary per pre-selection.
  
​
 The requirements are as follows:
  
we have a little more than 1000 members. Each member should have their own account, which in the best case should already exist and must be provided with a password when logging in for the first time. We already have the e-mail addresses and other information in an Excel spreadsheet.
 security: if possible at least password policies and/or two-factor authentication. If the new passkeys feature is already supported, that would be even better. Also, users should be able to be logged out of all services immediately. It should also be possible for our chairperson (over 60) to assign roles to services.
 if an e-mail, name or any other attribute changes in the identity provider, this should also be changed on all other systems as soon as possible.
  
​
 I know C# and web development with PHP well, so I could also write smaller plugins myself. I get along reasonably well with Docker and Linux. The whole thing should run on a rented server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I'm planning on buying a second hand mini pc to turn it into a home server. I surely want to run: vault warden, calibre web, pihole, filerun, jellyfin, syncthing (with a backup drive) and potentially many more services in docker containers. Besides that I was thinking about setting up proxmox to be able to experiment with different linux distros and setups.
 After watching most of the videos from ServeTheHome and doing a little research I found two models that are available from a trustworthy vendor:
 - Dell Optiplex 7060 Micro i7-8700T 6x2.4GHz 8GB
 - Dell Optiplex 3070 Micro i5-9500T 6x2.2GHz 16GB
 They both have the same price (500 in USD). I want to upgrade the RAM to 64gb anyway and get an NVMe SSD. Which one should I pick? I'm more convinced about the 7060 but I still want to hear an opinion of someone more experienced. Which processor will be better for virtualization with proxmox?
 I'm not completely decided on Optiplex either but it just seems like those machines are more solid and tested than lenovo or hp while being slightly cheaper - might be just my incorrect perception though.
 Any advice or comment is appreciated, I'm still learning how to homelab but it's so fun. I'm so happy that a community like this sub exists :D

 Now write is about 6 MB/s. Read changes between 6-40 MB/s but usually on the low end
 Anyone knows why this happened? What should I do to fix this?
  
I ran Disk Drill with its deep search mode to un-delete some files. (There was no disk healthy issue. I just removed the files). 
 
Its file recovery speed was actually fine (60 MB/s) but I copy pasted some files manually. Maybe I shouldn't have done that. 
 
I removed Disk Drill manually because its built-in un-installer didn't work. I can't think of any other reason for this horribly slow transfer speed.
 
Disk has been mostly empty. Disk Drill full depth search found 5TB of files for a 4TB disk. I recovered about 2TB of files to another disk.

 Is there a program I can use to resume transfer if something goes wrong mid upload? I'd hate to have to start over
 With my current, very rough estimates from a small upload speed test I did, it should take about ~30 days. Not sure if it's my wifi or the cloud service that is bottlenecking the speed.
 I've just never moved this much data at once and any advice would be helpful since I'm new to this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I am currently running a Plex media server on my raspberry pi, but it's quite clunky because my media is all sorts of different formats and I'm concerned that streaming high quality movies to my TV (firestick) is not going to work as seamlessly as it does when I simply play the movies from USB storage attached to the TV.
 I am thinking to FTP / SCP my media to the external storage attached to the TV. My question:
  
Can an Amazon FireStick access USB storage attached to the TV? I tried installing ES File Explorer (which supports FTP) but it only sees the FireStick's internal storage.
 
My Samsung TV is UE40H6400 and it seems I can not connect to the Samsung servers, I'm assuming because the TV is out of support. Does anyone know where I can find a list of .apk packages that are supported on this TV? If I can install (for example) ES File Explorer on the TV instead of on the FireStick, I'm assuming that the external storage attached to the TV will appear as accessible.
 
Is there a better way to do this? I just want to avoid having to go through the whole process of connecting my external storage to my PC, moving media to it, disconnecting and reconnecting to TV, playing the media, disconnecting and reconnecting to PC... and so on each time I want to watch something not from a streaming service. I am happy to move stuff over the network ahead of time though.
 
 Thanks for any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I teach game dev. students learning Unity and their projects are saved locally and take 3-5 minutes to load. Currently, this is chaos since sometimes another student is already at the computer their project is saved onto. 
 I've narrowed it down, but still a bit lost on the specifics:
 1) Symlink / Network drive - What drive is worth it, what is overkill? 1TB would be enough for all purposes now, but a 2TB would be ok too. Speed is important(project load times should be as minimally affected as possible), but a bit tough to gauge what is needed. Sata/m.2/nvme? dram? no idea.
 2) NAS - This seems to be more robust, but I'm a small school with about 30 projects(5-10gb average size) and not need insane scaling, just speed. Would a RAID 0 make a big difference? 
 Hard-drive mirroring would be nice, but could upgrade to it later and just do regular backups to start. 
 This is a surprise expense so don't want to spend for something that would be a negligible upgrade, but want to make sure my students get what they need and not cheap out. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading about allocation unit size (AUS) as a factor in drive performance (specifically GPT partitioned NTFS drives on Windows 7/10/11 machines). Some of my drives are almost exclusively large files and so I'm not concerned about the wasted space from (0.5 * AUS) being large.
 Would be curious what your default (not Windows default but your personal one) AUS is for large drives. Does it make a difference in performance/fragmentation/etc?
 Also, I noticed one 20TB drive formatted as 2MB AUS shows up as RAW on a Windows 7 machine I connected it to. I've since confirmed this with another drive and another Windows 7 machine. Thing is, I've not been able to find anything indicating a maximum AUS for Windows 7. I know about th emaximum 2^32 clusters, but large AUS actually decreases the number of clusters. Is there another Windows 7 limit as to the size of such clusters?
 Thanks!

 ​
 I have an e-mail server (With Postfix + Dovecot) in a Raspberry Pi and I would like to have a service to monitor my e-mail server.
 It could be something simple, such us a monitor process which send an e-mail using this e-mail server with the SMTP and then check that the recipients receive the mail. It could be done each 1 hour or something like that.
 I would like to have this kind of monitor because I have had 2 issues in the server (one related to a Postfix update, and other one related to certificates) and I didn't get any alarm... so the issues produced mail delivery failures during some days until I noticed the mail were not working :-(
 Is there any service which could help me? 
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone
 I try to access my DSFile, but I cannot reach it through the Nginx Proxy Manager (NGM).
 Infrastructure:
 Router -> Dream Machine Pro (DMP) -> NPM -> Synology
 What is configured:
 Synology FileStation listens on port 1000 for http and additinally it listens on sub.domain.com.
 Port 1000 and 1001 is forwarded on the DMP towards the Synology, everything else towards the NPM.
 NPM listens on sub.domain.com and forwards that to http://synology:1000, Websockets active.
 NPM uses LE-Cert for sub.domain.com.
 sub.domain.com is configured as cname for customernumber.myhome.bla.bla.bla.isp.com
 What works (at least connectionwise apparently): 
 DSFile App with 'IPv4 of customernumber.myhome.bla.bla.bla.isp.com':1000
 --> Account invalid
 DSFile App with sub.domain.com:1000
 --> Account invalid
 -----> Account is allowed for usage of FileStation!
 What does not work: 
 DSFile App with sub.domain.com
 sub.domain.com with https
 sub.domain.com:1001 with https
 As I would like to secure that connection with https and cannot forward 80/443 to the synology because I need the NPM - which works for every other connection like a webcam-server or a FoundryVTT - to handle that.
 ​
 Does anyone has an idea on how to get my FileStation on the Synology to cooperate with the NPM to get a secure connection?

 I'm not sure if this is really the best place to post this or not, so I apologize in advance if it's inappropriate, but I know this is a body of people who have the same goals and thought processes as I do. I think the end goal is for me to self-host 'something', I'm just not sure what it would be. 
 I work from home, and my wife is a stay at home mother. We have a family calendar via iCloud, and I obviously have a work calendar (I am in lots of meetings) that I can't share with her. 
 I'm trying to find a way for her to schedule personal appointments (where I'd need to watch the baby while she's gone) but make sure it's not done during existing meeting I have at work. 
 Right now I've tried blocking off 2 x 3 hour windows each week, but that's not really feasible as they mostly go unused by her, and I need to be able to schedule calls during them. 
 So I need to find some way to either anonymize my work meetings and upload them to a shared calendar so she can figure out when 'not' to schedule her appointments, or find a way so the appointments she schedules for herself end up on my work calendar. 
 I've got the ability to self host anything I need to to help make this happen, I'm just not sure if such a thing is even possible, let alone what products/technologies I might need to pull it off.

 I just got a new drive for my Storage Spaces, a WD Red. I find it's really loud when I first power up, then calms down, but gets loud randomly during running. It will be really inconvenient to exchange it because I would have to remove it from my Storage Spaces, and I am worried if I did exchange it the new one would be just as loud.

 I have a home server running on freenas that I mainly use with Plex. I got 2x10TB to install in it. Normally I put them in RAID for redundancy and have a sort of backup. But I keep reading that Raid should not be used for backup.
 I get that having a second server with the same amount of space is safer, but in the context of a small home server, I cannot justify the price of buying a second set up. But is there anything else behind the reasoning ?
 I'm trying to figure out if I should still Raid them or just install the 2 separately and have 20TB of storage instead of 10.

 I'm getting my self hosting solution for ebooks set up and I'm using the linuxserver docker images for calibre and calibre-web. One thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether both actually need to be running? I assumed they do as calibre-web states it needs an existing calibre library to get started. For my use case I really just need calibre-web to upload, organise and read ebooks. Not having to run calibre at the same time would be helpful. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello kind friends of r/DataHoarder. 
 I need some help. I am wanting to back up every single picture and video I have across my phone and my family members' phone. They always manage to do something incredibly... wrong for a lack of a better word and lose pictures. Usually saved because it is in the deleted folder but there have been pictures that have been completely wiped. 
 So to tackles this, I was thinking of setting up a NAS Drive but I don't know how much space would be apt. I myself have 110GB worth of pictures. My family members to have more. It's likely to be a home server? I am not sure. 
 I wondered if I could give each family member 1TB of space. But only they can access it with their own password. Nobody can access any drive except their own. Which means if they forget their password to access the drive then... oops, oh well (I am done helping them when they forget their password).
 What would be the best way to get something like this set up?
 EDIT: I suppose I could back up everything to the cloud but many family members don't want me to see their pictures. I am not sure if a cloud service with specific folders for each person where only said person can see files exist. However, I am open to this idea too.

 I have been doing Homelab-ish stuff for about 6-7 years (Started with a Poweredge 2950 and a Raspberry Pi) and honestly I've kinda hit a rut with what i should selfhost. 
 I've been looking through the awesome-selfhosted GitHub and some of the other ones and nothing really appeals to me like something I want to play with and work on. I've done most of the mainstream ones (Grafana, Plex (and the arr services), Wordpress, etc...) but I'm trying to find new ones to play with that I can actually have a use for. 
 The first thing that came to mind when I thought about it was Home Assistant cause I haven't really done anything with that yet, but I don't exactly have any devices that would connect up to HA (or if I do, I don't really use them or don't know about them). 
 Another thing I wanted to try doing was get a Grafana set up with Power Draw, but realized quick I would need special hardware that I don't really have the time nor money to get. 
 Please help me get out of this rut if you have any ideas. 
 Thanks

 so let just say that minipc is running a LOT of stuff, cpu wise it's ok ram usage, it's always at 75% minimum usage
 i'm starting to worry that I might need to get something a little bit "better" before I run out of ram or cpu, what do you think I should do?
 if changing it is the consensus, budget would be 200-300$ and must have 2 ethernet (i'm using a dedicated one for the unifi app to be under a specific vlan) and low power (under 20-25 watt)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a few months ago I finally got enough drives to fill up my server (Dell T630) and have a sizable amount of storage (3x 6 drive Z2's of 8TB SAS drives, 32TB RAW x 3). I'm currently using a Ubuntu 22.04.x VM with ZoL with the PERC H730 passed through.
 To get a single share I'm currently using mergerFS to combine my pools + gdrive. Biggest issue is that mergerFS as far as I've seen just prioritizes the first "drive", fills that up and them moves to the next drive without any kind of distribution. That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.
 The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now. Is glusterfs a good option to get that single point of storage and share or are there better options now?

 I have checked the awesome-self-hosted list several times, and have been searching online for months and I haven't found anything that hits the mark. 
 Required:
  
Multi-User
 Collaboration, doesn't need to be realtime, but the ability to have notes that can be edited by multiple users.
 Tags or some other reasonable way to organize.
 full featured WYSIWYG editor. I love MD as a format, but I don't want to have to use it to make a shopping list. Plus none of the people I share notes with are "techsavvy" so I need something "anyone" could pickup and use. 
 Embed at-least Images & PDF files. 
 iOS apps, or at-least a mobile friendly WebUI. 
  
Preferred:
  
Highlight and markup PDFs and Images. (Synology can't do this)
 Drawing & Handwriting. (Synology can't do this)
 WebClipper extension for browsers. (preferably Firefox)
 Backlinks (Synology can't do this)
 Some way to create groups of notes from different notebooks (Smart Collections is what Synology calls this.)
  
I have searched high and low and can't find anything that checks all the boxes for me. I was actually surprised by this as most of this is stuff Evernote was doing over a decade ago.

I love it, but I don’t like that I don’t have control of the sync service that the app uses. I’d like to find an app(s) that have iOS and desktop (or web) clients that can sync with a self-hosted service like Nextcloud/WebDAV/CalDAV/some other self hosted service.
 I’ve done some research but I can’t seem to find anything that fits my needs. I installed Nextcloud Tasks on my Nextcloud instance, but the web client doesn’t really work on mobile. I found an app called 2do. It looks like it would be a good fit, but the CalDAV sync with Nextcloud doesn’t really work. 
 Does anyone know of any apps/services that fit that description that provide a good UX? Thank you!

 I've been working on setting up a password management service that acts as a secure storage for passwords that allows user based access restriction and is accessible via web browser on computers that are shared by employees. Basically a page that people can login to an see whatever passwords they've been given access to.
 I've been trying out Passbolt using docker and have everything running correctly but I now realise that this is probably not the right thing for my needs as you can't actually switch between users on a shared computer. 
 Is there a similar password manager that allows this?

 --------------------------
 Finally today is the day. I always wanted to have my own NAS for homelab on a budget. So stared to source hardware few months ago.
 I managed to snag a used Dell Optiplex 9010 for C$25 and just today I got new 4x 4TB HDD for C$240 from marketplace.
 Below are the specs:
  
Dell Optiplex 9010
 Core i3-3220 @ 3.30GHz
 8GB DDR3 Ram
 500GB WD enterprise SATA HDD
 Samsung 128GB SATA SSD
  
Sealed pack 4x 4TB Seagate EXOS 7E8 SATA HDD. DOM: 23JUL2021
 In addition I have the below USB 3.0 Hard Drives:
  
5TB Seagate Expansion USB drive
 4TB Seagate Backup Plus Portable USB drive
 2TB Samsung M3 portable usb drive
 1TB Seagate Backup portable USB drive
 1TB WD my passport usb drive
  
From my current PC I have the following hard drives that I can include:
  
 HUA722020ALA330 Hitachi 2-TB 7.2K 3.5 3G 64MB SATA
 Samsung 1 TB Spinpoint 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 3.5 inch Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive HD103SI
  
​
 What is the best strategy/setup you would recommend for this NAS build. How many storage pool? what RAID mode? etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: I meant I’ll this computer that uses an AC Adapter work with the specified UPS? I didn’t mean a DC cable literally.
 I'm embarrassed. I feel like I should know this, but as soon as numbers come into play, my eyes glaze over.
 Computer (Intel NUC5i5RYK) :
  
DC Input Voltage Supported: 12-19 VDC
 TDP: 15 W
  
UPS Backup Battery (APC UPS 600VA BE600M1)
  
Input Voltage: 120 Volts (120 VAC)
 600VA / 330W battery power
  
Does it sound like the UPS can support the computer and vice versa? I tried a UPS for this computer in the past and when I switched to battery mode, it didn't fully turn on and wouldn't for a couple weeks. I replaced the CMOS battery, and it worked again. I'm not sure if that's a BIOS setting or if it was truly not compatible, but I'm hoping it was just a coincidence.
 If that won't work, would something like this CyberPower EC850LCD work?
 I just want the Intel NUC to work on both battery and while plugged in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody!
 I'm new with Drone and I'm trying to figure out how it works.
 Their documentation seems to be a little poor or outdated.
 First I setup the secret called "secret_name" in the Secret Drone section in a repo called "test-repo". 
 Then I commit the "test-repo" with this .drone.yml file in it:
 --- kind: pipeline type: docker name: Drone YAML CI testing steps: - name: test_drone_docker image: alpine:3.9 commands: - echo "show hello world by drone" - echo $(pwd) - echo -e ${user} settings: user: from_secret: secret_name 
 And the result is the following:
 latest: Pulling from library/alpine Digest: sha256:bc41182b7ef5ffc53a40b044e762933bc10142b1243f395ee852a8c9730fc2ad Status: Image is up to date for alpine:latest + echo "show hello world by drone" show hello world by drone + echo $(pwd) /drone/src + echo -e 
 What am I doing wrong or miss?
  
EXTRA: 
 I've Drone integrated to my Gitea instance and sometimes after a change, Drone CI never starts. It's like don't see some commits.
 For example:
 git commit -m "Change readme.md"
 git push
 Task #1 runs ok
 git commit -m "Add a line to readme.md"
 git push
 Here the task #2 should run, but nothing happens. Any idea? (This is a random behavior. Maybe run maybe not. No matter the run number)
 It's Drone a little buggy or I just am I using it in a wrong way?
 Thanks!
  
Drone image docker version: drone/drone:2
 Drone runner version: drone-runner-docker:1
 Gitea version: gitea/gitea:1.17.3 I've drone installed with Gitea

 I wanted to share some videos with a few friends. I find youtube's scanning of my videos (AI subtitle generation, voice recognition/model training, etc) all just plain creepy. I didn't want anything as complicated as Plex or Jellyfish (Jellyfin? Jelly somthin). My initial plan was to just use the HTML <video> tag, but that ends up downloading the entire file before playback, which doesn't really work when the videos I want to share are 30+GB. (It's gopro footage I take, chill)
 For later - input_files

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come to the realization that I have way too much stuff to keep track of in my head. I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.
 I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.
 If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:
 *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.
 I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.
 Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.

 I tried to follow this guide: https://www.aware-online.com/en/how-to-save-an-instagram-video/
 However, the media tab didn't show anything, and when I tried to look up .mp4 I just get kept getting "fetch" stuff that would appear blank: https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/53613266_356782574924247_4045776294154163764_n.mp4?_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=NAqFbUI5vvUAX9LWniM&edm=ALQROFkBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCuNfuect8TPjYKb-59InaIVdDGL_QymtMdr_i3YJc1iQ&oe=63603ACB&_nc_sid=30a2ef&bytestart=182736&byteend=265046
 I then realized it might be a browser issue, so I go to Chrome, open developer tools, and open something in a new tab and get the full 1 minute video. https://scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/273191872_465066081956232_1477049072325599577_n.mp4?efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjQ4MC5jYXJvdXNlbF9pdGVtLmRlZmF1bHQiLCJxZV9ncm91cHMiOiJbXCJpZ193ZWJfZGVsaXZlcnlfdnRzX290ZlwiXSJ9&_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=100&_nc_ohc=cGitUXKg-VEAX_QKGnD&edm=AP_V10EBAAAA&vs=18154210978212948_962453701&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdNQ1RTQkNJc1p5aV9hWUJBRm1oeVRkT2lIOFVia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHQjFXUnhDcXRKRWRvbVlDQURVT1llS190SmNaYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwAVAAAm8sbZmIb%2Bwz8VAigCQzMsF0BOBDlYEGJOGBJkYXNoX2Jhc2VsaW5lXzFfdjERAHXuBwA%3D&_nc_rid=2da3fd2460&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfDxfq8Mc6mN3S5F1kW4oBdjoOyL3c3c7N_9c1M7g4zjvA&oe=63603660&_nc_sid=4f375e

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got my hands on ICX6450-24P switch. I know these are very popular among home-labbers so figured I'd check in with you crazies. I'd like to get the stock fans modified. There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.
 I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. 
 It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.
 Questions:
  
What are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?
 How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. 
 Is there any fan out there that will not show the "Fan Failed" message in the console? My main concern is I just want to be able to monitor if the fans actually do fail.
  
Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to name my photos and videos in the yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss format so that when I sort them by name, all the photos and videos of a particular event show in the order they were shot in, not to mention that memories shot by different people of the same event shows in an integrated manner.
 I have used XNView for years on Windows. I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.
 Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.
 Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).
 Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.
 I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.
 Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?

To be clear there is no psu/mobo in this case. 
 I'm having a hell of a time searching for one, if such at thing exists. If I can't find anything I'll just drill holes into the side of the case and use zip ties / velcro to make my own.
 I figured others who build NAS might have run into this solution / problem before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a single host (10.1.10.10) running 20+ docker containers. One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). 
 Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The "internal" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). 
 Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. 
 My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. 
 Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes. Any ideas? 
 Thanks for the help.

 So I'm currently planning to build (or buy) my first PC, which will be used as a server.
 I will use this server for many purposes, including : - Hosting small game servers (Minecraft) - Mysql DB - VPN & other stuff While everything will be running on Docker.
 So I've digged a bit in the subject and I like the compact size of the Mini-ITX, but I'm afraid some parts won't be upgradeable and I don't know if the cooling will be efficient enough, especially when running game servers. As for the CPU, I've seen the Ryzen 5700u, but I got no idea if it works the same way as a desktop cpu. As for the Mini-ITX, this form factor tends to be bigger in size ( but very flexible to transport). I also don't know a lot of headless cases.
 So I would like to have your advice and some build/pc recommendations. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got 12 external USB drives varying in size from 1tb to 4tb. 
 I've got a small mini PC with only 2 available usb ports. 
 What I'd like to do is find a way to plug all of these into the mini PC so i can sort of index and search for files and start purging (I know...). This will help me whittle down what I need to move to the NAS once I am able to upgrade all the drives.
 Is there a suggestion related to USB hubs that will do this and maybe some software? I run Linux only, so any suggestions are sincerely welcome :-)
 I do have a NAS which is full at the moment (ds920+ with 4x4tb drives which is due for an upgrade when I can afford it). But for now I'm looking for a reasonable solution to be able to access data in one place from these externals.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few minutes ago i discovered some strange network devices that must have been in my network a few days ago. i saw them when updating my pihole and then i looked up their client history in the unifi dashboard. there are two devices with vendor ids from "Universal Access Technology, Inc." and "Youth Keep Enterprise Co Ltd". I've never heard anything about those and googling them doesn't yield any fruit. one has been in the guest wifi about a month ago for 6 minutes, the other three days ago for about 3 minutes. what could that possibly be? ever heard of either one of those two? (nothing was compromised or anything, just wondering what that might be?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to get a bit more serious into film and video editing, so I've been starting to do a bit more shooting in formats such as Blackmagic RAW. I'd like to archive my projects (in full) when I'm done with them. These things can get quite chonky, so I don't want to leave them sitting on my laptops.
 What is a cost effective method I could use for these backups? I don't mind getting a slower spinny HDD over an SDD (as I won't edit off of these).
 I'm not looking for some massive RAID setup or a backup server. Only an external drive (and possibly a second one for redundancy). I do know how to work with computer hardware and whatnot, so putting an internal drive in some sort of housing, if that's cheaper, is no problem for me.

 My compose file:

 What I don't understand is why qBittorrent is able to create the incomplete download file in "/Downloads/Incomplete" but it's still giving the "Errored" message. If it has read/write access then shouldn't it be working?
 How do I fix this?

 The idea is to have an attached USB drive accesible for some friends and I in which we can share some folders and have another private ones for each other. Something like a Google Drive type of service. It isn't necessary to mount the drive on windows although it would be nice too. A simple web UI accessible from my internet domain is all I need.
 I've read about Open media vault but never used it, it seems that it focuses on files only on the same network, It would be nice to know if it fits the purpose.
 Any suggestion is appreciated.

 I am currently in the process of planing my new Nas that should solve my storage problems for the next couple years and give me plenty expansion option.
 My goal is to have 36 sas hdds connected to my server without a bottleneck with the least amount of pcle 4.0 x16 slots. The max amount i found where some lsi cards with 24 ports and they where quite expensive.
 I also read about expanders but how negative is the effect on the performance?
 From what i understand you could for example split a single 6g connection to two 3g ones, which should still be fine for hdds, right?
 Would it work to get one of the 24 ports with an expander and then use (theoretically) 48 disks at 3g each, without a performance hit when all disks are written to at the same time?
 Thx :)

Github shows a lot of activity, would love to see it grow. It has some great videos on youtube showing you how to use it. However they're about 4 years old, they don't always match the interface but the majority of them are accurate enough to show you how to build an internal app. I'm not affiliated with the project. 
 Install is easy enough, extract to a folder nginx or apache can server, edit the sample config to match your environment and open it in a browser. Fairly simple. 
 If there's another project similar to this I'd love to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had an interest in revisiting some old iOS apps I used to play as a kid so I've been looking into where I can download some of the delisted ones. I've noticed though that archive.org seems to be having trouble keeping IPA files available for download, or at least I assume so.
 For example, one of my favorite iOS games, Gesundheit! by Matt Hammill, has been delisted for a few years now. I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).
 Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.

However, I can't really afford to do both of those, the computer I have priced out is around 2k and about 500-1k for the server. How possible would it be to combine the two and run a VM as my workstation? I plan to do a bit of gaming and remote work as a IT tech when I work from home. Gameplanning this, I want two GPU's one for passthrough for gaming and one for anything else I need on my server, like hardware decoding. I tried looking online for this and maybe my search terms were bad, but I really couldn't find anything. Thoughts?

 So I searching for self hosted mailserver solution. I know many people say "don't do it" but I convinced to do it anyway. (So plz don't comment "use hosting" etc ;) ) 
 So I've seen many options on internet (like mailu, mailcow, docker-mailserver or mail-in-a-box) but don't any recent reviews/comparisons. So I come to ask you guys ;)
 My requirements/plan:
 - I plan to limit ramusage of mailserver to ~2GB RAM max
 - Work with Nginx Proxy Manager with no bigger issues (I know I need to bind certs to mailserver container too)
 - I will use webmail, if not included, probably roundcube or nextcloud-client
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 i'd like to setup a UPS to ensure my homelab can safely shut down during a power outage. I have purchased a Powerwalker VI 600 STL. It has an USB-HID connector on the back which is currently connected to my Synology DS216. I set up the UPS via DSM and it seems to be working fine. But now i'd like to connect also my Proxox server. As it seems i have the following options
 Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud
 I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.
 I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my "server".
 What do you think? Where should I connect my UPS (proxmox host or Synology)? Which software should i use?

 But the big thing that isn't mandatory but would be really really nice is if it supports some way for me to tie it into Patreon, so my patrons can have their comments be highlighted or some kind of "built in" perk for being a Patron, with respect to their comments.
 Even something as simple as a little "Patron" badge on their comment or whatever, its not necessary but would be absolutely wonderful.
 Anyone know if such a thing exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have an extensive movie / tv, documentary collection. I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.
 I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.
 I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:
  
Media Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.
 An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.
 If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.
 Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)
  
It does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.
 Thanks!

 I am slowly getting started just trying things out and not committed to any particular applications. I know there are porn specific tools. I am asking more how to plan things out and maybe there are some techical aspects I need to learn up on.
 How do you manage access to keep it discreet? What if I wanted to use the same service for both kinds of content? Is it possible to run 2 instances of a server on a single machine and have them not get mixed up? Seperate domains?
 Same question about media gathering tools like torrents, ytdlp, wget etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm usually not one to ask questions, but I'm at a loss for this. I figured if there was anywhere that could help me with large storage servers, it'd be r/datahoarders
 I recently had a bad electrical experience which knocked out my storage server. ( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. 
 My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array. (none of the drives in question were from the original failure) I am at a complete loss at what kind of formatting and partitioning these drives were set up with. The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.
 First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.
  
Macroit says they're each just one large logical partition
 AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions
 Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.
  
When I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.
 I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.
 I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, stupid question ahead:
 I have a rack with two r710s, a r720, a couple homebrew servers and 7 laptops all doing different stuff. I have a 48 port switch and 12 port POE switch. 
 I can't run cable where I moved to cause it's a rental.
 If you had a rack of servers and couldn't run cable, what wireless option would you choose and how would you set it up? Need to set up certain devices in a separate VLAN also. 
 I suck at networking and I'm just looking for suggestions so I have a starting point. Most budget friendly options are preferred but if something a little more expensive is worth the cost I'm open minded.
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I am in the process of helping my friend set up his very first home server - A Dell R510 12 bay. It doesn't have a RAID controller, and from what I've seen, the H200 (flashed to IT mode) seems like a good choice for doing software raid. My friend will be running either Proxmox or unRAID. 
 I have a couple questions before purchasing this card
  
 What is the max number of drives supported by 1 H200 card? I’ve read that it’s 256 drives but I’d like to double confirm with y’all.
 
 Is there any limitation max drive capacity per HDD? I don’t think so but again, looking for this community’s help.
  General question - how is the H200 different from something like an LSI 9211-8i since that card breaks out one SFF-8087 into only 4 SATA drives? here's an example

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 On the beginning I will start with "Don't try this at home" :) I've see a lot of questions on redit and truenas forum about using non ecc ram, hdd over USB and stripe pool. That's why I was start to testing all the "not to do" stuff. At home I've found an old Dell latitude laptop with i5 and 12 GB ram (extra I add an PWM fan with Ntc sensor for better cooling) , some caddy adapters and now I buy 2 powered USB hub. The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... 
 Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. 
 Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) 
 Just home lab for fun

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new solution.
 Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.
 So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.
 Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.
 Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.

 It will recognize a face from a photo, you tell it who that face belongs to, then for all of the examples it has of that person, it'll try to recommend more photos who it thinks are the same person. It gets more and more confident the more examples it has, and you can customize the level of confidence required for it to "guess" about a person's identity if the matches you're getting aren't good enough or something.
 It works great, for photos at least, and it runs locally on my PC and is accessible via the mobile app if I'm on the same network. However, it's not free past a certain point, and the tagging tools and certain other parts of the desktop and mobile apps leave a lot to be desired.
 Does anyone know of a similar application/system/script I can run in order to do the same thing?

While trying to set up a mail server, I found that they block port 25, while my home ISP does not. In an attempt to get around the restriction at Oracle, I am now trying to host my mail server on a spare computer at home. Is this wise, and would it be possible to hide my home ip in doing so (with say a vpn or proxy through Oracle)?

 I've got some software running in an Ubuntu VM server. It seems to work fine, as I can access it's webUI via HTTP on the local network without issue.
 However, when I try to set up an nginx reverse-proxy subdomain configuration for this, it prompts me with an error about "contradictory scheme headers" ( only when accessed via subdomain.mydomain.com ), and I can't seem to find much more information in either of the NGINX logs or the VM NGINX logs.
 My assumption is that Cloudflare's enforcement of HTTPS and that this VM server is running on HTTP is causing this error.
 The VM server has an NGINX configuration of its own, which is it was when installed. This software suite seems particularly fragile so I haven't been to eager to mess with these settings:

 First I would connect all the SATA drives to this SATA-to-M2 board:

 I have a new box ready to go: Dell Optiplex i5 8GB RAM and a blank 256GB SSD. I plan to use Ubuntu as the Host OS.
 I want to run:
  
Wireguard
 Nextcloud
 Matrix
 Jitsi
 PHP app + MySQL (hypothetical)
  
I previously set up a box with Proxmox, which was cool and all, but I don't want separate VMs. It's a pain to have X separate IPs for X hosts and manage/maintain all X VM OSes. I need a low-key humble homelab! Besides, I want to run something that is more commonly used in SMB/EDU prod.
 How would you decide whether to run these apps on the host OS, in a VM, an LXC, or a Docker container? What factors do you consider?
 NOTE: I want to learn popular tools and methods that could help me advance my SysAdmin career. In our small, private, low-budget K12 env, we use Hyper-V, so I know the basics of that. But I want to self-host more FOSS to save us money and not feed the beasts (M$, Oracle, Cisco, etc.).
 P.S. I did my DD and read all the Reddit posts that I could find on the topic. Here, I'm looking for some specific factors to use for current and future analysis.

 This is a test scenario, as I want to see what I can get away with. The primary disk I'm attempting a backup of consists of various random files dumped onto an SMB share, which then gets backed up to another HDD (not shared by SMB). I know that these drives can sustain a 90MB/s throughput by doing a simple copy & transfer. 
 However, as pictured below, when trying to backup HDD #1 to HDD #2, we're averaging around 50-100mbit/s with an expected E…]]></summary>

 I also still have to mount the cd or the iso on the system for most to play properly. 
 I’ve seen some of the games I struggle with work flawlessly on the internet archive in the web browser and I would like to use something like emulatorjs to accomplish this. 
 If people have resources they know of I’d appreciate some solid reference material. Evening I’ve found that is kind of related is pretty old. 
 I did at one point have a dosbox environment setup with lots of these games installed inside, but that would be difficult for kids to navigate so replicating the ease of IA web browser play would be ideal.

 With my self hosted environments I am often booting in to gparted or clonezilla to repartition or back up.
 I also use these tools on friends and familys machines before working on them.
 Grml-rescue boot automates adding iso files to your boot partition and updating grub.
 In my case it was apt-get install grml-rescueboot, copying iso files to /boot/grml and running update-grub each time I add an iso.
 So awesome. Much better than a usb key in many instances. Especially if you can get them to boot in to ram which this seems to support with
 echo 'CUSTOM_BOOTOPTIONS="toram"' >> /etc/default/grml-rescueboot Then running Update-grub

 Hi,
 so I'll be taking my first steps in the selfhosting journey with an ODROID HC4 DIY NAS running open media vault. What I'd like to know whether there is a tool that I can install on the device that would let me download files from an sftp server through a web-interface. I'd like to skip a step in having the file transfer directly from the server to the NAS instead of booting up the PC to manage the transfer process with filezilla. Basically something like filezilla but running on the NAS that has a webinterface to start transfers. Any ideas are welcome.
 Thanks!

 I recently started messing around with an older laptop as a home server, running Fedora Server. Got some services like Jellyfin, Pi-hole, Heimdall and Nextcloud running in Docker containers via Portainer. In the future I might set up remote access via Wireguard. I want to make sure everything is only accessible via my local network for now, though, as I don't feel comfortable exposing my server to the internet yet
 I have port forwarding and UPnP disabled on my router, and always make sure that my OS and apps are up to date. I believe this is enough to ensure that my server and the running services can only be reached via LAN. Is this enough, or should I take extra precautions? I do have things like SSH and compass allowed in firewalld, as well as the required ports for my Pi-hole, Jellyfin instance, etc. Is that okay?

 Figured I'd post my RMA experience here since I'm sure there are a lot of Samsung SSD owners here, may save you some time if you need to RMA one of their drives.
 One day my OS crashed while trying to acess a file and upon rebooting, the boot drive (870 EVO 1TB) was reporting SMART read errors, and it seemingly couldn't reallocate the sectors properly. Googling around, it seems like this is some kind of recurring quality issue with these drives that Samsung refuses to acknowledge. My drive was only a year old with ~35TB written so well within the warranty. Kind of unfortunate since Samsung always seems to be heralded as the king of reliability in the SSD market.

 I want to move the second set of backups drives offsite, but I've realized I don't really have anywhere to take them. At first, I thought I'd just pay for a bank box and store them there, but then I realized most bank locations don't offer personal safety boxes anymore.

I was wondering if, instead of removing the pin on the drive itself, I could attach my drive (in this case a WD100EMAZ) to a female sata to male sata extension and remove the pin on that. I know there’s guides everywhere on how to do this, but I worry about ruining the surrounding pins and subsequently the drive and my data when trying to remove the pin, molex to sata is bad for your data, and the kapton tape solution just makes me nervous about getting pieces of tape stuck where they shouldn’t be. Could this solution work, or is there a less invasive way to make this work? Thanks in advance.

I am about to give up and maybe create my own, but before doing that I want to ask here. My requirements are:
  
Free for personal use
 Data is hosted on a server, and NOT an app using local data file like Obsidian.
 Desktop/mobile web UI, NOT needing a special client app like Turtl, Joplin, Obsidian, etc.
 Ability to paste or attach images
 Dark mode
 Full text search, not just title/tag search
  
I tried to use Trilium, but the UI is too complex and slow. Isn't there something simple and fast? Other than occasional images, the total size of textual notes would not grow more than a few MB's (1~3KB per note * 1000 notes), so it really doesn't need to be complex requiring a heavy-duty database like Postgres, like some of the note-taking apps I have tried..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought an old PC off eBay to use in a retro setup from a seller that recycles loads of stuff that people and organisations have thrown away. The seller claimed the 40Gb IDE hard drive had been fully formatted. When in actual fact it still contained the Windows XP OS from 2012 used by a city council office complete with wedding photos and home maintenance invoices containing the home address of the council worker who used the computer.
 Just shows what little concern most people have about their private data.

I've done some learning about things like cloud-init, terraform, packer, and preseeding; but something just isn't clicking for me. It seems like there is a lot of feature overlap and i'm having trouble understanding the philosophy of use for each. I was hoping to get some discussion going. Do you use any of these or other programs? What roles if any do they fit in your homelab/how do you use them in conjunction with each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I currently run a business on my gaming PC, but currently, the motherboard and its components are just sitting out on some cardboard. The case was delayed and I just wanted to use the PC, so I went without but now it seems way too cumbersome to strip the motherboard and install it in the case. But I feel that one day, I will sneeze or something and I'll break it. I currently turn it on by using a screwdriver to short the two prongs.
 Anyway, the way things work is that the PC runs a few data-heavy python scripts, then sends the data to another database which then is displayed on my site. 
 I want to have the python code and the necessary files on a remote VM that is hosted by another company. I want to be able to access it from anywhere if I have to debug on-the-fly or if my PC eventually breaks. 
 I would like to use a vmware horizon solution, but I've been navigating the site for over 30 mins now and can't just find a straight-up price / download. This effort to obscure the price makes me think that whatever the price is, it's too high. 
 So, what is a low-cost and easy-to-setup windows VM that I can access remotely? It has to be hosted on a network that isn't my own.
 Thank you

 I've got a Dell PowerEdge R520 and something from SuperMicro, and the fans are so loud that I end up turning off my machines after a few days to get some quiet.
 I've tried unplugging the fans, but I get worried about heat dissipation. Don't want to cook my machines.
 Does anyone have any tips for me?

 I have a tons of videos i want to convert from h264 (i think they'r mostly h264) to h265.
 I have few questions if possible:
 1- Is it true that the 264->265 conversion has no quality loss?
 2- How long it usually takes to convert a video? Lets say 90 minutes of a 720 H264 to H265 with 32gb ram and I5-6400 cpu?
 3- Anyone know a good free software to do it that is not too complicated? 
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am wanting to self-host a DNS server on my home network so that I can spin up some internal apps. This is my first go at this so sorry in advance if this question is trivial. 
 I’ve updated my router to point to my local DNS server address and rebooted the router. The router appears to have successfully updated the address but when I go to Network -> Advanced -> DNS on my Mac, it still points to Comcast’s DNS server. I would expect the DNS address update to automatically propagate to my device’s network configuration. I’ve tried rebooting and re-adding the Wi-Fi network. Any one know why this could be the case or a possible resolution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I find it difficult, like many others do, to set up all the subsystems and configurations in a unraid server. I have all the time in the world but I think my willpower to push further is waning. YouTube videos are great until it doesn't %100 apply to the situation. I rtfm, I've set up a boat load of dockers which work great. What is left to do is all the security (https, TLS/SSL), a public HTTP server, public ftp server, wireguard, nginx, Plex, docker network, proper cache settings.
 I'm totally capable of doing all that but it's just turning into such a time sink that I want to do other things instead. I'm not interested in spending weeks understanding how to get a SSL certificate for my domain installed, even though that's how it goes. Has anyone here had experience with hiring someone to do all that work under contract? Such a crazy proposition considering they'd have complete and total access to all personal data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting married next year, and we're starting to try to figure out how we're going to handle things like RSVPs and gift registries. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations, preferably for self-hosted tools?
 Specifically what I am looking for so far (doesn't have to be in one app):
  
Good RSVP system - like Zola or WithJoy. We want to restrict rsvps to people who we invite, so ideally I want to be able to have a personalized link for each guest that we'll add to their invite along with a qr code. Something where they go to their link and it already has their information filled out and only need to answer a couple questions.
 Gift registry - I'm leaning towards just linking to something like Zola's gift registry or individual gift registries at different stores, but it would be nice to have one place where they are synchronized.
 Gift tracker? Not sure what to call it, but something to keep track of who gave us what so that we can send out thank-yous
 Simple website to display travel instructions, FAQs, etc
 Photo Uploader - An app or website where guests can upload photos to a shared folder that we can access. I might set up another instance of nextcloud with anonymous uploads just for this, unless there is something better?
 Photo Gallery - For after the wedding if we want to share photos.
 
Contacts updater - For people who we don't have contact info for, we'd send them a link to some sort of form for them to provide their mailing address. Worst case we can probably use google forms for this.
  
I have a few ideas for some of these things, but would appreciate any ideas everyone has! We've also been looking at something like squarespace or self-hosting wordpress/ghost. All of the generic "wedding website builder" offerings don't offer much customizability, but we also definitely want to at least use some sort of template and not do everything from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a noob when it comes to ZFS.
 I went overboard with my homelab setup with 2x 16 drive storage arrays and a 12 bay server and setup a RaidZ3 pool with 3 vdevs, 1 for each piece of hardware (2x16drives,1x12drives), all 3TB SAS drives.
 I'm realizing I don't need this much storage at this very moment but already copied over my existing data and downloaded some new stuff too. 
 Is there any option for me to shrink the pool? Or do I have to transfer the data off and create a new pool?
 I'm also assuming if I start with a 12 drive pool raidz3 (which will be enough for the moment), I can add more vdevs to the raidz3 pool later when I fill it and need more space? Am I correct on that? 
 Just want to save on my electric bill for now rather than pay for unused space. 
 Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, long timer lurker first time poster.
 I'm looking for a self hosted alternative to Cloudflare's Zero Trust / Access.
 For those who aren't super familiar with it, CF Zero Access is nice because the user has to authenticate through CF to the SSO before they're even able to get to the proxied web application. This is nifty because it protects crappy PHP web applications against unauthenticated attacks since no traffic is allowed to the application until the user is authenticated.
 I've done my research but most of the solutions I've found (Authelia, Authentik, etc) only seem to support proxying underlying web application when using HTTP Basic authentication. As soon as you're talking about using OAuth2 or something else modern the flow always seems to revert to going to the web application and then clicking the login button. This opens them up to unauthenticated attacks again.
 Am I missing something obvious or does anyone have any ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm trying to preserve some videos of a youtube channel and the app I'm using lets me either download them in a .webm format as is or convert to mp4 H.264 which is the same size but there's very noticeable artifacts and lower quality of the video.
 I did test another converter which lets me do mp4 H.264 and this one is the same quality as the webm but it's a 6 times larger file.
 My question is if the webm format will be a problem in the future (compatibility wise)? I would rather keep it standard to mp4 but I don't like the larger file sizes. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a jam-band lover on my holiday gift-giving list, and I'm thinking of doing a substantial download (~4TB) from bt.etree.org over the next couple months, and giving it to him on some easy-to-use device. The simplest would just be HDD, but I don't think he actually has any type of local media server (like not even iTunes on a PC). So, my question is:
 Is there something like a vendor NAS OS that would:
  
Provide an SMB service so he can connect the music to Sonos
 Possibly host Jellyfin/Plex/ other audio-specific media server
 Give him access to a BT client so he can continue to grow his library
 Keep itself reasonable up-to-date and secure
  
I'm familiar with a DIY solution, but this needs to be more of an appliance than a hobby unto itself. Part of the gift would be opening the door to the contemporary bittorrent version of the 'taper/trader' jam band scene.
 Any tips would be awesome, thanks!

 It needs to be managed; at the very least VLANs must be supported and 802.1X.
 I also want to feed some access points and cameras via PoE so it must also be PoE.
 In terms of ports 16 might do it but 24 would be a good number.
  
Mikrotik does not seem to have proper PoE out switches (except the one for 1000 bucks)
 TP Link TL-SG2424P is slightly more (~300$) than I was hoping for
 GS1900-24HPV2 for is also ~300$
  
Is there anything else I should consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm upgrading my NAS setup to a 12TB RAID1, and have bought two Ultrastar DC HC520. I bought one new and another one used from Amazon Warehouse, especially trying to avoid them being manufactured on the same batch.
 However, both were manufactured the same day in 2021. The "used" disk had 120h of prior usage according to SMART. Should I return one and try to buy another one at a different online store, or is this no longer a risk?
 I have searched a lot and there seems to be some correlation, but usually USENIX and other papers I've read on the matter usually talk about huge disk arrays... how about a simple 2-bay RAID-1 setup? Should I take the extra precaution?

 I think it's a great machine, with i5-4570T 2.9GHz, 8GB of RAM and 500 GB SSD and it has a very low power consumption, but it lacks a good way to get a lot of storage connected, so I am wondering what would be a good way to set up storage and connect it to this tiny pc?
 I am thinking about picking up 3-4 WD Red 4TB drives and maybe putting them in an external enclosure of some sort, but I wanted to try and avoid connecting them via USB because of performance loss.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 Recently I've been wondering how people bootstrap their lab environments. At work we have a lab that was setup before I started and they manually install vsphere/k8s(rancher) with out of tree management. This allows for spinning up VMs to be used as part of the cluster from rancher.
 However I noticed that rancher is spun up in a k8s cluster that is formed insider a docker container.
 IE docker-run->k8s cluster generated->rancher installed. This is a one liner from rancher for development testing. Then we have downstream clusters spun up inside vsphere via ranchers GUI.
 The reason for all this is "Cloud Agnostic", so we're not using a managed k8s service AKS/EKS etc.
 Anyway I was setting up a new home lab before I had an old r710 server with proxmox and did a lot of manual configuration, vm creation not fun.
 My new setup is 3 dell thin clients with proxmox all joined to a DC. Now aside from manually installing proxmox which I could've automated with PXE boot *I plan on testing PXE boot deploys now that I have proxmox setup*. I'd prefer not to be manually spinning up containers I know portainer is a popular tool for this but I'm considering a k8s enviroment. 
 What's your go to method for bootstrapping k8s? I know k8s is overkill for self-hosted but it's what's used at work so I'd like to make it more part of my daily.

 Let's say, I have an gmail account and I want to archive mails from there on my server.
 I imagine something like a pop3 account, pulling mails to mbox, from there you use restic, rsync or whatever to backup the current state.
 Is there a solution for that, or do I have to script it myself?

 I curretly have a DELL POWEREDGE R720 2U RACK SERVER 2x E5-2620 v2, 32GB, PERC H710 MINI, but due to energy prices I am looking for a lower power solution as id like to run it 24/7 if possible.
 I also got a synology ds2413+ from the local uni but cant seem to access it in any way ( it powers on and even has lan indicators but cant find it on my network)
 id like to run: Plex, raddar, sonnar, nextcloud, pihole and Backblaze, also some gaming servers as an extra bonus if possible.
 Im currently leaning towards getting a ddr4 mb/cpu and gutting the synology as its compact and has enough drive bays.
 also on a side note id like to get some low power devices to stream netflix youtube ect as the "smart" tv ads do my head in, was thinking a pi but not sure if they can handle 4k. 
 Edit: got a pi4 4gb as the 4k "receiver"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty large physical movie collection (mixture of blu-rays and 4k UHD blu-rays). 99% of the time I'm watching these movies at my PC on my 21:9 ultrawide monitor, so I started ripping the files off the disk and put them on an external drive.
 The problem is I have a mini-ITX PC that is already packed to the brim and can't fit any extra drives beyond the couple m.2 slots on the motherboard. I also don't have a lot of desk space to store a large desktop HDD, NAS, etc., etc. I decided on a 5TB portable USB-powered external, because at least at the time (and I think still now) that was the largest size I could get in that form factor). 
 When 4k blu-ray files are upwards of 60gb and regular blu's are like 30gb, a 5TB would fill up relatively quickly. So I started encoding the files using handbrake (for a number of reasons, but one being I could knock those file sizes down by at least half, if not more). 
 I'm using Nvidia NVenc to encode my files because it's a lot faster using the GPU vs CPU, but I've only just recently realized that the quality suffers. Tbh, it's not the worst thing in the world I've ever seen, but when I compare it to the original ripped movie file I can see the difference and now I can't live with it. 
 So, now I'm thinking I'm not going to encode at all and just gonna store the original movie files as is. I guess this means I'm gonna need a lot more than 5TB, though, but my problem still stands that I just don't have a lot of desk space for larger external drives. 
 The other issue is that anything more than those 2.5" portable drives usually require their own power brick and it will be nearly impossible for me to access an outlet at this point around my desk. 
 Do I have any options? Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions based on my restrictions?

 Recently I created a tracker system, useful to track value over time (e.g. I use it to track the gasoline price when I refuel my car, to track my weight, my car mileage, etc.)
 Both the backend and the react native app are open source.
 It's a really simple side project, I'm sure a lot of alternative are available, but if you want to use it or improve it, please feel free to do so!
 The backend is written in golang (simply because I wanted to better understand the language) and use docker container. While the frontend is written in typescript (react-native).

 i have a HDD full of pdf, xlsx and docx files on a Linux server. All of the pdfs have an ocr layer. At the moment I access these files via smb and different clients (e. g. PDF Expert App on iOS or Finder on MacOS). Now I want to search for the content of pdf files but I can’t find a way to do this. Is there any software that creates an index on the server so that every client can access it and find files through this index? 
 Any help is appreciated!

 I am running a PC which is turned on 24/7 (Win 10). It also functions as a Plex Server. All SATA ports are occupied and there is no space left so I need to attach some more storage. 
 If I use the HBA adapter, is it possible to show every single HDD as an individual one, just by connecting them and power them in? Kind of plugging in 16 HDDs via USB or directly to a SATA port. File system would be NFTS. I was just wondering, cause I was always reading about JBOD, zfs etc. And acutely I do not want JBOD as of now. Maybe in the future when I upgrade my PC I was thinking about to switch to unRAID or something similar. 
 Thanks in advance :)

Looking at Passmark, they both score basically the same (1% difference) so are there any advantages to getting the 8100t over the 7500t given that there is 1 generation difference and they're both 4 core machines? I'll be using the machine as a NAS, Next Cloud and also running the *arrs and Emby (or Jellyfin) for now with more to come later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I inherited a 2010(ish) drobo pro from work. I know it’s old but it’s still decent and I’m poor. From what I’ve seen, drobo is not doing great and a lack of support for this might put me in a bind in the near future. I’ve also heard these can mess up your drives but I don’t understand how. 
 Is it possible to use this as a DAS? Or even just a big ass external raid drive? 
 I can get something else for backup, but can I do this? Or is this thing useless at this point?
 Note: I’d like to use this for active video editing. Is it fast enough for that? (I’ve been using usb external drives so equivalent to that is fine)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 I am looking to downgrade my homelab setup (currently 120w idle) to something like a micro PC for power efficiency as I am a student, and energy is getting expensive for me in Australia. I have 4x2TB drives that I would like to utilize, however, the micro PCs can't accommodate more than one 2.5" drive.
 Can I connect a DAS to one of these systems? Currently interested in the Dell 3050 for its price here.
 I was looking at other power efficient fujitsu boards, but I cannot find any in australia, and they are out of my budget anyway.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers

 It's important to emphasize that the material I'm talking about is related to my studies (there's nothing exclusive, nothing overly private, or illegal.); only video materials I created for school, lectures, and personal presentations stacked up over the past few years.
 I'm talking about gigabytes.
 I'm a student who is also unemployed, and I don't have the money to keep anything in a paid cloud.
 I no longer have enough storage on my devices, therefore I need something to tide me over till I can afford a hard drive.

I'm currently using SFTPGo as my file handling service, and I have port forwarding configured and working with my ISP's static IP allocation. It all works perfectly, and it's all TOS above board, too!
 I'm wondering about the security implications of this type of arrangement though. I heard about a DMZ as a way to stop people from trying to hack into servers, but I don't really know what that does or if it's necessary. How often should I apply patches and updates? Is there anything else I'm missing?

I find it a bit strange that no one seems to talk about that on here or even really consider it as an option. Of course, on top of that, I also have Owncloud with my Windows file shares mounted so that I can more easily access files with mobile devices or outside of my home. I just find that I access my files almost solely through my Windows explorer and a Windows File Server seems to be the best option. Any thoughts on this approach?

And I am aware of the shortages as it has been the same exact experience for PC parts too (mainly GPUs), but is there no way to find a Coral AI Edge TPU that is closer to the original MSRP price?
 I reached out to Mousser, but their estimated ship date is May of 2024. Arrow electronics seems to have them available within the next 3 weeks, but you would need to purchase 1500+ units as they do not allow a single unit purchase.
 I really do want to try the Coral AI Edge TPU for things like Frigate and also Tensorflow. Does anyone have any creative idea on getting hands on one of these? Or is the best bet to sucker up and purchase one off Amazon for 2X the price?

 I currently archive these webpages by using Safari's "Save to PDF" function. It makes a really clean PDF with no page breaks. However, there isn't a keyboard shortcut for it by default, and the prompt that comes up asking where to save it has a delay, and saving a separate file with the original URL (with a similar filename so it can be correlated to its respective PDF) can only be done manually by dragging the URL bar to a Finder window.
 I currently have over 500 webpages in my queue. My existing methods get me through about 2.5 a minute, which is still absurdly long. I have a server where my data is, and can host nearly any OS. Is there any way I can expedite this process, or perhaps get a new one?
 I'm looking to render the webpage, not save cookies, save it as a PDF, and have that PDF have the URL on it, or a partnered process that saves the URL separately. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tried a Czur ET24 for yearbook scanning. While the speed and software was good, was disappointed not as good as a flatbed, particularly for photo/graphic details. Like I scanned a black and white page and would give it a C grade. I scanned a regular color photo and I'd give the scan quality a D grade. Big disappointment. Any overhead scanner better such as the fujitsu? Or even an affordable large format scanner rec? Anyone have scan image comparisons?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello selfhoster, I've been having the problem for about 48 hours that I have unbelievable timeouts of up to 48000 ms in uptime kuma.
 a short explanation of my setup:
 Hp proliant microserver with proxmox, -> openmediavault runs on it as NAS and for docker/portainer. uptime kuma and a few other containers (e.g. nextcloud, audiobookshelf, paperless, photoprism) are running here.
 A few services/containers partially access the internet via a reverse proxy.
 audiobookshelf, in particular, has repeatedly noticed extreme timeouts in the last few hours, BUT: only out of my own network. the monitor type is set to https - GET
 I have a extern vps on which uptime kuma is also running and entered the same URLs to check. with which it does not come to errors, or timeouts.
 ​
 what could be the reason? updates from containers or similar were not installed at the time the problems occurred. can I somehow check my internet connection? a ping command to my public ip from the vps only resulted in timeouts of 9-10 ms. feel free to write me any ideas.

My backup has plenty of space, so I want to set up regular backups of all of our desktops/laptops. I have used EaseUS ToDo backup in the past. And it worked ok. But something about it just doesn't feel right. Like it's "Chinese software just waiting to take my data" or something haha. That and I found that if I didn't keep an eye on it, it was complaining about being out of date, or has ads or whatever. I was debating about other options like just using Windows built in backup capabilites. Using the free version of Veeam and install the agent on each PC. Or Simply setting a batch file in a scheduled task to run robocopy to the backup share on a regular basis or at startup. This wouldn't get a system image level backup or retain history but at least files would be duplicated and easily accessible. Plenty of options out there and just wondering what everyone else does.

 Do you fine folks diversify your drives across NAS/NVR units periodically? I have a modest 2-4x8TB NAS units and a single 4x8TB NVR unit. I am about to expand to a third NAS and a second NVR unit in a second physical location on my WAN. When I buy the new drives, I am considering hot-swapping them into my existing deployment to create a diversified mix of drive ages in each unit. Presently, the operating units each have drives of all the same age and power time, although each unit was deployed at a different point in time.

 10.9 Mavericks
 10.13 High Sierra
 10.14 Mojave

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective: Replace buggy Marvell-based PCIe eSATA card with suitable SAS HBA in a Desktop computer running Windows 10 Pro, for use with individual drives in self-powered eSATA enclosures.
 Question: Can this support connecting SATA drives in external, self-powered eSATA connector enclosures that can be connected while the PC is booted up and Windows is running ? And conversely, will it be possible to disconnect such drives with the Windows option to "Safely Remove Hardware" while the PC is running?
 I've searched for hours and can't find answer to this question, but perhaps I'm not asking correctly, and this is actually a question of "Can you hot swap external drives connected to SAS HBA" ? 🤐 
 I realize most people are using HBA cards for more extensive, dedicated, always-on storage purposes. I really want to have option to connect SATA drives in external eSATA enclosures to my Win10 PC, AND have the option to attach them while Windows is running, and remove them using the Safely Remove Hardware option, also while Windows is running. I'd also like to be able to connect more than 2 at the same time.
 Your experience and guidance here will be VERY appreciated....THANKS !

And since I expect these are going to last me for quite awhile I want to make sure I'm kicking things off right. I'll be consolidating various other drives onto these and using some for clients.
 Would love it if some of you could share what you like to do to get a new drive up and running in terms of formatting, cluster sizes, surface tests, stress tests, smart tests, etc. 
 What got me thinking of this is u/Malossi167's comment in this thread (so thanks!). Would love to see what steps others use.
 For the record these are likely to remain unshucked, GPT formatted Windows drives. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 i'm hosting a Matrix Synapse Server and we we are using Element as client since 2021. 
 I must say, element is really full of major bugs which take way to long to be fixed. The biggest problem are the inconsistent appearing bugs with authentification and encryption. The important implemented features dont work poperly. I've the feeling, the devs are focusing on nice-2-have features but not fixing the really really bad major bugs.
 ​
 So my question is: Are there any good selfhosting chat server alternatives for matrix with a good AND stable/ working client?

Also, is there some kind of external storage that has its own built in memory to make it easier for my computer to view?

 I live in Europe and back in 2018 a friend of mine was in the US and picked up a few Easystore 8TBs for me. I shucked them all and put them in my Synology NAS. All worked bar one which could not be detected. I connected it back to my PC first using a WD Elements adapter/case (the Euro version of the Easystore) and the drive was not even detected. Then I used the Easystore "adapter" and it powered up but it was detected as a 2TB drive and I could do nothing with it. Windows Disk Manager said it needed to be initialized but threw an error when I tried. WD Utilities said the SMART test failed and that I had apparently entered a password wrong 5 times. The only option was to Erase but then it threw an exception with no details when I tried that. It was a legit disk too, not one that someone had swaped out and sent back to the store. Since I was not in the US and I had shucked it I assumed I would get no help from WD and put it in a box and forgot about it.
 So now in 2022 its out of warranty and I am curious if there is anything I can do to revive it? Amazingly I still had the adapter from the Easystore case attached to it. I plugged it in again today and it was the same as before. I dont hear any funny sounds either. It spins up when I connect it to the computer, shows up in Disk Manager, still as 2TB but I still cant do anything with it.
 One thing I am not sure about is whether the Easystore adapter I am using is the one that came with the 8TB drive. I had a batch of Easystore 3TB drives previously and it may be from those so maybe that is having trouble with the 8TB drive. The product id is 25fb firmware revision 3004 according to WD Utilities

 I would like to somehow pipe this device file to my x86 server and run zwave-js-ui there. Any existing tools or whatnot that could help me accomplish that?

 I am trying to see if there is a simple way to mass-export articles. I've been playing around with IMPORTXML in GoogleSheets, while I have been able to pull dates, titles, descriptions, images of articles, I have been unable to pull the actual article content itself.
 For context, I'm basically working on a passion project of some transcripts of a podcast I like, that I wanted to print and bind for personal reading. There are over 50 posts so I was curious if there was some way to mass export these. I'm dreading copying and pasting the content from each article. 
 I should note that I am not a developer and know nothing about writing/running scripts. Hoping there might be an easy way for a novice to pull this. 
 ​
 Thank you for any help or direction!

 We have a 1GB/s wired network connection and are looking to max it out when uploading the rather large files (20-40gb/ea) to S3.
 My question is- what software is the fastest to upload to S3? It is probably a Mac, but we should have access to a Windows box if needed. It has to be a GUI as the user is somewhat technical, but not comfortable with the command line.

 Is there a webui for browsing and finding media that can connect to my apps, possibly with RT and Metacritic scores? They really nailed down the app if you know what you want... but what if you want to browse?
 Are there browser apps that can just send calls to Sonarr and Radarr from RT, IMDB or Metacritic?
 Edit: I went with Jellyseer and a Firefox plugin for Sonarr/Radar. Still no scores but the browsing is what you'd expect.

 I am not sure if this is a good deal tho, but i am thinking of it bc i got a bunch (like 25x 3.5" 3tb) Sas drives laying around i dont really have a place for since i am usually only using higher capacity exos drives in my newer servers.

Some email provider, that shall remain anonymous, that I'm using for my business email had a couple of hour long dropouts in services in the past couple of months where I could not send or receive emails while the cPanel emails kept on ticking without a problem.
 Dropouts can happen even in big companies so I thought to myself - Why not? Why shouldn't I host my own email?
 I have a VPS with a dedicated clean IP (I have checked has not been in any blacklists recently). I am confident enough that I can configure everything well enough to get a good score on mail-tester.com with mailcow docker deployment.
 I plan to first test it on my own domain and then after everything checks out migrate the clients one by one.
 What can go wrong?

 So after I tried it, I noted is the same free version, but without your data going out. 
 So after a little Google-Fu, I've discovered LibreGrammar, community a fork from LanguageTool, but with all premium features enabled, and works with the extensions as the vanilla server. 
 I'm trying right now, and now shows the passive voice suggestions, the only drawback is a little outdated from the upstream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Other than just using your Homelab as a test environment to break and learn things. Who here actually uses it as a portfolio for what they know to show to potential employers. I’m still in Highschool (16) and got my first job over the summer working for the IT director of my school. I got to do it with my friend and made really decent money ($15 an hour). And used some of that money to make my Homelab completely overkill for someone my age. I learned some basic web development and created a homepage for my homelab domain (broomfieldhomelab.net) and am thinking of sending it to my IT director to see if it’s applicable to put on a resume for when I get a ‘real’ job after I graduate. Does anyone else here use their lab as a showing point for their skills?
 Edit: grammar

 Dockers stay fresh with Watchtower, but the hosts still need manual maintenance I'd rather not do.
 If it matters, this stack is running on Proxmox VE with a few VMs and a few LXCs (mostly on Debian, some on Alpine).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm bringing online a 12GBPS SAS Jbod with 90 18tb drives on it and am stuck trying to decided between a couple deployment scenarios. 
 I can deploy with a 1950x (16 core threadripper) or a more modern 5950x (16 core ryzen) both with 128gb of ram. I was leaning to the thread ripper as i'm not entirely sure i'm going to run anything on the host much beyond the OS and the 5950x has a better resell value should I decide to sell it. Any real reason to go 5950x over the thread ripper? Power consumption isn't really an issue. 
 I've got a bunch of systems in play already here (with about 1/4 of 2pb used across a few Supermicro builds / jbods) that i'm going to consolidate here. I'm thinking once I get the data over (I have serious data backed up in two off site locations) i'm going to rebuild the other systems into a ceph cluster. For now, i'm debating truenas or proxmox with zfs pools. I'm thinking 10 of 9 drives with one hotspare per, but i'm open to other suggestions. 
 Feel free to tell me where I'm probably making the wrong decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm wondering if these specs would be good for a new server me and a friend are making. We're going to be using it for virtual machines whose uses will be web-hosting, file/media storage, a few low spec gaming VMs, game servers (Minecraft etc.) and maybe some machine learning. 
 We're also wondering how to set it up, such as which hypervisor to use as well as how we can pass through/split the GPU between multiple VMs, or can the card only be dedicated to 1 VM?
 We're wanting to keep it desktop sized (E-ATX) so it fits on my desk and so that we don't have tiny, 15 000 000 000 rpm fans, if we were to get a rack mounted server.
 Last thing, we don't need over the top storage, just a decent sized SSD and a couple of TB HDD(s), but the prices seem quite high (the HDD included in the specs below are barracuda 4TB). Does anyone know of some cheap HDD alternatives?
 Thanks for any help
 
  
Motherboard: jingsah x99 dual f2: £160
 CPUs: 2x Xeon e5 2670 v3, 12 cores, 24 threads, 3.1GHz, 120W TDP: £60 for both
 RAM: 2x 32GB (64GB) DDR4 2400MHz ECC: 2x£45 (£90)
 Case: DeepCool MATREXX 55 Mesh E-ATX, supports E-ATX: £44
 PSU: 850W Corsair, Modular, Gold Rated, has the 2x8pins we need for CPUs: £99
 Storage Drives: 1TB m.2 + 2x4TB HDD : £71 + 2(£80) = £231
 GPU: Asus Strix gtx 1080 8GB: £205
 Switch: Netgear GS305E 5x1Gps ports: £20
 Coolers: 2x DEEPCOOL GAMMAXX GT BK: 2x £35 (£70)
 Fans: upHere 6x 120mm in 1 pack with fan hub: £30
  
 
 Total without drives: £778 With drives: £1009 (I could look for some cheaper drives/get some second hand if they're in good condition)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Picked up this wanworx by ecessa router to use for pfsense for my home. I was hoping it was less proprietary inside, but I did not luck out.... ecessa has no hardware info posted, but luckily I figured out its similar to a Lanner Fw 7582, and they have a user manual! It details all the headers on the motherboard thankfully and specifications. 
 Box came with pfsense installed, 4gb ddr3 ram, i5 3.0ghz, and a 50gb ssd. Also has an expansion module with 4 additional NIC. Appears to be a pcie x8 interface so maybe in the future I can use a pcie riser and plop a fiber interface in the rear card slot if I ever want to upgrade. 
 My plans are to use it for pfblockerng and openvpn for remote access. 
 One fun thing I ran into is I want to pull the expansion module, no need for it drawing power, but then it changes the interface numbering (I think) so I can't access the LAN configuration screen of pfsense. I'll have to work on that and make a serial cable for the console port.
 Anyone have much experience with these? Are they decent?

 Some manufacturer like Seagate and WD allows for drive conversion.

 Synology DS920+
 1 WD Ultrastar 20tb drive (or red, still researching and deciding which to get)
 And then 3 more HDs of varying size
 ​
 Not really relevant but I'll be using this to host my plex server I share with friends+family, videos I shoot myself (hobbyist videographer and photographer), and general data storage such as programs, games maybe, the works. 
 ​
 Question is the ds920+ is $549.99, Ultra star is $386, and a 12tb ultrastar is $210 at the moment.
 ​
 I'm willing to pay these prices but I'd just get salty if I pull the trigger on all that stuff now and then in a month I go back and look at all the money I could have saved. I also don't even know if stuff like this goes on sale during the holidays (pretty sure hds do but not familiar enough to say for sure)
 ​
 So ya, what do you guys think I should do!

 Our needs are pretty simple. Course material is primarily text and pictures (not video). Don't need formal grading or certifications, just a way to guide people through the learning process.

 I'm very interested in downsizing my home lab, which right now is a great power sink and space heater.
 I'm interested if anyone has used these beelink tiny computers, and if they like them, or had experience with it and running ESXI. My review of the reviews didn't show anyone running it with ESXI, so my initial guess was this model is relatively new, or maybe it's not too popular for home labbers? I had originally looked at the Intel NUC, but to get these specs I'd pretty much have to double the price.
 I prefer ESXi because it's what I'm running now and have that momentum, but could migrate to something else if this hardware wouldn't work.
 Appreciate any thoughts from the community.

 A friend of mine complained that the internet speed was too low, speed test gives 30mbs down but he's subscribed for 250. The ISP sent a technician and he disconnected the coaxial cable from the combo modem/router and connected it to a handheld testing device and said that the speed at the cable is 1000 mbs, so it is even higher than the subscription, hence the problem is with the router. 
 While this maybe true that the modem/router combo has an issue, but my question is what is this device? And can it really read a speed? Or just cable quality?
 I have been trying to lookup the device that can read internet speed at the coaxial cable but can't find anything

Is there some software I can spin up on my server to stream from? My thoughts are that I could connect a cell phone to my server, the phone captures the video and sends to the server, the server records the video and Livestreams it to a public url.
 Normally I would do more research before asking here but given the circumstances I thought I would ask for suggestions. Thank you.

Some are old (gone) machine backups, phone backups, training videos I wanted to make sure were not lost. Other than periodic confirmation the archives are ok I have no need to access them.
 Does anyone use Amazon's long term storage like Glacier? https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/
 For still readily available, milliseconds to few hours, a TB is about $5/mo. I hate a monthly fee; however to know that is taken care of could be worth it. With that and a local hard drive I would feel comfortable about the data.
 There is even a long-term, slow access (12 hours), for about $1/TB/mo. Ultimately this is probably what most of my data needs, but I need to get comfortable with it first.
 Any opinions of Glacier? Are there other similar services that are good/better/cheaper?

 I'm looking to extend my Dell T420 host with a single 2TB PCIe NVMe drive, to be used as a datastore in ESXi (alongside the existing RAID 10 of 8 x 7.2k spinning rust). 
 Initially this will just be used to host the boot drives of some VMs which are sluggish on the current RAID, but I'd also like the freedom to put some more IO-heavy (aka disk-thrashing) workloads on here in the near future, without worrying about having to buy a new NVMe drive every year.
 Anyone got any recommendations for high-endurance PCIe NVMe drives, with good access times and 3Gbps throughput (and which haven't done sneaky business like downgrading components for the same drive model)? 
 Cheers in advance!

 I volunteer as a driver for a non-profit meals delivery organization. They're currently managing it via Google Sheets, and Google Maps 🫣. I'd like to propose to them a solution (if it exists) that can house their data (delivery destinations, meal types, routes, etc.). 
 This would primarily be used by the back-office folks, but bonus if there's a mobile interface that the drivers could use to help track their deliveries, mileage, etc. 
 I'm hoping there's a OOTB solution, but I'm not opposed to looking at helping customize something as well (I'm think a CRM, as that's what it basically seems to be - I've installed Odoo and am starting to play around in it). 
 Would love your thoughts!

 ​
  
What will happen if I clone disk A -> B but there's some data on the B drive ?
 Should I format my the drive I plan to clone the data on ?
  
I plan to use this docking station to make a copy a drive.
 Disk A -> Cloned to Disk B -> Uploaded to off-site server -> snapshots made everyday 
 Do I need to know anything before proceeding like this ?
 Thanks in advance!

 I see that I can buy 4 hard drives, each with 16 TB to do this, but do not know if there is a better solution. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having gotten done with my NAS, I now installed two 12TB drives internally in my desktop PC. They’re not the main drives - my primary C: drive is a striped set of SSDs. But the new drives, for lack of any motivation one way or another, I’ve setup as RAID0. My motherboard handles the RAID and so now I’ve got a single 24TB volume in Windows. I’m using Win7 Pro still but that’s fine. The usage for this drive will be a lot of virtual machines, as well as a junk drive for downloading and parsing through gobs of data to save what I want and trash the rest. Aside from that, no idea… whatever the future holds. I’m also getting a RAM upgrade in a few days I’ll be installing new chips and get myself up to 32GB RAM. Mostly to accommodate running a bunch of VMs. 
 So, my question is: do you think raiding them is overkill and unnecessary, and should I instead make them jbods? I’ve had this machine for quite a few years already and the mobo has done a great job with my C drive raid, so I don’t really have any worries about messing up an array due to anything other than actual damage. 
 I’m just trying to make the best decision now, before the drive starts to really accumulate a lot of data. 
 Thanks for any opinions you may have.

I have my beyond important files synced to google, but that doesn't help me much in the event of me needing to redeploy a container in a pinch when my home network is out.
 Bought a PiBox loaded it with omv/docker/portainer and a pair of mirrored ssds. Is there a way to automate backing up the dockers from my other machines and run certain backups as redundant containers that can act independently if connected to another network?

 I have considered SSH'ing into my home machine but there are no ports open on their machines. 
 I've seen some tools such as chrome remote desktop but the ones I've seen either require either a plugin on the control machine, (which would not be possible) or a confirmation from the host machine, (also not possible of course).
 I am considering the possibility of setting up a site which allows for control of a remote environment. No sensitive files would be present so security concerns aside... Am I thinking along the right tracks? Would this solution be trivial? Sub-optimal?
 Any advice would be appreciated. I have investigated many options but they all seem to assume that the non host machine /network are not entirely locked down. Many thanks.

 Preferably, I'd like to be able to update my calendar and the guests' view to update automatically without intervention from me.
 This is so I can share my availability with others without exposing personal data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's the run-down on my current setup. I have two 1TB Western Digital Blue drives on my main machine, running a Windows Storage Pool (Mirroring). That's it.
 I plan on upgrading in the near future though. Thinking about two drives somewhere in the realm of 6-10TB.
 Once I do that, I'll probably be buying an enclosure like a QNAP TR-002, which would be hardware RAID.
 My question is, is hardware RAID more desirable than software RAID? And should I be worried about my current software RAID setup on Windows?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title said, I am looking to expand my PC's storage. I currently have a Toshiba Enterprise Capacity MG07 12TB. But I am really annoyed by the clicking sounds when the drive is working (relatively silent when idle). I know this sound level is typical of enterprise-class HDDs though.
 In Germany, all the cheapest drives (cost per TB) are enterprise-class, which makes me wonder where all the consumer drives are? They don't make those anymore?
 What choice do I have if I want to outfit my PC with around 40-60TBs of storage while not having to endure the noise levels of enterprise drives? 40-60TB of SSDs would be too expensive.
 Any input would be much appreciated. Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm setting up a bunch of services to become a self-employed IT-support. I also do other things that I'd like to advertise as well such as bicycle maintanance, gardening help, painting walls, photography and that sort of stuff.
 I have chosen Hetzner to run all of this. Currently I have Jitsi Meet on jitsi.domain-one.tld and Tactical RMM on domain-two.tld. domain-two.tld is not going to be advertised, it's just for convenience and separation of services. domain-one.tld currently has no front page.
 I'm going to print some ads, go around town and put them on bulletin boards in local shops, libraries and so on. What I need is some nice front page where a potential customer can have some basic info and contact me. Hoping for some spam protection as well but something very simple a grandma can handle.
 All ideas are very welcome. How would you set this type of thing up? Very curious what others have done. Billing is handled by a 3rd party so I'm putting the customer data on their site and they send the bills via email.
 Thank you!

 As far as I can tell they can both be selfhosted and both are free for personal use.
 Both look to support LDAP (which I use so people only have to manage one username and password).
 Does anyone have any opinions on either option, good or bad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have now - after long time of hesitance - installed OpenFaaS on my RPi K8s Cluster. I had it planned for a while because of the scale to zero functionality I randomnly saw on YouTube once (faasIdler or so)...
 After installing it yesterday I was looking for that and found out that this is (now?) a OpenFaaS Pro exclusive feature.
 Before I lock myself in the (Open)FaaS ecosystem, I wanted to ask if there are alternatives for scale to zero you know of? It's just a charming idea that a small function doesn't idle most of the time when it's only invoked 5 times a day - while not important enough to get pro subscription for that.
 PS: I wasn't even able to find a price for OpenFaaS Pro. Does anyone have an idea or do I have to get called by them to find out the cost?

So, soon i will be building local server and since i don't have much experience in that field i decided to search online. More i looked deeper into the pit i fallen. Now i don't even about OS that i will use. I am used to Windows environment so i didn't even think about other options. To cut to the point, i will be having 12 (or 10) HDD's of 18TB, that i wanted to put into raid 10 but after searching through here i dont know anymore if its good idea. I need single volume of at least 60TB, that will have decent performance and be used by 5-10 people at any given time. (OS would go on separate drives). Files that go through the server are usually around 200MB on avg, but can go as high as 15-20GB's. Thank you in advance.

 Is there a way to archive a copy or somehow download all posts (plus the comments on each post)? When I requested my data from reddit, all they did was let me download a zip file with a bunch of confusing excel spread sheets which are essentially useless.
 Anyone have ideas on how to preserve my reddit account history to have a backup of all the data I've shared in my posts throughout the years? I really appreciate any insight, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I upgraded my personal computer and NAS with Mellanox CX512A, from ConnectX-2 and -3. Before the upgrade I've been getting speeds very, very close to 10 Gb/s.
 NAS is Intel S5520HC (dual LGA1366 X5690) with 192 GB of RAM, and the card sits in PCIe 2.0 x8 slot. It's running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
 PC is Z170/i7 desktop with 64 GB of RAM, with the card sitting in PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, and Win10 Pro 21H2. I have 25G DAC cable and both ethtool and Windows betwork panel pick up the connection as 25Gb/s. In both cases cards have sufficient airflow, in a form of a 140 mm 2000 rpm fan blowing over all PCIe devices.
 iperf3 -p 1 shows ~8.3 Gb/s, while -p 4, usually slightly lower, 7.9-8.1 Gb/s. File transfer peaks at ~700 MB/s to ramdisk over SMB and ~730 MB/s over NFS (that's from NVMe, of course).
 I don't see particularly high CPU usage on either side.
 I tried enabling RDMA, but it dropped speeds by around 1 Gb/s.
 I must admit this is not an upgrade I have expected. I do understand that my hardware is not exactly compatible (half PCIe connectivity on both platforms), but both 2.0 x8 and 3.0 x4 deliver around 4 GB/s bandwidth to each of the devices, and I do understand that Windows is not exactly the best system for high speed networks, but maybe there is something I can do in this situation that will help with transfer speed?

However, not everything on my network is listed there. From the UI of my router, I can make some of the dynamic DHCP clients static, which makes them queryble from DNS server in router. I want CoreDNS to fall back to the router dns if nothing found in db.my.domain. 
 As an example, dig @corednsip myphone.my.domain returns NXDOMAIN but dig @routerip myphone.mydomain returns expected IP, which makes me believe that coredns is ignoring forward if it first tries file.

 When I go to the 'change' option, it won't let me increase the size of available space.
 Any help would be much appreciated and if further information is required, please let me know. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have researched this many times over the years and find more and more great solutions emerging each year. I stopped hosting in 2015 because I moved to a location with no broadband internet and the best solution I had was a tethered cell phone with terrible speed and CGNAT. Now I have T-mobile unlimited home internet with 130-230 down and 20-35 up. So I have the speed for it, but still no port forwarding.
 Now here are the solutions and resources research has pointed out to me. Just curious which of them are better choices in current times. I will be hosting multiple VM's/containers including plex to a few users for music and occasional video. Also hosting cloud storage for a few cell phones to store photos and videos for freeing up local storage on devices. And home assistant which I currently pay the cloud fee for and that cost can go towards a more global solution
 ngrok - already using the free one of this for plex which is great. Wish the paid version was priced down a little more, but still open to it.
 cloudflare - looks very popular and similar to ngrok and priced similar.
 localXpose - have not tried but looks similar to ngrok, but more affordable.
 portmap io - looks to be like the above but uses openvpn to which I could setup on my router directly.
 openvpn to a friend/family router to use there ipv4 port forwarding and free DDNS - This is probably what I would have done years ago before the tunneling solutions above became mainstream. Honestly still open to this too though.
 VPS with VPN - have only lightly researched this one. Was going to test on my free AWS account, but read that it gets expensive if much data is uses across AWS, so would need a cheaper host.
 unknown - A wiser choice I am overlooking?

 I got a ransom some months ago losing all the data, but i had never made a server before so i'd no idea on how to secure it.
 Maybe my error is open the rdp port on the windows rdp service.
 THe only thing someone told to me is that i need a vpn.
 So i'm here to ask for advices, what i should do? I should buy a router in order to make an OpenVPN or similar vpn on that server?
 i should not use the windows rdp to connect to my machine (that is windows 10)?
 I should buy a cheap vps to make a reverse proxy?
 I should install docker to make "containers" for each thing i use (game server, sftp, rdp for blender, etc)?
 I need to use also somehting for SFTP to save data (images, videos, projects, etc) in my HDDs, what should i do?
 ​
 Thank you for any tip ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up a Poweredge R620 and a pair of LSI cards from ebay to upgrade my linux NAS. The first card was running the full Dell RAID firmware so I pulled down the LSI 20.00.07 firmware, flashed it, and after rebooting it sees my individual drives as expected. This card is still dropping alerts on the console that one chip is at 51C and the other chip is at 59C.
 The second card was running LSI IT firmware v13, and even though it already saw my connected drives I flashed it with the same new firmware, rebooted, and confirmed all four chips between both boards are running the new firmware. Oddly, the second board is no longer reporting the temperature, and it was running at 50C/66C so it's definitely above the threshold that should be reported. This board is also in the slot against the side of the case and is surrounded by the framework so I expected it to be running hotter anyway.
 Now this second board was also running the oldest firmware, but considering its position I don't think a firmware change could really drop the temps down below what the first card (which is more in the open and getting better airflow) is reporting.
 So I'm stumped. All four chips were flashed from the same firmware file (I also flashed the onboard PERC H710 from the same file) so I don't understand why one board would stop reporting the high temps while the other board still shows them. The test drives I plug into each controller are detected and reading just fine so I know the hardware is all working. I haven't been able to find a CLI utility that will give me the temps directly from the cards but I feel like something may have gone wrong so I want to at least be able to confirm the readings.
 So does anyone have suggestions for why this card stopped reporting the temps, and/or a utility I can grab to verify the actual temps? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mattermost is very similar to Slack/Teams--but it does not have a persistent voice room the way that Discord/Mumble does, so I am using a plugin for that. The plugin was recently archived on Github, but I tried the same version from the most recent release along with the version of Mattermost that would have been the most recent at the time, and I am having the same problem as the person does in this Issue thread (The heading of the voice channel area appears, but the actual channels do not populate).
 I am running Debian 10 on Digital Ocean, and PostgreSQL (I didn't think the db mattered, but I had never heard of that, and I only used it because I was following along someone else's instructions and they used it, so I thought I'd mention that).
 https://i.imgur.com/3XleCd1.png
 The solution that worked for the issue I posted above was that they had to add the listen port into the setting for the site URL. I opened this port, and I tried all combinations of versions of the Mattermost client + plugin, with and without this port in the URL, HTTP and HTTPS, and I am losing my mind not knowing what else to try. I am very new to Linux and very new to server configurations, so I just don't even know where to begin troubleshooting. Only now as I type this I realize that I never tried to downgrade the server, which could work.... If anyone has any tips on doing this with as little damage as possible, I would love the words of advice. 
 Also, the log file does not appear to have anything terribly helpful or out of place. It all looks to be loading the modules as normal with no issues. There are a ton of log files in my Mattermost folder, if there is a specific one I should focus on for this and look more closely at, please share.
 Or if anything jumps out at you that I could try before I downgrade the server, that would be great as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use some S3 compatible object storages (minio at my home network, wasabi on the cloud) where I backup my Android phone photos and some files on my nix-on-droid that I do not keep on git. 
 But the photos, specially, are very hard to distinguish by the name the camera app gives to them. A "file manager web ui/app" that can show image thumbs and allow me to more quickly (batch) manage the files on the bucket would be a dream. I know both Minio and Wasabi have a WebUI, but I find both archaic and too rudimentar for this purpose.
 So, my questions:
 1) Does anyone on this sub know a self-hosted app (supporting docker-compose, CasaOS or portainer stacks would be awesome) that I can use to do that? (not restricted to photos only, that was just an example ;)
 2) Not exactly self-hosted, but do you know if Nextcloud paid service supports that - case I go the lazy route but wish to help fund an open source company? 
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decided to start about 2 weeks ago from scratch, I have been learning basic linux (Ubuntu) and it has been going pretty well overall.
 I've started and restarted a few times when things start to get messy or confusing and a few tools in particular have been complete game changers. Specifically Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer both are huge headache savers.
 One thing I haven't been able to find that I really like is a straight forward web based server management tool. I've only really found cockpit which is kind of the right idea but seemed to cause some weird issues when I started experimenting with its containers.
 Question 1) Does anyone have a recommendation for an alternative to cockpit that at least will handle basic server monitoring (resources and whatnot) as well as have access to a terminal for jumping in for quick checks and whatnot.
 Question 2) Does anyone have a VPN suggestion? I just need something with basic functionality
 Question 3) Can I set up transmission only to use the VPN? It's in its own portainer container if that helps

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanna build a better home network with a little bit of monitoring while learning networking at the same time. I want a router, swtich, AP setup to separate device tasks, so I can learn about general network stuff as well as host my home webserver and other services, instead of having a one man band router that does everything.
 My question is, is what I'm looking at good for gigabit home network (will be used for gaming too):
 https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Integrated-Lightening-Protection-TL-R605/dp/B08QTXNWZ1/
 https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TL-SG108PE-Shielded-Lifetime-Protection/dp/B01BW0AD1W/
 ​
 I still haven't picked an access point, but it wont be necessary for the moment.
 I'd also love some small rack setup alternative.

 Please bear in mind MakeMKV was used to convert to MKA files and then converted them to WAV in Foobar2000, and while they were mostly good they still didn't hold up to the audio that plays when running the ISO file. I'm guessing converting the ISO to DSF and then WAV or FLAC would be the best way to do this? I'd appreciate any help on this because, honestly, I'm tired and lost of looking for the right way AND tools to do this.

 But to digress, i just want something easy and quick and dirty, is it ok to just run WIndows Server OS, Docker and just spin up all the conatiners i need? Would i be missing anything? is there another software i need for spinning up VMs? would a hypervisor type OS be THAT much more worth it in the end? just looking for some more insight

 So, I have 1tb of various private things (porn, memes etc) I'd like to keep on the cloud for easy access and viewing. I have a bunch of OneDrive space, but I've heard plenty of horror stories regarding people's accounts being shut down due to just private porn and would not like to risk the same fate. 
 Solution 1: Use cyberduck to encrypt and store in normal cloud. Unfortunately, this means if I simply want to view a file, I would have to use cryptomator to decrypt said files. I've had issues using cryptomator on its own due to sync issues. (Besides unsure if their ios and android app is any good) 
 Solution 2: Nas? Would be perfect however my technical skills are completely non-existent. I'd be happy to hire someone here locally to set it up but information on it already feels overwhelming. 
 Solution 3: Just say fuck it and store it unencrypted? 
 Not sure what you guys would recommend but yeah. Maybe this "perfect & seamless but also encrypted access" set up doesn't exist. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently repurposed my gaming rig (9400f, 16gb RAM, 1660TI) into a secondary server running RHEL9. I have taken a liking to running software as containers and particularly taken a liking to Podman due to just how easy it is to get going running unprivileged containers and some other nifty things such as systemd integration and generate/play kube.
 My first old server is under very heavy load, has no dedicated GPU and runs Plex in a Windows VM. I've been thinking of migrating Plex to this RHEL9 rig. What are the pros and cons of running Plex on Linux as a native RPM package vs a podman container? Some people report trouble getting NVIDIA hardware acceleration to work with Podman, but looking at various instructions it doesn't seem THAT hard (although obviously a fair bit more involved than just having NVIDIA drivers installed).
 What about the required NVIDIA container runtime, does it essentially replace the runtime provided by Podman or does it only affect containers specifically utilizing NVIDIA hardware? How well supported things are, is it safe to just have the system automatically update all OS updates + NVIDIA drivers (DKMS) + NVIDIA container-related packages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a good capture card with S-video input. Initially I was thinking about the AVerMedia CE310B due to its simplicity. However through a lot of reading I ended up finding out about the Blackmagic Design Intensity Pro 4k, which instead uses breakout cables attached to MORE breakout cables to capture S-Video.
 The Intensity Pro does seem somewhat more capable than the CE310B, but I am worried that introducing so many adapters is going to degrade the signal quality. After all, the breakout cables are using RCA connectors, which S-Video was deliberately designed to circumvent. I'm just a bit skeptical and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether or not that would be an issue, and of course I am also open to other capture card recommendations! 
 Thanks! (:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a hard time finding my specific scenario anywhere. I currently have a segmented L2 network but it's overtaxing my pfSense firewall. I am switching my Cisco SG300 with an ICX-6610 and want to have my trusted high-speed VLANs routed via L3 on the switch while keeping some on the firewall.
 DHCP/DNS is handled on Windows Server. I know I have to create router interfaces for my 4 trusted VLANs, change DHCP option 3 to the IP of that interface and then as it becomes the gateway for those devices, they will route on the switch. 
 If I ping a device on VLAN 200-Storage from VLAN 20-Trusted, it would work. However, what happens when a device on VLAN 20 wants to ping a device on VLAN 30-IoT? The rules on the firewall allow that, but how do I ensure what is NOT going to my L3 VLANs get routed to pfSense? 
 In other words, I want 4 of my VLANs to be L3 and everything else to be L2 with policy-based routing. I also want my L3 VLANs to be able to communicate with my L2 VLANs.
 Thanks!

 does anyone have any information on how to restore the folder tree from a NAS Drive?
 The NAS was a Buffalo Linkstation. I died some time ago but the HDD is fine. 
 I tried different programs but even testdisk couldnt solve it.
 Most important to me would be the folder structure, the files not that much (backup but unsorted).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people. I have been trying to find the perfect EPG grabber, but everything seems to be missing some nice features. So, I decided to fork Guide2go and add the features that, I believe, were missing.
 So far, I added:
 — The EPG guide includes a Live/New icon for premiere shows and movies. Guide2Go does this natively, however, players like Titivate won't read XML tags. This solves that problem.
 — Added an EPG server. Now, Guide2Go will grab images from SD and act as a server for those images; it will download the images and cache them locally to avoid kill calling SD API. This is very useful for clients like Plex or Emby. Very similar to what 123EPG does (Actually, not similar, but the same feature).
 — Added the option to not download the images locally, but to call SD API every time a client needs an image. This is useful if you only have one or two clients with few EPG days downloaded. If you have many channels, this will not work for you. SD has a limit in the number of images that can be downloaded directly.
 ​
 I accept constructive criticism in the Code, I am not a developer by any means. So, expect some weirdness in my code.

 I'd like to self-host three services :
  
Jitsi (Zoom alternative)- to host approx 15 people at a time
 Nextcloud - to serve around 15 people
 Jellyfin - to host about 2T of videos and audios
  
I am thinking to use Digital Ocean, Linode or some alternative(looking for recommendations)
 The question:
 What is the best way(price and computational powers) to go about this :
 - All three services on one server (is this difficult to do)
 - Three separate servers
 ​
 And any general advice on hosting, will also be gratefully received

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently setup filebrowser on my NAS and got it up and running. I use a Synology NAS so in order for it to work, instead of using the PUID/PGID I normally would for my admin profile, I had to use the root credentials in order for the permissions to be approved. This is what my stack looks like
 version: "3" services: file-browser: image: filebrowser/filebrowser container_name: file-browser user: 0:0 ports: - 4000:80 volumes: - /volume1:/srv - /volume1/docker/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db restart: unless-stopped 
 I have read this post which is on this sub regarding setting this up using command runner. If I apply 
 /bin/sh -c 'if [[ "$FILE" != "/srv/Trash/"* ]]; then mv $FILE /srv/Trash; fi' 
 to the before delete area, update it and create a 'Trash' folder using filebrowser, I get a 500 internal error. If I create a 'Trash' folder by mounting a new share from my NAS GUI, then it resolves the 500 internal area. However when I am able to delete again, the file is not moved to the trash folder that was created. I have no idea where the files go other then being completely destroyed. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do to get the recycle feature to work using the command runner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a smallish tech firm. We do many things including computer repair(even board level repair), software troubleshooting, etc. While we have a fair number of residential customers, we've also got a number of commercial clients for whom we do not only the aforementioned, but also managed backups. A typical client setup would be a Synology Diskstation to match their needs along with a Synology C2 cloud account. We have their workstations use Synology's 'Active Backup for Business' which will backup workstations on our schedule with whichever backup scheme we set up. The NAS itself will use Synology's 'Hyper Backup' to then back itself up to the Synology C2 cloud storage - whew... that's a lot of Synology stuff, and I rather dislike that.
 I'd rather have something less monolithic in the event Synology changes something down the road(for example pricing), forcing me to change gears. Given the above use case, what would be your go-to setup?
 Follow-up question: In my office, I too use a Synology DS, and with that I also use the Synology Office productivity suite which I would describe as 'decent, but no Google Docs'. Do you all have any luck with NextCloud with regards to a Google replacement? What type of hardware do you run?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My homelab is loud... loud enough to be heard on the first floor even though it's in the basement. It also probably accounts for 70% of the electric bill. Understandably my family looked at it as the obnoxious money-sink in the basement that could only be used for sketchy activities. However, after looping my family into three applications I self-host, the complaints have stopped and I have achieved homelab immunity! Those are:
  
Plex. Shouldn't come as a surprise to most, but having an increased catalogue of content really spices up movie nights, and with tv shows for days there's less time to complain to me.
 Zoneminder. The ability to keep track of the house while away, practically unlimited recording, and no monthly fees with an Android app sold my averagely tech savvy parents. They feel peace of mind knowing that data is not going to the cloud and is controlled by another nefarious entity instead, me.
 Bitwarden. When I told my mom she didn't have to store her passwords in an excel sheet anymore I swear I saw a glimmer in her eyes. Not only that, but the ability to safely share passwords between family members while also keeping all data in house was great for my dad who routinely unplugs our google home minis so they don't "spy on us".
  
What self-hosted applications or homelab functionality has persuaded the commoner in your life that your homelab is worth it?

 I'm trying to set MFA to only be required if not accessing from a specific subnet. So, I've created an expression policy containing the following:
 return ak_client_ip in ip_network('10.0.1.0/24') 
 Which is bound in the default-authentication-mfa-validation stage of the default-source-authentication flow. Negate result is ticked.
 However, when accessing Authentik from a client on the defined subnet, I still get prompted for MFA credentials.
 If I change the policy to:
 return ak_client_ip.is_private 
 Then, I don't get prompted for MFA. However, the point is I want MFA on some subnets and not on others.
 Anyone have any guidance?

The goal would be to avoid algorithms and provide me control over the things I consume. For example: I would like to add /r/selfhosted, youtube channels and maybe a twitter handle on the same timeline stream. A single entry point for my media consumption, where I control what I get. Features would include:
  
adding multiple different sources (twitter, reddit, youtube, filesystem, rss, etc)
 multiple timelines (news, tech, health)
 tagging items 
 sending items to third party services (send a twitter message, etc)
 multi-platform (web/android)
 I don't have to leave the app to consume the content (I can watch the youtube video, for example)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I've been putting an older 2U server together for a friend as their first starter homelab. It's on the old side, based on a Supermicro X8DT3-F with the same SAS onboard and one PCI for the extra ports, based on LSI SAS1068E (pre-2008, 3gbps). 
 I gave them 6 of the 10TB drives pulled from my own lab (upgraded from 10s to 14s on one of mine) 3 of which was an existing zfs raidz1, After booting up the system I found nothing wrong with importing the existing pool, until I went to add the 3 wiped disks to it. That was when I discovered the SAS controller had a 2.2TB limit to the drive size, even in IT mode. 
 I thought to myself "Self, you know ZFS does some fun stuff to make it function at a low level on the drives, which is why it won't work on a hardware RAID, maybe you shoud make those drives into a zpool and put them back in the system." So that is what I did, and to my surprise, the full 10TB was being addressed! I fully expected something to break fantastically when going over the 2.2TB point of any drives, so I loaded those bad boys up with as much random unedited video I could scrounge up, and filled all of them. Despite being rather slow, they survived a scrub and test play of several of the files.
 ​
 In the name of... Science (?) I figure anyone looking to get mega-old servers, or maybe those with some laying around, might find it interesting to turn practically useless hardware into backup servers of last resort, or like my friend, a somewhat slow starter lab. I would be especially interested to see if anyone successfully pulls this off to know I didn't somehow violate the laws of computing, common sense, and all that is holy. So... good luck!?

 I am aware it's not the perfect machine for a file server but I'd still like to use it as personal NAS. Sadly it does not have USB3.0, only 2.0 and it has a PCIe slot as well as an mSATA slot (which currently holds a 128GB SSD).
 Mirror RAID is absolutely mandatory for me so I am looking for a way to connect two harddrives (2x14TB).
 Is there a PCIe (or better, mSATA) to eSATA board I could use?

 Any solutions for 16tb or more for around $20usd p/month or am I dreaming?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few friends who are not interested in tech at all and I would like to find them a way to connect to my NAS , nextcloud, etc. over the internet.
 In a normal setup, I would simply host a VPN gateway in Azure or something and have everyone connect. However, there will be devices like PlayStations and phones involved, so that's not an option. Connecting directly from the router to the VPN would solve the problem, but would also route all of their traffic over my gateway, which isn't great either.
 I also don't want to expose anything in my local network.
 I know, this is a rather esoteric use case, but maybe someone here has an idea.

 ​
 As the title states, I'm able to run a Guacamole instance of this all-in-one Docker image in a test laptop whereas I'm having no luck whatsoever with my home server.
 Both systems run Fedora Silverblue, with all that it entails. 
 My docker-compose.yml describes the service as follows:
 guacamole: image: docker.io/jwetzell/guacamole:latest container_name: guacamole volumes: - ${CONFIG_DIR}/guacamole:/config:Z ports: - "${GUACAMOLE_PORT}:8080" restart: unless-stopped # privileged: true 
 Any ideas? My only guess lies in the GPU side of things (the test laptop has an oldish Intel iGPU alongside and AMD dedicated GPU whereas the home server has a 12th gen Intel iGPU with no dedicated GPU whatsoever).
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, appreciate you time. I've got some supermicro servers that I want to put SATA SSDs into, but the drive bays are 3.5inch. Obvious solution is to use adapters, this brings me to my main question. My main question being:
 ​
 It doesn't seem that anyone sells just the little metal brackets that you screw the 2.5 inch drives into that you would then screw into a 3.5 inch drive bay without including the actual tray. If you've had to solve a similar issue, how did you solve it? Cheapest I've found the bays with brackets is at 8 dollars a piece
 ​
 It seems that the cheapest way of doing it is actually to buy a used drive tray's that come with the adapter bracket, this seems wasteful because I'll never use the drive bays since I already have some and it seems like it could be done cheaper since the bay itself is certainly the most expensive part of it. 
 ​
 I found a couple of adequate STLs but I don't have a printer so I'm not sure whether I could actually get brackets for cheaper than the price of whole bays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not used to Reddit so apologies if this is the wrong place or I screw something up. 
 I have a very old hard drive (HGST Touro 1tb external drive from like ten years ago, it's been with me forever and the exterior is full of scratches from impacts that it honestly shouldn't have survived.) I use it purely to back up unimportant data since it could die any moment now.
 I'm transferring files from it onto a new drive after the previous one had to be RMA'd and I noticed something strange. When transferring one particular file, the transfer froze and so did crystaldiskinfo which I was using to monitor the new drive under load. The "read error rate" value kept decreasing (meaning the errors were going up). I figured the drive was finally dead or it was an issue with the specific sectors holding that file. Killed the transfer, started it again excluding that file. Everything started moving smoothly again. 
 However, what struck me as odd was that once I did that, the "read error rate" value reset to the default value of 100, as did the "worst" value. As if nothing had happened at all. I just checked it again and the transfer is still going, but the "read error rate" value was back down to 98, then reset itself when I refreshed crystaldiskinfo. No other utility shows an issue either. I know the drive's probably dead. but anyone have any clue why the value keeps resetting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, I'm in Brazil, so stuff which may be inexpensive elsewhere might be really inaccessible for me.
 My data is divided like this: 1.4 TB of movies and TV shows, mostly on 720p or 1080p, 375GB of copyrighted classes I ripped from places and a few GB of files that are less static than the other two sets.
 Backing up the movies and TV shows isn't really necessarily, as I could always grab them again, but I'd like to safely store what I ripped, as well as have versioned syncing for some of my user folders.
 Also, I'll visit my brother in the US by the end of the year, so I might take the opportunity to buy some hardware on black friday and set up a nice NAS to feed my Plex.
 For the backup and storage, I was wondering if I should go with Wasabi + some software (preferably with a GUI, but not strictly necessary).
 For the NAS, I believe that some setup with support for 2 HDDS, one with 4TB and one with 2TB, would meet my requirements for a very long time already. I'd be streaming mostly to my laptop, but also to smartphones and TVs from time to time, so it would be nice if it had transcoding capabilities.
 I tried reading through the wiki, but I simply felt overwhelmed by the information and decided I'd rather ask for an informed opinion, so any advice is very much appreciated!

 This afternoon after work, I threw in some memory cards I got second hand from eBay (2x 32gb DDR3 ECC 1600mhz). After researching how to I needed to install the RAM from the Dell handbook, I put the RAM in. I did it wrong a few times and it got stuck in POST loop so I held down the power button to power down. I finally got the memory stick configuration right and the server booted and appeared in my connected devices in my network. When I got to the ESXi web ui and logged in, I was missing both of my datastores. 
 more info: I looked at the drive bays and my second drive had a yellow and amber alternating light. I found the diagnostics in the manual, says it means "Predicted Drive Failure". 
 I don't know what to do or what to research, any advice?

 Whenever I try to create a new pool, this is the error I get (0 B of capacity). I choose the option on installation to format the disk, but it doesn't seem to work. I'm sorry if this is stupid, but I'm brand new to TrueNAS and have tried Googling my problem but to no avail. Any help would be appreciated.

 i have a Mikrotik CRS-305-1G-4S+IN switch.
 i factory reset it and set a static ip on my pc to 192.168.88.5. it loads in RouterOS at 192.168.88.1.
 with the ethernet cable plugged into port 0 (Eth/Boot) I select: system / routerboard / settings and set the boot to SwOS. click apply and OK and the click on reboot.
 then i can't seem to access it anymore. i've tried enabling dhcp option after boot and still nothing.
 i've tried 192.168.88.1 and 192.168.88.2 as well.
 i saw this post with the same problem but it wasn't resolved.
 https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?t=186490

 how do i put swos on it and how do i access it?

 I just want an option where I can give it a huge folder and tell it it upload and it will do that with no errors at all. I feel that is not too much to ask, is there a better piece of software to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve got a 6 bay Synology 1621xs+ that I’m moving to from a 4 bay 920+.
 I realistically only need a max of about 20-30tb, as I’m currently only using 6.6tb and that amount hasn’t changed in a while. I do full system backups and will eventually create a Plex server as well.
 My issue is: I’m trying to find the most quiet, reliable drives for my NAS, but here’s what my research shows so far…
  
from every account I’ve followed, I should stay away from Ironwolf if noise is a concern, and I can attest to that because I tested 14tb Ironwolf Pros in the past and could hear them a full floor up.
 if I want Helium I need to go 12tb or higher (and I’ve heard 10tb WD Red Plus drives can be loud)
 I shouldn’t bother with 5400 class drives because they just run at 7200rpm anyway from what I’ve read.
  
Any accounts about how 10tb WD Red Plus sound? Or 8tb? Or just opinions on which drives to look at? Thanks.

 Let's say a web app, its untouched font-end doesn't have “copyright” and “powered by”, should we add a copyright notice like "copyright the name(the project name/company name)" on the font-end on every page?
 For the back-end, I am also adding some code. For the untouched file, we just leave it as it was? Then for the new file, we can add our names as authors, correct?
 How can we achieve the State Changes requirements? Do we need to push our code to the github?

 Right now I'm using Google Address book and trying to keep track of clients in there, but it feels a little clunky. I'd love something with a design that's more like a CRM tool, but without the fee's!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have been trying to do some research on having multiple domains to my home. One for more family personal stuff and another for more professional which would probably just be Nextcloud. I currently use traefik with one domain and one host. Everything I have googled either isn’t much of a guide or just wasn’t what I was hoping to find. I also searched using HaProxy on pfsense to balance between the servers and then traefik to handle the subdomains after that but only found one thing and it was to not do it. I also looked into cloudflare tunnels but seems like it’s not really ideal. I’m not doing anything media streaming with the domain so would that still be an option?
 Is this even possible? Where can I find a guide in order to set it up if it is? I just want to be able to have more specific domains than anything. Don’t want to mix a family domain with something a client may type in. And I’d rather not set up NC with a provider because I really don’t want to set up more security for that. 
 Thanks!
 Edit: wanted to add that I’d like to separate the domains over multiple hosts. So one host per domain and of course each service getting a subdomain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a few years of running a handful of services for personal use on a duct-tape-and-spit setup of systemctl services on a once-dead family PC (only accessible via ip:port, of course), I've finally decided to take the plunge and redo everything with fresh hardware, docker compose, an actual domain name with https, etc. I currently have (just about) everything that I think I want up and running on another computer brought back from the dead (an old gaming laptop with a shot GPU), but I'm hoping to buy some dedicated hardware to improve performance, potential for future services, and -- arguably most importantly -- a system that I can actually trust to last without draining my bank account via power bills. I'd ideally like to stay below $150-200, although if there's something not too far above that I can stretch it a bit. The current services that I have dockerized and running that I'd plan to run on the new hardware are the following:
  
Adguard Home (although I could be talked into switching to PiHole, AGH just seemed easier)
 Caddy + DuckDNS (reverse proxy and domain name registration)
 Flame (Dashboard)
 Nextcloud
 Jellyfin
 Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr (might expand to other *arrs in the future, just haven't found the need yet)
 qBittorrent
 gluetun (to route some services through)
 Yacht (for managing containers, also open to suggestions for this one)
 Possibly a separate music library (maybe Navidrome? Currently running airsonic-advanced on the older server which works fine but an upgrade would be welcome)
 Possibly an image gallery separate from nextcloud (so far looking at Immich or PhotoPrism, but I'd like a way to auto-upload photos from my desktop too (possibly syncing with Nextcloud?), ideally with some level of face/object recognition, and the ability to organize things into folders myself would be nice (e.g. separate folders for photos I've taken and things saved from elsewhere))
  
Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I can't make my mind between Ds 720+ or Asustor AS6602T. As I understand they are same class NAS?
 My idea is to use 2x Seagate Exos X16 16TB, mirrored. As I understand this Seagate drives aren't on compatibility lists. I wonder if they will run well? What restrictions can appear? 
 It will be used mainly as media server with 4k transcoding. I'm completly new to this game so any advice for what I can use NAS in home for. I'm not planning to add any RAM or SSD drivers, so please advice me how they will run with stock ram and two 16TB HDD.

I see that I can download these logs up to 90 days from my personal Verizon account. However, I want a copy of all of my call and text logs that Verizon has. I already started by emailing them last month, but I haven’t heard anything back. 
 Is there a way to request this from Verizon? Has anyone tried before?

 So, I was wondering if there are any compact, low power draw, Network Attached storage devices that can attach only one, 1-2 TB m.2 or 2.5" drive to my home network so I can more easily restore and transfer files to and from the 2 PCs.
 ​
 I do not want any expandability I only want a singular drive, small size and low power draw are my key factors here.

 Long time follower of the sub, but first time poster.
 So I have been reading all about the different setups y'all have. So recently, I started to take the plunge myself and started to self-host a server.
 Now to do this I grabbed a bunch of HHD's I had lying around, but unfortunately they started to give me errors. And made working with them really difficult.
 So there lies my question: what software do you use to check your disk health (intensively) so that you know older disks will keep working for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple months ago i hit the 95% mark on my current system and started planing my new Nas. Now i am at 99,83% and still couldnt decide on a solution that will hopefully last longer :/
 Pls tell me if my ideas/requirements are stupid.
 What i want to achieve:
 - 4u Case (Rack is basically full) - so extra JBODs currently not possible
 - ATX Mainboard & PSU support
 - Not super loud (or at least modable with noctua fans)
 - At least 35 bays 3.5" - 48 would be perfect
 - Top or sideload
 - 6g backplane
 - Max 1000€ just the case, full server no drives 3500€
 My ideas so far:
  
Getting a Chenbro 40700
 Would meet basically all my requirements the only problem is availability. I have been looking on ebay & co for the past 6 months and couldnt find any (EU). Besides like one listing for 4000€
 Supermicro Super Storage
 like the SSG-540P, 6049P & 5049P
 Would be quite a lot of compromises, loud non replaceable fans in psu, mostly no atx mb or psu and only available in intel configs not epyc. But still poor to none availability.
 Intertech Case
 Super cheap (like 150€ new), no backplane, no anti vibration, Rail quality poor to a point where i wouldnt trust it holding 40+ disks. Maybe usable when heavily modified but not sure
 Storinator
 I really looked into it but just way to expensive for the components. When compared with diy and you look at the hardware costs (cpu, ram, hba, psu etc) i ended up with like 8000€ just for the case on a 10000€ server
  
Am i asking for to much?
 What are your setups, ideas, tips.
 Would be really thankful for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 First time poster but a long time lurker, I have been talking to a number of people about the state of documentation, manuals, tutorials etc. Some are amazing and really thought out, some are meh and others are just broken.
 I also find the entry to certain services to be out there for some people new to self hosting, so as someone with over decade of experience in infrastructure and has a love for doing things cheaply (it's actually harder to do it cheaper than buying a rack with $5,000 worth of kit haha) and a love for simplicity I decided to create the dummies guide to self hosting.
 Now don't think that's insulting. I love the dummies guides (check them out here) I have multiple of them myself and I love the style of them. Plain in language and simple to follow.
 Now the first one i've written assumes you have basic linux skills (creating files etc) but I am working on a docker & portainer guide soon along with a few others in the basics range.
 Today I'd like to launch with Matrix and Element.
 https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/002-matrix/
 I welcome any feedback and also looking for contributors too who are interested as I am in writing really simple guides for anyone and everyone.
 My list so far being made (some are already in draft)
  
Authentik
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 *arr groups
 Portainer
 Hugo + Umami
 Actual
 Invidious
 Vaultwarden & Bitwarden
  
I am also planning to have some business focused ones so stay tuned for those.
 Thank you all for a great community, truly be enjoyable part of my day hearing new to the hobby making great things.

 Won't let me post the aliexpress link so check the pics.
  
So I need to add more storage and I'm out of internal ports/space, but my RAID card has 2x external SFF-8644 connectors. Was thinking of getting a couple of these (the SAS version with a SFF-8643 connector) and having them sit outside. I know, its made in China, unbranded so no support, but it seems like the backplane just connects the drive ports to the SAS connector, so no controller or anything that can die. Supports 12Gbs SAS, cheap, and I'll probably replace the fan with a noctua.
 Anyone ever tried these or have any experience with these?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several files that aren't needed in a daily basis (or even a yearly basis), and it seems a waste to not burn them into optical disks (even multiple times) or even external USB disks (HDDs or SSDs). I don't want to lose what I have stored in the extenrnal disks though, because I may end up re-downloading it. Additionally, I seem to have some files in multiple disks (for reasons), or similar files that I want to reorganize. It seems I have multiple VHDs taken from various systems, for example, all strewn in multiple external USB HDDs.
 In my ideal world, somebody will have made a special file system that would keep the list of the files (maybe with some minimal extra metadata, such as checksums, thumbnails, duration etc) offline, and when you do a modifying file operation (such as moving a file from one folder to the next), the UI for the file system would ask you to insert disk A to do the writes (or maybe insert disk A and disk B so that it can move the files from one disk to the next, or insert CD A to copy the files from it and mark them as deleted, etc.). Does such a program exist? Has anyone used anything like it.
 As a second best solution, I'd like something that you just register a disk (optical or HDD/SSD) and it records what it has on it and displays within its own UI (so no actual file system). I'm pretty sure something like that exists, but my searches have been fruitless - maybe I'm not describing this correctly.
 I figured if something like this exists, this subreddit is probably the best place to ask.

 I looked at a few options:
  
Raw rsync with open firewall ports: not my favorite idea.
 Ceph: too complex for me to test on my own. Maybe there's a guide somewhere.
 Tahoe-LAFS: I spent months trying to get this to work on my own and I couldn't figure it out.
 Restic: 
  
We don't need any fancy "management" system tracking usage, and all files are encrypted before being sent, so physical security is not a concern.

 I am working on important film project for my career as a fresh and a new DIT on the market and I need your advice. I wouldn't be asking for a question here if programs like ShotPut Pro, Hedge, SilverStack or YoYotta are available to me ( production issues that are becoming my issues). To cut to the chase, technical director has offered me a program called Teracopy. I have never ever worked with with Teracopy, but I've been searching and learning about it and during that process, I've stumbled upon a few alternatives like: FastCopy, Robocopy, Kyno, Rsync, ChoEazyCopy, Roadkill Unstopable Copier, Goodsync, etc. etc.
 You get the point, so much information, so many different software, it's easy to get lost in so much information.
 Do you guys have any recommendations? Have you worked with any of those programs?
 Thank you all in advance,
 Marco.

 As you may remember from my previous posting here in this sub, I presented you Kubero: a selfhosted clone of Heroku to deploy your apps on your Kubernetes cluster. 
 Thank you for your support by staring my project ❤️ 
 I worked hard on it for the last 2 months: 
  
Released Application (v0.0.1)
 Published Operator (V0.0.70) on Operatorhub.io and Artifacthub.io 
 Added Docs (still growing)
 Deployment examples (buildpacks) with the most popular languages and frameworks (PHP, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Python, Rust ... ) 
 ...metric tons of testing and fixing
  
Kubero is still 100% nonprofit and open source. So contributions (coding or testing) and feature requests are very welcome
 I will start with the Kubero CLI (Golang) when the main Project has reached 100 ⭐ :D

 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/selfhosted, I just wanted to gather some opinions regarding removing Nextcloud from my home server and replacing it with a few other services. The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.
 I've been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:
 - SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV's transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn't deal very well with large files, but I'm not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.
 - Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.
 - Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64. 
 The goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server. Does that make any sense or is that an overly elaborate solution that will not provide any real improvement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure if I can post it here, but I am somewhat a data hoarder. I love making electronic devices teardowns and document how they work and what do they have inside.
 I am also developing an open source firmware for them, OpenBeken, so it of course helps.
 Anyway, here is my page with teardown links.
 It has just reached 100 devices - I do not brag without doing work first.
 Of course, many teardowns were submitted by OBK users and contributors, so it's a community effort.
 Our content is really unique - there is no other place dedicated to making a DETAILED teardowns of IoT devices.
 ​
 My question is.... do you like that kind of thing? Is there someone interested in just, maybe achieving our work or maybe even contributing to our IoT devices database list?
 The contribution procedure is simple. Make screenshots from shop, take photos of package, take photos of device insides (preferrably good quality), write down chip names, do a eletronic analysis if you can, do a firmware dump if you can (with UART tool ,not necessary), post it to our Elektroda forum (our reliable hosting, this forum has about 20 years history) and I will add your work to the list. Thanks.
 PS: I also do a teardowns of non-IoT devices, but that's a story for another time!

 Do I have to choose between home network vpn and paid vpn? Can I be connected to both at once?
 Lets say I want to vpn almost all the time to my home network to access shares on my network - is that a good idea? Would i have to disconnect for the times when I want to use Mullvad?

The Dockerfile and docker compose I used are below. I created symbolic links to the apps I am interested in into a single directory and mounted it to /docker/logs in the container. Thought I would share if someone else is looking for a lightweight solution to consolidate and view logs in a browser.
 Dockerfile
 FROM golang:1.16 WORKDIR /gotty COPY . /gotty RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 make FROM alpine:latest RUN apk update && \ apk upgrade && \ apk --no-cache add ca-certificates && \ apk add bash && \ apk add lnav WORKDIR /root COPY --from=0 /gotty/gotty /usr/bin/ CMD ["gotty", "-w", "-p", "6383", "lnav", "/docker/logs/*.txt"] EXPOSE 6383 
 docker compose
  gotty_lnav: hostname: gotty_lnav image: gotty:latest container_name: gotty_lnav restart: always volumes: - ${docker}:/docker ports: - '6383:6383' 
 Quick setup instructions
  
git clone https://github.com/sorenisanerd/gotty
 cd gotty
 nano Dockerfile, paste contents above, save, and exit
 docker built -t gotty:latest .
 Add the docker compose above to your docker compose file
 ls -s /path/to/app1.log /docker/logs/app1.txt (do for all apps you are interested in)
 docker compose up -d
 Launch browser and go to http://localhost:6383

But an entire iTunes backup to my server. I know that macs can sync with an iPhone over wifi and back them up without being connected via a cable. So I was wondering if there was a way where as soon as my phone connects to my home network, it triggers my Mac to backup my iPhone over the network and have it store the backup files on my server. Is then even possible? Is there a docker container that can emulate a networked Mac with iTunes for me? Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I couldn’t find anything on google.

 You need to change the default smtp port value in config.js to 587, from 25 IIRC. 
 Save, then restart service. 
 Otherwise, as of now version 1.69.167 it wont work and throw error in the logs.
 In windows it's located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Eaton\IntelligentPowerProtector\configs or wherever you installed it.
 In linux (debian for me) : usr/local/eaton/IntelligentPowerProtector/configs/
 Then need to restart the service,
 windows : eaton intelligent power protector
 debian (as root) : sudo systemctl restart Eaton-IPP
 ​
 Thought i'd put it here as well in case I get stuck again someday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 The house I’m in has pre-ran coax cable in the walls to jacks in about every room, I’m wanting to using a device called a moca converter to turn these jacks into Ethernet out puts, effectively wiring my whole house for Ethernet connectivity.
 Anyone have experience with this? Things to look out for or suggestions?
 As it stands my ISP (Spectrum) will only allows for one modem inlet on one jack, so I am thinking I’ll then tap an Ethernet cable off a switch, run it to the attic where I’ll convert from Ethernet to coax. 
 I’ll then use a coax splitter to wire into the loose cables that go to the rest of the jacks in the house.
 At each one of these jacks I’ll place another moca to get back to Ethernet and do the deeds from there.
 Anyone poke some holes in my plan?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On my servers I've had the following offers to hook me up with let's encrypt certificates:
 Nextcloud - either as part of the Snap setup, or through the proxmox turnkey Linux container.
 nginx proxy manager - they'll hook me up too.
 CloudFlare - they offer one if I proxy my traffic through them
 PfSense - I can set up let's encrypt certificates on the firewall coming into my network. 
 There could be another one too.. but that's all I remember for sure.
 What's the best practice on setting up the SSL certificates and who should you take yours from when being offered them up by everyone? I forget which one I actually chose... I think Nginx since they let me do wildcards and that way I'd only need the one certificate... But was that the best choice? 
 Two related but other issues I'm having trouble with and would appreciate any advice on are:
 I know I have HSTS turned off on my Nextcloud/Nginx proxy manager but half the time when I connect via the fqdn from inside my LAN I'll get the HSTS error. A few minutes before or after and it'll seem to be working fine. If I connect from outside the LAN it's usually no issue.. 
 When setting up the new nextcloud server, I made a test certificate. Now the production server is no longer named test, so the certificate name doesn't match the certified server. How do I go about revoking a certificate in Nginx proxy manager to issue a new one with the correct name on it?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this in r/sysadmin but was told to post here.
 I'm trying to set up OpenLDAP to mimic what is set up at work. Since I'm mirroring work, I can't use any alternatives like FreeIPA or others.
 At one point, I had an OpenLDAP server running in my homelab on a Raspberry Pi as I was trying to learn OpenLDAP setup and configuration. I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.
 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

 I've been looking for a proposal software for a startup i'm working on launching and I see all sorts of SAAS options but nothing active and self hosted. Anyone has a recommendation ?
 The only open source "options" I found seams dead like Bupros Procurement  and version 4 of invoice ninja but they removed the feature in v5.
 From what I understand the top SAAS are PandaDoc, Proposify and Prospero but I'd rather self host everything from open-source projects.
 Does anyone know of a procurement software open source project that's still running ?
 Edit: Found LibreSign since, ill try to install it and give feedback but I'm still open to suggestions.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a pretty specific, out-there request, so it's okay if no one has any idea on this sort of thing, but
 I'm looking for a self-hosted timer. Something where I can be like, "hey, in 32 hours, I should check on the thing". Preferably in the form of a docker server that can be checked from a browser? Though I guess I'd be interested to hear other alternatives even if they aren't that. Kinda like those "it's xx days until Christmas" deals, except that it doesnt have to be Christmas
 I know I can technically just download any standard ol' timer app, but
  
That's on a per-device system. If I ran the timer on my computer, I wouldn't be able to, say, check on the timers from my phone
 I'd have to keep it open. :( (first world problems, I know. admittedly, if I need to restart my computer for whatever reason, that does throw things out of wack)
  
Anyone have any ideas on what this might be?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've a couple of really old rackmount servers that have no practical use anymore.
 I mean proliant Gen1 - Athlon generation CPU.
 Was thinking of taking the tops off them, fitting a bit of clear perspex instead so you can see the internals and attaching a couple of legs to them to make "Steam punkish" type coffee tables.
 (Thought I might use scaffolding poles for the legs).
 Waste electronic folks want to charge me an unreasonable amount of money to take them away - figured I might as well do something interesting with them.
 Wondering if anyone has done something similar and if so would ya be up for sharing pictures to give me a bit of inspiration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, this is sort of a side topic, but since folks here know a lot about storage… I recently got my NAS all setup. Now I have my main PC I want to do some stuff with. 
 My PC has RAID on-board, and my main drive is two SSDs running RAID0. They perform extremely well. 
 So, I now also have TWO WD 12TB drives which I want to setup. I had one in there but I removed it and now I decided to put them both in. My dilemma is: do I stripe them or mirror them. 
 They will be used for a few things: downloading all kinds of stuff that I will keep some of, and trash some of. I’ll also be running a few virtual machines as well, and those will go on there. 
 I really know the pros and cons for each option, which is all the more reason why I’m asking here, because I’m finding it hard to decide which I’ll be happier with in the long run. I’m inclined to go mirror just in case of a failure, but the overhead is heavy for what certainly is not mission critical stuff. 
 Anyway, what would y’all do?

 I heard that Netify was a good option for self hosting, and I created a Github account and cloned a repository, but now I have no idea how to edit the cloned website
 Does anyone have any good tutorials that are in line with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a heads up to listen to your UPS when it complains.
 I bought 3 UPS from a homelabber (no idea if they are on here) several years ago.
 Replaced the batteries and all seemed well.
 A week ago the one I had under my home theatre (TV, Receiver, Xbox, etc) started randomly beeping when it had a load, but only occasionally.
 It still worked though so I just ignored it.
 Yesterday came home and my wife and daughter said they smelled burning plastic but couldn't locate source. I flipped on the TV and about 5 minutes later the UPS started popping and my shooting flames out the side.
 She went for the Fire Extinguisher and I just unplugged it from the wall and it stopped.
 So just a friendly reminder when your UPS complains, LISTEN. Can't imagine how bad this would have been if it decided to go sparky when we were not home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this has been asked a million times but I'm having some trouble figuring out the best way to do this. I remember trying rlclone at some point but I remember having to get a new token pretty much every few hours. Plus the rclone documentation doesn't seem to cover whether the uploads will be browsable, or if they are just a backup that can be restored from, or something else. (I tried all this about a year ago, I was not able to use anything I uploaded.) My ubuntu server has about 10-12tb of data in a zpool. I only have about 10/mbit upload speed, so it seems like prioritizing important directories would be the way to go. 
 I would have no problem picking a few directories for an encrypted upload monthly or bi weekly, that I could restore from if something went haywire. It does not need to be browsable, but I do need some way of identifying directory names since they will be encrypted as well to my understanding.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm attempting to backup my important rocky linux home server data with clouberry and backblaze b2, and I'm running into issues trying to give cloudberry root permissions so that it can read my entire filesystem. I'm new to this and can't help but feel like this is a novice issue, but I can't find any answers online. The cloudberry website itself addresses the issue by saying I should change the permissions on the files I want to backup, but this is my entire filesystem, I don't think that'll work without stepping on toes.
 ​
 My error (The amount of denied folders changes per run and gets much higher):
 "Dear [FirstName] [LastName],your backup plan BulkBackup COMPLETED WITH WARNINGS, please see below for more details. 
 ERROR
  
Access was denied to 103 files/folders (code: 1610)Access is denied to 103 local files/folders set for backup
  
INFORMATION
  
Files and folders were skipped: 81 (code: 1603)Skip folder: Count: 78 System and hidden files skipped: 3"
  
​
 What I've already tried:
 I've, of course, tried running the command as root "sudo cbb plan -r BulkBackup"
 I've also changed the to daemons that cloudberry uses (cloudberry-backup and cloudberry-backupWA) to use the root with the addition of this in their respective .service files:
 "[Service]
 User=root
 Group=root"
 and I've since restarted the server and all the daemons and that didn't work either.
 ​
 Thank you and sorry if this is easy and I'm just stupid!

 My question is, is there any downsides to staying with this approach forever? I did a little bit of digging into how the other approach would work and got a little scared of the port forwarding stuff and if I would be exposing a vulnerability publicly. 
 What are the security differences between the two approaches? Am I right in thinking tailscale would be safer for me if I’m not too confident about network and security related things?

I saw some things saying that smr is horrible and some saying it's completely fine, so I'm quite confused.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to by a dedicated router for my home network and I'm having trouble deciding between a pfsense home built router and a Mikrotik router. My question mostly concerns the Mikrotik. Right now I have a home server that serves a samba share for a few kodi boxes, but it also is setup to do reverse proxy with subdomains so I can access my photoprism and jellyfin programs from the internet. Basically instead of typing <ipaddress>:<port> i can type <sitename>.duckdns.org/photoprism Is this something I can accomplish with a Mikrotik router? Or would a dedicated pfsense pc be better? The only reason I haven't decided to go pfsense is because I really don't want a second pc running all day. I guess I could build a new home server that supports virtualization and just run pfsense and my other network apps that way so it would only be one pc running, but I don't really know what kinda hardware I would need to accomplish all that.

 Anyone have any recommendations on ones that do?
 Looking for something that has: 
  
USB
 3 or more bays
 Supports JBOD (backing up an internal 22TB with spare 14+4+4 drives I have laying around)
 Properly supports/passes through SMART 
  
Came across these two (Syba SY-ENC50104 and QNAP TR-004) and going by reviews they seem to fit the bill, but if just looking if anyone has anything else to recommend.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Mealie for a while now, started with the older version and migrated to v1 (?) when it looked stable.
 Enviroment is Docker in Ubuntu 22.04. Docker is up to date as is Ubuntu.
 Today when I went to log in, i received an error instead. 
  
An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. 
  
I've checked where I could. one thing that's odd is the log file in my config directory hasn't been touched since yesterday.
 I do see the following in my docker logs for this container:
  
Listening on: http://172.30.0.2:3001/ ERROR getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mealie-api at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (node:dns:109:26)
  
This repeats several times.
 Now that i check the container logs for the api, I see that it is likely the issue. it shows as unhealthy and it's container logs are full of errors.
 https://pastebin.com/H6VXkR3X
 i've removed and recreated it but i still get these errors. 
 i'm aware that I'm probably missing some info needed to help so please just let me know what else i need to provide.

Hopefully, others find this helpful, avoid problems and mistakes that I made and also discover new techniques like I did.

 A bit of background: Although miniDV is digital, it is stored in an interlaced format, opposed to the progressive format which is used for almost everything nowadays. When playing interlaced video on a normal monitor, you will experience a combing effect on moving objects. …]]></summary>

 I already have an adapter to plug them in at the same time.
 Is it as simple as using macrium/clonezilla in a partition? 
 I was also thinking of using those programs to create a disc image file and perhaps loading it onto vmware? I haven't tried that before.
 Will update as time progresses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, coming for advice. A while back I had a Ryzen 5950x more or less fall into my lap, so I decided to put a machine around it. It's on an X chipset with 64GB DDR4 and has 2x 1TB PCIe 3x4 M.2 drives. Elsewhere in the case are 6 3.5" spinners and the whole thing runs on unraid. I'm using it for two things right now: a Plex server (along with the rr's) and Minecraft server which is outward facing via reverse proxy.
 Perhaps you'd disagree, but this seems akin to a sledgehammer driving brad nails into trim wood. Given the above use case, what machine specs would you all build to? Should I just slam a GPU into this machine for use as a gaming rig, and build something new for the PLEX/Minecraft rig?
 All thoughts welcome - cheers!

 Popped in my system and was presented with a password request from the drive before entering windows. After hitting enter a few times, it says "disk locked". I got into windows where I found I couldn't initialize the drive. I tried a dos promt diskpart and it fails with an I/O error.
 After hours researching self encryption and other such stuff I'm still stuck with a useless slab of spinning rust. Seller is willing to help me but made it clear if it does not read in his synology NAS he's not going to refund me. I'm worried that because I guessed password wrong 3 times.
 Things tried:Seagate toolkit (does not see the drive)
 PSID as password: does not work.
 Swapping cables
 Updates: Apparently this is a ST12000NM001G model which is not self encrypting according to https://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/enterprise-hdd-fam/exos-x-16/en-us/docs/100845789f.pdf Is this good or bad for me? I'm more confused now than ever.Also he tells me the drive is shucked and he no longer has the enclosure - no warranty I guess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always have problems upgrading nextcloud. Something breaks and I either have to rollback or spend hours fixing it. 2 days ago I spent like 4 hours doing manual upgrades from cli because the web updater kept giving errors and wouldnt get out of maintenance mode. Then after like 5 upgrades in, I kept getting a different error about my db not being connected even though it was running and listening so I just ended up rolling back to before I started doing upgrades. Great waste of time. 
 I dont care for all the apps. I dont need a cms. Im the only one who uses the instance so a chat feature doesnt do too much for me.
 The only functionality I care about is cloud storage for my photos and videos and privileged account access. I like how theres an android app. I like how the android app has auto upload. I like having a web UI. I like having a trash can in case I want to restore something I deleted. 
 The last ~4 days I've been having issues with the android app crashing and I tried to upgrade my NC since Im on V22 but got all kinds of errors and had to rollback. 
 The other day I downloaded a different app called fireshare. I love the UI there and I love how snappy and responsive and quick it is. I uploaded an 80mb video to it while I was testign it out and the video buffered instantly. No stuttering. The same video on NC would play for 10 seconds then pause and buffer and the whole app will freeze up when I try to click play. 
 If someone took whatever engine is running that and repurposed it for cloud photo and video storage + android auto syncing then it would be perfect.
 I see a lot of people complain about nextcloud on this subreddit all the time. Im surprised someone hasnt made anything yet to replace it knowing a competitor would be well received around here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My data server has a 7*4TB MD RAID 6 array, which I'm perfectly content with, and I have no plans to change. It's 90% static files, and those that do change, I'm not concerned with snapshots too much
 However, for backing up, I've previously just rsynced to a bunch of USB drives, which is not practical, so I'm setting up a new solution. At the moment, I have still got USB drives, grouped into one big LVM, on a VM server, with a 20TB LVM-thin drive pointed at a backups VM. Little complicated, but will be very easy to expand (though I am fully aware that one dead drive will kill the backup and I will need to start again - I'll have a 3-2-1 in place soon too though)
 Anyway, looking at the backup solutions on here, there's loads of options, such as Borg and rdiff, as well as simply rsync, but I am aware that ZFS has two very useful features (I'm not well versed in ZFS though sadly!):
  
Snapshots, in case I completely bork something and don't notice until 3 backups later
 
Deduplication. I have a "staging" area for ripped Blu-ray content, and sometimes it's too much effort to rename them straight away, and it's likely they'll get caught in a backup and duplicated, which could waste lots of backup storage
 
 If I'm right, ZFS should be a solid file system choice for the backups server. My concern though is I could dedicate about 8GB of RAM to it, which is well below the suggestions I hear
 Failing all this, I guess I'll just try one of the mentioned softwares

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a rant here, but it feels so great to have people genuinely use your server outside of testing. It’s one thing to have friends access and stream for a quick test, and then another to have them genuinely use the services and recommend them to others. Makes all the work worth it imo, and it helps me learn the best ways to streamline the experience.

 Scrawler works, but, like the Dev himself told me, it is limited by Twitter's own structure, so it can only download the images from the last 1000 posts. 
 The other program I used was Twitter Media Downloader on Chrome, it worked kind well, despite some limitations in the ammount of images it can download. However, I noticed something. 
 It straight up refuses to download the posts from a specific time frame, November and December 2020, giving the message "No applicable tweets found" Other dates in the year can be downloaded without a problem, but not those 2 months. Is there any way to solve it, or recomment alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some more context: I have an external USB hard drive connected to my home server (an old laptop). On most days, the drive is only active for short bursts (either media consumption or nightly borg backups). I assume this kind of usage pattern is very common in the community.
 I've noticed that the drive never spins down by default and makes quite a bit of noise, which prompted me to look into hard drive spin down with utilities such as hdparm (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/hdparm). In my case, I changed the APM (Advanced Power Management) setting from its default value of 128 to 64 which reliably spins the drive down shortly after the burst of activity (as verified by ear and smartctl -i -n standby /dev/sdX). Great – less noise, heat, and (hopefully) power consumption! Now my question is the following:
 Do you let your idle hard drives spin down? Does spin down actually increase the longevity of the drive (with a similar usage pattern)?
 I'd be super happy to hear what other self-hosters do and if you could point me to a reliable resource for further reading. Thanks a lot in advance!
 Edit: the drive in question is a consumer WD Elements Portable (https://www.westerndigital.com/products/portable-drives/wd-elements-portable-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBU6Y0050BBK-WESN)

 I'm in the process of recreating my home server because I ran out of space. I'm taking the chance to move from my 8 disk RAID 5 array of 8TB drives to a 10 disk ZFS-Based RAIDz2 setup
 I've been planning to use 16TB drives for my new array, but then happened to catch a sale on WD 18 TB drives - so now I've got two of those. So my main array will be using 16 TB from each of those, and ignoring the left over space
 Is it possible to set up a second RAIDz1 array with the left over 2tb of each (or RAIDz2 if I can find an extra 2TB drive somewhere)? Or do I really just lose it?
 Thanks!

I figured getting an SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt or similar would be a breeze... except there isn't a simple way to do it unless I also bring in a lot of junk?
 I need SSL certs dumped into a directory, home assistant can take it from there. DNS challenge should be a piece of cake with DuckDNS. But all docker images I'm finding use nginx and require open ports I have no interest in opening (and it's kind of a PITA due to my network setup, which I don't intend to change any time soon), recommend installing stuff from random people, etc.
 I have started looking at acme.sh and there is a lot of outdated and incomplete information.
 Is this really how it is? Did I miss a trivial setup somewhere?

 My other server is a Dell PowerEdge r310, single xeon, 32gb ram, 6 NICs. Currently it's for esxi 5.5 because that's what was on it when I got it, and nothing else.
 What would you do with the r310? Does keeping esxi 5.5 limit me to what OS VMs can be installed? I did have windows server 2012 on it but decided to try to virtual 2019 on proxmox Instead. 
 Hit me with some ideas because I'm stumped as to what i should do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently become interested in creating an offline/online family tree. I know we have a gencom file for each side of the family, but I want to make it more collaborative.
 What is the best way to create a collaborative master family tree with gencom AND media like photos/videos/audio?
  
I don’t want to use a geneology online service where our data is discoverable by others and not owned by us. Another consideration is exporting and backing up the data and especially media from a site like that. We can use those sites mainly just for research purposes.
 
I was thinking about using GitHub for the gencom file since it is simple text data, not public if you don’t want, users can have specific edit permissions, merges have to be reviewed before publishing, and there is versioning history, and backs up offline
 
But gencom allows for storing links to media content. What is the safest and most cost-effective way to archive all of this data for offline and also allow users to add new sources (not remove existing ones)? I assume cloud storage with an automatic local backup, but that’s a lotttt of files….
 
 I’m sure there is already good info for the media storage question on this subreddit, but I’m not sure if there are any special considerations for genealogy. My first thought was databasing it all but I don’t want to deviate from an established standard. Please share any info that might help, thanks!

 Currently I have an old CPU HDD as a local backup drive and a new SanDisk Extreme V2 SSD I'm using as the primary drive. I'd like to make a third copy of this data to put into a safe deposit box or someplace similar.
 Would it be best to have a different brand SSD for the offsite drive? Or would it be best to buy a similar Sandisk Extreme V2 SSD?
 I wanted the offsite to be a fast SSD so updates would be quick. The Samsung T7 Touch was my first thought an offsite SSD backup drive. Appreciate advice from expert hoarders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, so I initially had used ARQ, but annoyingly and quickly basically spent $50 for nothing because on windows, it had various annoying issues but primarily, it would completely fill the destination drive to capacity, and stop working, regardless of what I tried, and their support was not able to provide any meaningful amount of help. 
 So, I recently upgraded the drive in my backup box, and figured maybe it's time to give it another shot since duplicati, while pretty nice, feels quite slow, has had some odd database issues that need a rebuild, and is also awful for going through to actually restore files from. 
 I'll only be backing up to an SFTP box since cloud storage would be too pricy for how much data I have, and I don't worry too much about versioning, though with ARQ doing real time scanning, instead of being a twice per day or whatever you like duplicati schedule, I might use it occasionally. The main use is an "oh shit" something went horribly wrong backup. 
 So, I was wondering, before I delete my backup and give it a spin, has it matured more on windows? How does it compare, or maybe there's something even better than both. Crashplan was still amazing and then got killed very soon after I used it sadly, and ARQ was the closest because of the real time scanning, but yeah, not working because it couldn't properly respect the destination size limits was a no go.

My main gripe is every time I need to upload my changes to my server it becomes a hassle. I feel there should be a much easier way to do this, especially if I need to update multiple times a day.
 My current routine:
  
Do edits on local machine, test everything on localhost
 Compile static content into hugo/public folder (hugo -D)
 Create a tar.gz of hugo/public folder (public.tar.gz)
 scp the file to my server home directory
 Extract the public.tar.gz into my static webserver directory (/opt/webserver/html)
 Redeploy my static webserver docker container
  
Is there an easier way for me to accomplish this or can I automate some of these task to be more efficient?

 As discussed in our previous post, we have a roadmap laid out for the work taking place on our project as we have received funding and now have received stage 2 of funding. In this post, we will continue discussing our progress to date.
 Back-end
 Mawthuq Software Roadmap
  
With the back-end we are making OK progress. We are a bit behind due to lack of time lately but we should be able to pick up the pace
 We are currently on working on creating API paths for each major route, most are done and partially tested to be found working.
 API paths are on postman but currently do not have in depth documentation
  
Front-end

The front-end has been design has been completed
 Next steps are developing the front-end into components
  
Naming
 With regards to naming the specific suite of project we were thinking of SafeGuard. What do you guys think of this name?

 Ive tried DigiKam, but for some reason no matter what I do it will always crash upon finding duplicates for me, which is a dealbreaker. 
 Some optional, nice to have features would be: facial recognition and or some kind of AI "meme recognition", autosort by metadata, text recognition and copy/paste (cursive supported maybe?).

Basically I have unraid running for most of my services, and love it. But I recently bought a lenovo m700 with an i3 and want to use it for a backup server as a while ago I lost everything due to wrong power cables. I just have no idea what OS to use. I've been thinking of just using unraid again, but I'd rather learn something new. That, plus the fact that any drives I plug into it will have to be external, I'm not sure where to go. Another option I was considering is casa os (I'm not that comfortable with cli and prefer gui).
 Also, what software is best for auto backing up selected shares from unraid to the lenovo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BACKGROUND: I have a paid G-Drive account of 2TB I also have about 70-100GB of videos (and growing). 40-50% of the videos are personal recorded zoom calls or something of that nature. The other 50-60% is a plethora of videos I downloaded from YouTube (using a 3rd party app) and other websites.
 The content of the videos range from fan-made music videos of popular songs, specific movie scenes and dialogue, episodes of certain TV shows, etc. Pretty much anything that I found to be of personal value to myself.
 SITUATION: I want to create shareable embedded links of the videos to paste them inside my Notion page(s), to have a place where I can quickly watch and refer to them when needed. I do not wish to upload these videos directly onto Notion.
 Problem is, that half of my video collection is technically copyrighted material. Having that inside my G-Drive and sharing it with an embedded sharelink, could have my account flagged and banned. 
 I do have a Synology NAS DS218+ which I recently purchased and have implemented G-Sync with. But I am still learning the ins and out of operating a personal NAS. And don't want to experiment with creating links to and from my NAS like that.

 Does anyone know if I'm able to swap out the 3.5in bays for 2.5in bays? This is my first rackmount server, so I'm not sure if there's some chassis restriction that I'll run into when attempting to swap them. Alternatively, does anyone happen to know if this restriction is something I could circumvent by going through a sales rep instead of the Dell website?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit,
 I have the following setup of servers: Dell PowerEdge R710 (six 3.5” bays)
 Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays) Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays)
 I have the following hard drives: 12x3TB 3.5” drives 8x300GB 2.5” drives 8x600GB 2.5” drives
 I have the 8x300gb in the R620 servers. Since there are six 3.5” bays in the R710, I can put six of the 3TB 3.5” drives there. One problem is that it has the PERC 6/I, which only supports up to 2TB. It also fails to start up at boot 90% of the time, so I want to replace it.
 That leaves me with 6x3TB and 8x600GB.
 I’ve spent some time on eBay, and I’ve found the following: 2xMX827 - This gives me 16 slots (8 per card) so I can have future expansion. These are 2.5” though, so I need another for the 3.5 drives.
 I also found 1xW814D, which is the same board I have in the R710 right now. I can buy another one and connect 6 more drives.
 That means that I will need more SAS controllers. I do not need RAID or whatever. I need to pass them through to Proxmox VE so I can do ZFS.
 The problem is that there is only one backplane power connector per server. My questions are the following:
  
How would I connect more backplanes to power per server?
 
What SAS controller can I use in PCIe that can handle these backplanes (preferably cheap, I’m a student)?
 
What are the part numbers for the cables that I need to connect the backplane to the SAS controller?
 
 Any help is extremely appreciated. Thank you in advance.

 Ordered 64 gigs of ram to double my total. I have a supermicro motherboard that can hold up to over 200 gigs of registered ECC ram, so I should be good. Searched for the part number on ebay and all was well.
 I have found that the computer hangs on system initializing when all the 8 sticks of ram are installed. Each set of 4 sticks boots up fine, it's just when all 8 are together. I also added a second CPU, but that seems to not effect both sets working or not.
 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QwGkcf/samsung-memory-m393b2g70db0yk0
 https://www.ebay.com/itm/134129405674
 Anyone see a difference between these two sets of ram?
 Thanks!

 Per the subject, how bit accurate are Usenet downloads I know sometimes there's a HASH available for comparison, and PAR2 to fill in missing blocks, but when you download the file, especially if it's in parts, how bit accurate is it compared to a torrent. Which in theory, the client verifies is bit accurate during the download and upon completion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m taking Google’s IT Support Course through Coursera and a few of the lessons talked about redundancy over the entire network; switches, routers, servers, UPCs, etc. How could I go about doing that at home to better learn from since I don’t actually have a job in IT? My modem does have 2 Ethernet ports. I’ve got 2 identical HP 1810-24G J9803A 24-port switches that they retired at work. I’ve got a Netgear AC1750 Model R6400 and can get another one for about $70. I know that I might need to tune the channels so the Wi-Fi isn’t conflicting. And I’ve almost got my DL380p gen8 built and configured like I want, I could build an identical dl380p for about $500. This is all so fascinating to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my APC 1500 decided life was to depressing and blew itself into oblivion. I have two good 80AH external batteries that was connected to it instead of the original internal batteries. It is a good way to repurpose an old unit with dead batteries and have done this many times.
 The thing is that I don't seem to get hold of another UPS in the 1500VA range so my thinking is to buy a new unit but since I have good batteries I would like to buy a UPS for use with external batteries. I have been up and down the internet but cannot find such a UPS, the ones I have found are way too big and also expensive.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have a new AP WAX630E https://www.netgear.com/business/wifi/access-points/wax630e/
 Its has a 2.5G uplink to pFsense which is great and I currently have 3 vlan's trunked to the AP.
 VLAN 1 (Default) for management and trusted devices
 - IPv4 & IPv6 work great, DHCP & RA are provided by my Netgear 6100
 -- Speed test to open speed test server on local lan gives me 1.7Gpbs if I get really close to the AP
 VLAN 10 & VLAN 11 for IoT & Guest network
 - IPv4 works (as per default vlan) great but IPv6 is pretty much broken
 -- All clients in VLAN 10 & 11 get RA & DNS just fine
 -- Internet connectivity & dns is working fine but TCP traffic is limited to around 50-60 Mbps
 --- I took a wireshark capture on my laptop and notice that IPv6 packets have a lot of TCP re-transmissions in these VLANS which I suspect is killing the performance
 ​

 Firewall rules havent been tuned yet for these vlans and allow any to any is configured, so this is not the issue, and no bandwidth control is configured (as you can see in IPv6 speedtest).
 So now I'm at a loss as what to troubleshoot next?
 I'm thinking the acceleration could be broken for IPv6 in the Netgear access point when traffic is coming from and to any of the non default vlans.
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated as what I should be looking for to solve this issue :)

 I wonder if there is a product that can be plugged to a PC with USB3 and provides multiple SATA data ports (at least 4) ? 
 The drives would be powered by something else.
 I don't need RAID, i don't expect nor will i use maximum performance.
 I am not looking for a dock or enclosure. 
 Just a plain old cable/expansion USB3 to 4x SATA data ports. USB2 would be acceptable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow hoarders. I need help and don't know where else I can ask this anymore except for reddit. Sorry if it's long I try to be as detailed as possible in case someone here spots something fishy.
 I have a 1 year old Western Digital 12TB Elements Desktop Hard Drive that I use to back up all my critical data. Had a planned backup for a 400GB file today and plugged the hard drive in. I copied and transferred the folder over and left to let it so its thing. 
 However I came back 10mins later to an error message. "Error 0x800701b1. An unexpected error is keeping you from copying this file...." For some reason my wireless mouse had failed at the same time, and my PC had hanged/lagged? I almost had to force shut down my PC. Eventually got my mouse and PC running again and tried to eject my HDD but found that in the period my PC was hanging, my hard drive had ejected itself.
 I eventually plugged in again. And then transferred the folder into the drive in chunks.
 1) Has anyone here seen anything like this before? What happened here? What should I do :(
 2) Have I lost data from my original 400gb file due to an interrupted transfer+ an improper ejection of my drive?

I'm not in the field, I've just always hosted my own stuff and it's grown over the years large chassis allowed for bigger coolers and quieter fans. used to be in a 24u rack up stairs before battery purchase/ full home hardwire now its downstairs I probably have louder systems but why buy new cases when I'm underutilizing the systems now.
 My NVR runs around 55-60% usage. The main server varies based on plex/game hosted 75-80% max

 I'd like something that can be used for VM disk storage as well as network file storage (SMB/NFS). Performance isn't particularly important because it's a home lab. 
 Extra points if you've got tips for reducing power consumption on drives. I've got some red drives, and I'd like to make sure I'm keeping the power bill low if possible.

 Currently speccing up a home lab, live in apartment so not a lot of room. 
 Ideally I’d like to go rack format, but most pc cases for 19” rack seem very deep, around 650mm?
 Would appreciate any recommendations on pc case that is shallow and not too dissimilar to depth of routers/switches. Only plan for motherboard/psu/2xssd inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I know this gets asked a lot and I've done a search which overwhelming seems to point to Moodle as the LMS of choice in the self hosted community.
 I am looking for an LMS for home use for my wife and I. Could swear I remember seeing a post within the last 6 months with recommendations other than Moodle but maybe I was dreaming as I can't find it anymore.
 So, Moodle doesn't seem to list some actual features that I am interested in (okay well it does but not all of them, or maybe it's assumed I already know). I already have Plex btw, and I really don't want to use that for online learning course material.
 The features I am looking for, in something kind of light weight are:
 - Multi user support
 - Video support (I have videos on a NAS, if I serve up an NFS directory, can I sort those videos on the LMS into the correct courses - like Plex, let me make a library)
 - File upload for course materials and PDFs etc - if PDF could be rendered in browser that'd be pretty sweet
 - But not only video streaming in a browser, but also audio stream too
 - Course completion meter and tracking (like, I've done 50% of the course etc)
 - Course tagging
 Thanks everyone! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been looking into cloudflare tunnels and trying to understand what benefits one would have by using these tunnels for access to local resources hosted in containers rather than simply reverse proxying to said services?
 For context I have about 21 containers with Traefik setup as my reverse proxy. It's configured to setup Lets Encrypt certs automatically when I create a new service, and seems to work quite well thus far.
 I also have a static public IP address, so don't need to worry about DDNS or CGNAT or anything like that.
 Just not sure if swapping to using tunnels is worth the hassle of reconfiguring how my environment is currently set up.

I'm going to fill all 5 bays with 14tb drives in raid 0 ( this would be a secondary backup so it's OK it if fails ) . Price is just to good to pass up. Anyone use one of these? It's just gonna be like my own plex server, without plex. Just a samba share across the network to my shield Pro. Pro/cons of this unit from anyone that's used one?

 I assume that if I was to share it I would get a d.c.m.a. strike on it.i wouldn't share on youtube for example.i would be more likely to share with a small group of family friends with small children. Any feedback is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 My WAF is at it's record lowes't right now, I've been working with a "temporary" setup for over 8 moths now just because i can't get myself to finish properly attaching my rack, and that is mostly because i made a mistake when choosing where to place my conduit; please bear in mind this is a cinder block location so any changes are very troublesome.
 A while ago we remodeled a small room in our home, which is kind of the man cave: it has a small shop and the "internet" side of my homelab; however, i decided it was a good idea to place a small rack the highest posible place, right above a sink, i tought "i'll just set it up and wire it up neatly, put it there, set it and forget it", however, It's been proven very difficult to finish this task (it's worth mentioning this is not my main homelab, this is just an omada setup, two ISP modems a UPS and some RPIs, so it's not something i'll be thinkering with a lot).
 The problem that i have is... it's very difficult to work or wire anything when the rack is hitting the ceiling, and on that setup i can only access the front and right side of the rack, so that is very hard.
 Can someone help me choose a better path forward? I'm thinking that i can either:
 - Overcomplicate this setup even more, putting the rack into an "arm" so I can lower the rack when i need to work on it
 - Change from a rack setup to a "wall control" (kind of like the one technotim has) on the same location
 I much rather not change the location of the setup, since I don't have much space and all of the connections are already in that spot.
 I hope that what i wrote made sense, thanks for letting me pick your brain

 I just installed a used x540-t2 10gbe NIC and its just stuck on a boot loop. won't even let me into the bios. just turns on the fans, waits a sec or two and then turns off, and just does this forever till i pull the power. 
 ​
 I've disabled the onboard NIC in the bios, and disabled booting from the network (don't remember what gigabyte calls that) but still doing it... tried it in all the pcie slots, no dice. boots just fine the second I pull it out.

Here's my question, is there a WAN balancer or WAN failover device is can feed both WANs to that does not have a delay or can switch from balance to one WAN if the other drops? Also, I would prefer it not to be a $1K device.

Previously, I have only accessed these programs through my PC. How can I allow other computers to access these media servers by connecting to my PC via Wifi?
 The setup I want is that my Arch Linux PC connects to the home network/Internet through ethernet. However, I can spin up docker containers for media server programs on my PC. Then other computers can access those programs by connecting directly to my PC (peer-to-peer might be the proper term?) via Wifi. I don't want to simply make the media servers on my PC accessible to my entire home network.
 It seems like this should be possible, but I'm not sure where to start. I would appreciate some advice. Thanks.

Currently in the process of trying to turn my simplistic homelab into something that can run multiple services, punching holes to the outside world as needed. Traditionally, ive always just directly opened the hardware up individually, but I'd like to replace that with a more modern, virtualized solution.
 Given a single machine or two, how would you:
  
Manage VMs
 Configure reverse proxying to VMs and/or other physical hosts
 Handle network traffic (eg. possibly replace a router/switch, vlans, etc)
 Auto-provision SSL certificates
 Expose portions of that network for public use under a personal domain via subdomains
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got my own domain name.
 A while ago I read a post where someone had used their own domain to use a separate email address for every service they signed up to online. So if they signed up to reddit they would use the email address reddit@mydomain.com. Then if they started getting spam to this address they would know that it was reddit who sold their data to someone else, as that's the only entity who ever knew about that address.
 I really like that idea.
 Does anyone here have any experience to set up something like the above? I'm not necessarily sure I want to selfhost this. I'm open to all options right now, but I would like an email server (either selfhosted or not) with the following features.
  
All emails sent to any.address@mydomain.com can be aggregated into the same inbox.
 I can block a specific address if necessary. So if some service sold my email address to some spammers I can simply forward all of those to the trash.
 I don't want to set up a new email every time I sign up to a new service. I want the default behavior to be that all emails sent to my domain goes to the same inbox. But this default can be overridden when necessary.
  
It's possible that this is a really bad idea for some reason I haven't thought about, but I'm happy to take any and all input and ideas.

 I'm looking for suggestions for a card with a single port that's fairly low power and can use the PCIe 3.0 speeds. 
 OR perhaps another HBA330 is the way to go? (and then I can port 4 lanes out the back to an external box at a later date) 
 OR would it be better to add some SAS expanders to the current HBA card?

 I have a nginx as a reverse proxy for all the docker containers I want to expose to the world. It is also configured to require authentication certificate from the device that tries to connect. 
 Now, everything is hunky-dory with windows and linux (and I suppose android, haven't tested it yet, but afaik shouldn't give me any grief), but how does one present the a client authentication certificate from iOS / iPad OS in Safari/Chrome/Firefox and ideally all the other applications that may require it (for example nextcloud, jellyfin) in the future. 
 I imported the root CA crt, trusted it, then imported the signed pem file with all private key+certificate+CA info (which is trusted, because CA which signed it is trusted) But browser does not ask for one when opening the website. It just says 403 Forbidden - which means that the auth certificate was not offered for the website.
 Any help is welcome, thank you in advance!

 I got a super nice heavy duty Sun Microsystems StorEdge 72" tall rack for free.
 I'd love to use it but it has threaded holes. I have been looking for a way to convert this rack to square hole. I'm also trying to figure out how many U I would end up with if I converted it.
 I can do light metalworking so it's not a big deal if I have to weld/cut/drill/modify to make something work. The trick of course is finding the right pieces to work with. Punching square holes in steel is not so easy. 
 Any ideas? I tried searching for some generic vertical rack rails but I guess my search terms are no good because all I am finding are generic server rack rails, not the actual square hole rack pieces.

Since I am not sure it is a problem with my Proxmox settings or OPNsense settings (or maybe both?), I don't know which subreditt is the best place to post this question. Hopefully someone here could point me to the right direction.
 The NAS is accessible from other VM in Proxmox, but not directly from the Proxmox host. When I try to add the CFS storage from NAS to Proxmox VE, it does not show up there. Here is a diagram I made, hope it helps explain my problem. Thanks in advance.
 The green arrows are "pingable" while red arrows are not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, i happened to check the kimsufi page and managed to snag a KS1.. Once configured it turned out to have a 2tb drive which was a nice suprise..
 So far, i've gotten Proxmox running and with some shenanigans i've got Proxmox Backup Server running as an LXC with half the disc allocated..
 I've finally figured out how to get my cloudflare domain pointing to it using OVH's reverse DNS settings..
 I've also got it running as a Netmaker egress node..
 I'm wondering what other people are using these things for?
 I already have my netmaker server running in a Digital Ocean droplet which i feel is a good fit, so not looking to move that..
 I do also have a Racknerd VPS running docker and uptime Kuma.. this was a BF deal and so is paid up for another 11 months so there's little point moving that..
 The speed is obviously slow.. 100Mb/s so i'm not sure what else to run on it that would also take advantage of the rest of the space..
 Any suggestions welcome!
 Edit : Maybe I should drop the DO droplet and move my netmaker server to that, and move uptime to my Kimsufi... the only reason i like DO for netmaker is that i can snapshot it every day to have a roll back point should i break it.. If i can find another way to back that up reliably then that could save me $7 a month..
 Edit : ok.. scupper that plan atleast initially.. i can't ping anything on my netmaker mesh from an lxc... hmm

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I’m trying to figure out what do do with cable management in my first rack. I have my switch and router on the front of the rack, and I’m not sure how to manage the cables moving from the front of the rack to the back. I’m curious what people are using for cable management along the longer axis of their rack (it seems most cable management parts are geared toward the front 19” axis). I’d love to do something more elegant than zip tying the cables to the frame, but if it comes to that, so be it.
 Also, I managed to get a R720xd, and I’m looking at 3.5” drives. If I’m gonna raid the drives, should I shell out for WD Red or comparable hardware? Or can I get away with less expensive equipment since it’ll be a raid?

 I have a bunch of disks and 2 of those 3 disk hotswap things, I would like to put them in a case that can hold both a bunch of disks and have 4 5.25 bays to put the hotswap holders.
 Preferably retailers in the UK, but make/model is more than enough. If anyone is aware of manufacturers making such old designs, I would be appreciative.

 ​
 they sent back a replacement just fine, not retail box or anything, but came with the enclosed drive and all the cables etc. the only thing is this newly replaced drive is definitely worse performance than the one its replacing. its 5400rpm, vs the 7200rpm drive that died, and im pretty sure this new drive is 256mb of cache, whereas the old one was 512mb. its also running an older firmware etc.
 ​
 sucks to get a worse drive as a replacement, and im not sure what (if any) recourse can be taken to change it. just thought it was worth mentioning here since i havent seen this particular RMA result/process posted before, at least from my searches. I am also not entirely sure this will even have any effect on my server given the harware acceleration, dual cache drives and other rando specs of the system.
 ​
 maybe i can use this in place of one of my two parity drives? since i think the lower performance wont matter as much for the parity drives right? and i can add one of the faster parity drives to the main array
 ​
 in case anyone wants to see some of the specs of the drive i got as a return

 I want to be sure they mount in the proper order because the number assigned in windows is there number of location inside my case.
 The question is: Should I plug them all into the LSI card and just fire up windows? I am thinking it will be best to plug them in one at a time with a reboot in between each one. 
 Thoughts?

 I have had my HL a little while and have 
 Vmware Vcentre Server 7.0.2.00200 installed.
 I have slightly ignored the updates due to issues with version 7.0.3 i believe.
 this seems to be the latest version : https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/192269258900635648/1033101193196609537/unknown.png?width=1440&height=490
 However i seem to have alot of i think security updates etc (see attached) there seems to be about 100 more varying from , vcsa updates such as version 70u3d.
 is there a way i can test these are safe ? or a easy way of checking ? such as a website that maybe vmware host or is it just a case of take a back up hit go and hope for the best?
 ​
 Any idea how long any of this will take ? i have a Dell R720 x1 xeon 2650 v2 (8 cores 2.4ghz) 48 gb of ram i can put more into vcsa if needs be currently it has 12 and ssd's.

 I picked up a R730xd (shoutout to /u/pandakidd81 on that) that is likely going to be a Proxmox host. I'd like to shove a graphics card in there for Plex passthrough for transcoding. I saw a few threads from a few months ago and wanted to see what some of my fellow Homelabbers have done lately with graphics cards and a R730xd, and if they did anything, if they needed extra parts, cables, what have you.
 The same goes for the other listed servers. I have that metal (two R510s, two R710s, a R320) sitting around; I'd be fine with putting a graphics card in any of those as well and just making one of those a dedicated Plex host instead. I could pick up another card like a single slot; I have a RTX 1070 (as well as a RTX 1060) around somewhere that I'd be willing to dedicate to the Plex server.
 Please share your success (and failure!) stories so I can make an informed decision. Thank you.

Problem is, the specs aren't the best and if I don't get a RAM upgrade a VM for every service isn't gonna be an option. I want to isolate them as much as possible for security purposes though. I also want the experience of setting everything up by myself, not just download a Docker image and install it, as I think that's the most fun part. What should I do? I'm currently running a proxmox and my vyos router VM on it and I thought about adding qbittorrent and nextcloud, although I will probably hit my 8GB RAM limit soon. So, what should I do?

 But now my other port forwarding rules, 80 and 443 which my reverse proxy uses are having connection issues. Often when trying to remotely access my services using port 443, I get time out issues and connection is not possible. This will always start working again just as I remove the qbittorent port forward rule in my router settings.
 Seems I can only have one of these services' ports open at the time, and never at the same time. Both services are on same device, and on the same docker network. My router port forwarding rules point to my server and the correct IP. No other service is using the torrent listening port. Any tips?
 If anyone stumbles upon this later. The fix was to disable the "dos protection" feature on my Asus router. I think the amount of udp requests created from making my torrents connectable triggered the alert on a possible dos attack. Lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was poking around on Supermicro's website and was pretty surprised to learn they make switches. Specifically this one caught my eye: SSE-G3748-SONIC. It's marketed as an OOB Management Switch - i.e. the thing you plug all the BMCs in your rack into. It's a 48 port switch with 6x 25 gig capable SFP28/SFP+ ports. Obviously there are plenty of 48 port access switches out there with 2-4 SFP+, but I haven't seen many compatible with 25 gig SFP28 (and with 6 of them!) It's only 14" deep and lists a max power draw of 150W with optics, so I assume it's probably not toooo ungodly hot and loud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, after reading a ton on here and living through a decade of my Drobo. It's time to sunset my 5D (I had a 4D before that). It's flaky and i can't even see it on my Drobo dashboard anymore. Luckily, I can still see the fie, but I know I'm on borrowed time.
 I've been actively considering a Sinology NAS or an OWC DAS answer. Since I'm likely to from from CrashPlan/Code42 to Backblaze, I need a DAS solution. Crashplan is like Drobo for my cloud backup. I'm so mad. 
 Can someone sanity check my logic/ thinking:
 I think I've settled. I'm going to get an OWC T-bday 4 with 24TB total. That should get me 18TB of storage which should last 2-4 years at least. At that point, i'll probably buy another 4bay (or get an 8 bay and effective run two 4's inside. My photo archive is' a little under 12TB today and that' most of what will be on there
 It comes configured with Raid 5, but OWC rep said RAID 4 was better for media. I'm not sure there's a big difference and I'm inclined to keep it "as it comes". 
 FWIW - I work locally and only use the external for storage and re-accessing photos over time. So performance isn't a huge issue on the volume itself. I just need to to be reliable and store my stuff with some reduncy.
 It sounds like the soft-RAID they provide will also work well. The downside is that I'll go down to single disk redundancy. My Drobo currently allows two drives to fail before i'm screwed. However, Drobo itself is a failure, so I'm not sure that's much solace. 
 Any reactions or caveats? I'm probably going to order it today if not.
 Essentially: * TBay 4 - 24TB model with enterprise drives * SoftRaid - keep as delivered with RAID 5 * Live my life.
 Am I missing anything big?

 As an example a message shows the time as 3:00 when it was actually 6:00 when the conversation took place.
 It feels like theres something up with the timezone difference between me and the way they send the data from their servers, but idk if theres a way to tick a box that says "download data with local timezone" or smthing
 Maybe its super niche but has anyone had this come up?

 Now I can finally buy equipment on my own. I've dealt with Linux systems, setting up file browsers using h5ai, running them on GCP/AWS, Jenkins, Plex before. I did these things on one of my less powerful laptop back then. 
 I've doubts only regarding hardware for now. I plan on running Plex, rocket chat - for people in my home to communicate, backup photos/videos, deploy 1-2 backends for my custom home application with probably postgresql as a DB, there would be max 4 people connected and also something like pi-hole to block ads. I plan on spending a max around ₹15000 (roughly $200) on achieving this. All help would be appreciated!

 Also, the usbs were untouched for like 10+ years. Similar time frames with other stuff too. No bit rot/corruption in any of the mentioned storages. 
 So yeah, I'm a bit confused. Those usbs and the hdd are probably over 20 years old. They have tons of pictures/videos and my mums uni assignments. We found another usb dated back at around 2009 and it also worked fine? That was 13 years ago?? 
 Also, the usbs should be on the same caliber as ssds right? (Flash) I've experienced first hand that an ssd will die out if unused for a year or so. (External storage for xbox)
 By the way, I plugged in the ide hdd through an adapter since the original iqon pc had it's power supply fail like 6 years ago. 
 The old phones (blackberry/some samsung, both 13-17 years old), still worked and I immediately backed everything up. Same with our old disposable cameras. All untouched for 10+ years.
 I didn't switch my xbox 360/wii/ps vita/ds for around 6-15 years, they all work fine?
 What's going on? This is old technology too, no ssd's.
 Is it like the old era being "built to last" (think of a giant stove/refrigerator) or were we lucky? 
 Also, are modern hdds better in it's lifespan?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I remember not long ago seeing a project here that had an easy setup to tunnel traffic coming to a VPS (or another remote server) to your home server without exposing ports, just like Cloudflare tunnels. I searched for it for a couple of hours, but I can't seem to find it, I'm sure I'm using the wrong keywords.
 Anyway, if someone can help me find it again, I'd really appreciate!
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, currently i'm looking for a time tracking software for my company for around 10 employees.
 Right now we use excel spreadsheets per employe with monthly tables and daily entries(begin, end, breaktime and monthly sum(calculated)).
 What i'm, looking for is a web based software with worktime tracking, overtime tracking and vacation management where everybody can track their working hours on a daily basis(not project based).
 Does somebody know a tool for that? It would also be nice if it was free and could be hosted on shared hosting (php)
 ​
 --------------------
 Edit:
 Right now i'm using this excel timesheet which i created a couple of years ago.

 I'll preface this by explaining that I'm not a networking "mastermind", I have a fairly good base understanding of networks and infrastructure as I worked for many years as a field IT and infrastructure technician (though this normally ends up being mainly remote end-user support, site outages, new premise technical fitting (but not planning), etc.)
 With that being said, I'm shortly moving into a new house! (Hooray!) and I'm very keen to make my new house a tech nerds' dream. The purpose of this post is to (try) and explain what loose plans I have with the hopes of either being told that I'm missing something key, or some helpful pointers and advice.

 My need is for example to be able to set that certain emails (they come from a certain sender or contain certain words in the subject, etc.) can then be managed, such as deleted or moved to other folders.
 Everything should work with IMAP. At the moment I am already using the filters feature included on gmail with which I can immediately delete certain unwanted emails or assign a tag to others, my missing need would be above all the ability to delete certain emails after a certain period of time automatically.
 All this to maintain order in my private mailbox and as a bonus for having to postpone the purchase of additional space as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I am running an old Asus AC68U router for a 2300sqft home. I have ethernet runs to most rooms. And I also have a 70' ethernet run from the main house to a detached garage. The asus is old, I'm guessing it was purchased in 2015/2016. 
 My wireless speeds are actually not bad. 30-60 on the 2.4ghz and 300+ on the 5ghz. The biggest problem is the detached garage, speeds out there are poor off of the netgear AP. 
 I have a WAC104 Netgear AP in the detached building and I seem to have trouble with it. My detached garage is the most annoying problem. I have some smart devices out there and I want to be able to control them over LAN from inside the house. But when that AP acts up, they show offline. 
 ​
 I'm debating if its worth the money to convert to an omada setup (Router, AP for detached garage, AP for house, and controller). Sounds like Omada would make managing the inside and outside AP's super simple. And if I ever wanted to add an outdoor AP (we may add a pool down the road) I could easily do so. 
 ​
 All thoughts and suggestions are appreciated. ISP recently upgraded us from DSL to Fiber. So I went from 6/.5mbps to 500/500!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Proxmox cluster of 3 HP Pro Compaq 6300 i7 SFFs is getting a bit long in the tooth and I've been looking around at some replacement options. I've been narrowing in on a couple of routes and was wondering if any of y'all could help with some questions I have in my quest.
 Option 1: Dell Optiplex SFFs
 Has anyone here gotten an Optiplex 5055 to run with ECC ram? I'd even be okay if it didn't support the ECC functionality, but just functioned. 
 Option 2: Build Supermicro based systems
 The drawback seems to be finding cases. Getting first party from Supermicro breaks the budget. The half height cases I've found on Amazon/ebay/NewEgg all seem like they are from the Bush Administration, and 2u case from iStar or Rosewill nowadays costs more than I paid for my 4U Rosewill NAS 6 years ago. I'd appreciate a case recommendation if anyone has one.

 Above is the first entry on each NAS of hundreds, groups of three a few minutes apart, each group hours apart, same on all three within a minute of same time. Nothing else has happened, Pen testing shows no external vulnerabilities, but it does eat away at my sanity. Nothing obvious is jumping out at me to reveal more details. I don't see any changes to network hardware around the start time, but since then both the switch and router have changed. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am about to set up a Synology NAS to provide storage for VMs and containers running on Proxmox. (not my first choice but what I have to work with) as well as backups etc.
 In deciding whether to use Synology Hybrid Raid (SHR) or regular RAID 5 or 6 is there anything to be aware of in relation to this sort of set up? For example, I think I read somewhere that it's not a good idea to use SHR when using the NAS as an iSCSI target (I can't find this reference again so I could be mis-remembering).
 I'm not convinced that I need what SHR provides but if there aren't issues with it I may as well use it.
 Hoping there is someone who has a similar setup who can shed some light. I posted on the Synology forums but didn't get any useful feedback.
 Thanks in advance

 I’m stepping by to ask if the UH-series from TP-Link is a good match for handling external hard drives? - it’s a USB hub.
 To put things in context: I’m a music producer. I want to extend my USB ports to something that can handle 2 HDDs and several MIDI-controllers, and maybe charging phones from time to time.
 Hope to get some good answers, either reviews of the UH-series or other recommendations for USB hubs that can handle my criteria’s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm looking to get started in a CCTV setup for my home, probably using Frigate NVR or Zoneminder. I've had a look around for a few things needed to get started (below). About $1100 for a single camera setup to get it all going for now.
 What are you recommendations here? I'm not sure 4MP cameras will be enough, i've seen some 12MP cameras around which seem pretty good. I'll keep this network completely separate from my main network, only having the interface accessible via a VLAN and no internet access (eventually doing cloud backups at some point).
 I'd rather go down the self-hosted route rather than using a pre-packaged suite.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my tentative file structure for the master backup I want to start for me and my family. I've lost too many pictures/docs to dead phones and hard drives. I want to do this right. My use case is that whenever pictures are taken on our phones, including my parents and girlfriend, it gets added to the NAS I have running in my closet. The backup will grow, but not delete anything from the NAS or cloud. But pictures on the phone can be deleted to save phone space.
 Currently, it's just a Windows plex server but it has 5tb of usable drive space. I've been hearing that Docker is the new way to do things, it would separate all the different self hosted programs I run. 
 I'm trying to decide between Nextcloud and Seafile. Every so often, I need to be able to upload a backup to a cloud like backblaze, plus an external drive that lives in a safe. I have spare externals I could rotate out, and my parents have a fire safe. What backup program would be best here?
 Any advice??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Intel has decided that ECC Memory Support is only allowed on Server Hardware, needing CPU, Chipset and Motherboard support. Given 'old' hardware is now stuff like Haswell are 10 years old now, supporting up to 32GB of DDR3-1866 Memory and even support M.2
 This hardware is more than capable of being used as a NAS. But most Boards & CPU's don't support ECC, so I'm wondering why we can't use software to mitigate a lack of ECC memory? Obviously there would be a performance hit, but when we are dealing with computers as powerful as these modern systems are, that decrease in performance is likely not significant (at least for most uses).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/ For Videos about hosting/managing stuff on Linux servers
 ​
 I am a professional who works with Linux servers on a daily basis and "hosting" different applications is the core of my job. My job is called "Site Reliability Engineering", some folks call it "DevOps". 
 Two years ago, during lockdown, I started making "DevOps From Scratch" videos to help beginners get into the field of DevOps. At that time, I was interviewing lots of candidates and many of them lacked fundamentals due to most of them focusing on these new technologies like "Cloud", "kubernetes" etc., so I was mostly focusing on those fundamentals with these videos, and how everything fits together. 
 I realize that this will be helpful to at least some new folks around here. If you are an absolute beginner, of course I would recommend you watch from the beginning, but feel free to look around and find something you are interested in. I have many videos dealing with basics of Linux, managing domains, SSL, Nginx reverse proxy, WordPress etc to name a few.
 Here is the landing page : https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/
 Direct link to the Youtube Playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxYCgfC5WpnsAg5LddfjlidAHJNqRUN14
 ​
 Please note that I did not make this to make any money and I have no prior experience making youtube videos or talking to a public channel, and English is not my native language. So, please excuse the quality of the initial videos (I believe I improved a bit in the later videos though :) ) 
 Note: If you see any ads in the video, I did not enable it, it's probably YouTube forcing it on the videos, I encourage you to use an adblocker to watch these videos.

 ​
 I would like to connect the nas to my three windows pcs (to the file explorer) and to my iphone. I want to be able to access it outside my home network too.
 This is the first time ever that I'm building a Nas or something similar. I'm also not really familliar with linux yet. What will be the best OS for me? And do you have some reccomendations for hardware upgrades?
 Edit: I'd also like it to be (preferred) free or if it is really much better, under €15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I find myself managing a dozen low resource vps servers in which I run a pyton script inside a screen and 2 docker containers each.
 The problem is that I often find myself having to stop/start a docker container or manually change/restart the script in the screen, and doing it for every machine (or part of them) is a pain.
 In my head i imagined a panel that would allow me to select multiple vps from a list and launch commands via SSH which would be saved via some sort of custom buttons, it would also be nice to be able to see the output of the commands in the various vps.
 There is probably no such thing, but it doesn't hurt to try :)
 Also i'm open to better suggestions, however the restart/replacement of containers and scripts is dictated by "needs from above" so it cannot be delegated to anything 100% automatic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a curiosity question only. I am retired and have an almost zero need to be able to access my HomeLab outside of my apartment. In such a case, intra-network speeds play a part in the HomeLab experience. How much speed is too little?
 Background: I live in an apartment with a Wi-Fi only environment. I do not have Ethernet lines existent other than lines I choose to run within the apartment. Part of the environment Wi-Fi is WPA2-enterprise and I have absolutely no control whatsoever over the characteristics. I have a 31 dBm signal drop between the WAP and my back bedroom where my HomeLab resides. Currently, I connect to the WAP (wifi5, max 40MHz bandwidth channels) using a GL-iNet AX1800 FLINT (wifi6, configured as a repeater to Ethernet). I have two AV2000 PowerLine adapters which connect back to my HomeLab through the wiring in the apartment (this is a trunk line between two managed switches; the line is very noisy and I have experienced a max of 350Mbps (over a 7 foot distance); down from ~935Mbps using long Ethernet cables only - iperf, measured using two RPi 4Bs on either end). The current speed of this one line is 80Mbps down/64Mbps up. All other Ethernet cables in my HomeLab connected to active devices are at 1Gbps, except two RPi 2Bs which deliver 100Mbps. I mostly use my HomeLab for RPi experiments in conjunction with a VM/LXC Proxmox server.
 So just for grins and snickers, do you think a single line at 80Mbps/64Mbps is intolerable, or adequate? What do you consider a minimum speed for intra-HomeLab connections?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm living at my parents house and started to build a small homelab to test stuff (got a power-efficient mini-pc and currently work my way to a nas).
 I got a small corner in the basement under the stairs next to the "entry point" of our internet. This is where I put the mini-pc and want to put the nas. The problem is that my main pc is on the third floor.
 Back in the day when the house got built my dad only installed cat5(e?) utp that uses all 4 pairs (so he says and by my research this exists) to transmit 100Mbit down to the basement. While it works, I don't want to connect my nas to 100Mbit and would like to somehow get this to 1Gbit.
 The cables are built into the concrete and can't be removed and my dad doesn't want to spend any time/money on that because "we only have 50mbit download, so 100mbit is good enough".
 I know that there are RJ45 Y Splitter that use two 100Mbit 2pair cables to basically make 1Gbit. Is there any chance to make this work with 2 100Mbit 4 pair? I could probably use the Ethernet port in the room next to me, which would mean that the runs are probably not next to each other.
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering making some kind of time capsule of some of my digital photos and videos. I'd like it to be something like a "permanent backup": I write the data once, put it on a shelf and then read multiple times later without the ability to accidentally overwrite the data.
 Are there any common storage devices that offer such functionality? The only ones I know of are write-once CD and DVD drives, CD-R, DVD-R and possibly their +R variants. Are there any other options?
 I could use write-protection features of various file systems and simply store stuff on a hard drive, but it seems like there's no way to prevent formatting the drive and flashing a new empty file system. However, I'd like to have a storage medium that physically can't be formatted or overwritten after the initial write. Is there anything like this that's fairly common and not too exotic?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run non-profit web/email hosting for about 50 or so domains with 1-5 users each, and I’d like to centralize authentication for the whole lot. Nginx, apache, mariadb, dovecot, postfix, proftpd, servers (win/linux), you know — all. Right now it’s a bit everywhere.
 I’ve thought a lot about it, and I think I want to run Samba AD at the center, with federation to Authentik. That should, I think, give maximum options to connect users, servers and services. Except for usernames, and maybe this is an oversight on my part.
 Since I want my users to login with them@theirdomain.tld, shouldn’t that also be their userPrincipalName? Or can I just use the email-field? Or would that require me to spin up a Samba for each domain and have a forest? Ideally, each domain with its users would just be in an OU each.
 Once that is done, I can hook up all services, either via LDAP, Oauth2, or whatever is supported by each service.
 How do other big and small hosts out there do?

Now I want to have each file or set of files in a separate IA item with proper metadata and description in order for it to be easier to access in a search. I've learned to use their cli (python) and specifically the ia copy command (could use move but will delete only after all is sorted out) but I can't seem to find out how to use with wildcards or a subdirectory (or even a full mirror of an item for that matter). Can not this be done with this command? (i can probably duct-tape some solution with list files and paths but that'd be a bit inneficient; I also don't want to download it all to upload them again individually, not now after seeing how fast a copy or move is).

There is around 10TiB free between the 6th and 8th partition according to Cockpit UI but I need to add 1TiB to the first partition.
 Is this going to be possible since the free space is not next to the partition I am trying to expand? I see a lot of talk about Cockpit UI and managing volume groups but mine do not seem to have the options (I assumed it was because I was using Ubuntu and not CentOS/Fedora.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, that is it. After getting my 8th hard drive, I finally feel like trying MergerFS. My current setup is just a mess, I mount all 8 drives as different devices, different SMB shares. That is getting out of hand.
 I installed the MergerFS plug-in for OpenMediavault (my server's operating system), selected all my drives (except the system drive and the backup drive) and let it do it's thing.
 In no time, I got a single volume mounted with all my previous data! That is... awesome! No need to search all the drives to find a single file anymore!
 Questions:
  
Say I buy new drives. Can I just add them to the virtual disk? Or will I have to recreate it from scratch?
 Say I remove a disk, or one of them fails. Will that corrupt all my files, like RAID does? If not, what happens, and what can I do in this situation?
 Will that meaningfully increase resource consumption or Disk I/O?

 I am looking for Self-Hosted system which will allow me to track inventory using BOM (Build Of Materials). 
 System that will allow me to create item and mark BOM for these items. For example : 1 BOX contains 6 bottles, that means when i issue that BOX out, system will automatically deduct 6 bottles OUT as BOM material. 
 As another example, let's tay LEGO set of 10 pieces. All these pieces are BOM items which makes 1 SET. Change that 1 SET stock from + or - i would like that system know if SET is full (all BOM items are in stock)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Y'all. I've never doone RAID arrays, proper backups, or the like before and was looing for some advice. I've currently got a couple 4TB drives in RAID1 on OpenMediaVault, but it's filling up fast. After some research, I was planning on making an offsite NAS for redundancy.
 I figured a RAID6 of like 16TB each Seagate Exos drives would be okay for offsite redundancy, it has two drives that can fail, and can hold a lot of data on a smaller number of drives (was going to start with four, and possibly go to as many as six, depending on my usage. Since it's offsite, I wanted it to be as low-maintenance as possible)
 I was then going to set up my home NAS in a raid 5 of some smaller size also on OMV (6TB a drive, for example.) I figure it's less safe, but will still have a drive failure supported, as well as faster reads for the same amount of storage as compared to a larger drive.
 With the offsite redundancy, I'm not sure if that would count as a backup, or if I should have a tertiary option somewhere. I've only ever done cold storage for single disk backups, I'm not sure how that would work with say 25+TB of data.
 Is my proposed implementation stable? Are there any things I've overengineered, or should do differently within the limitations of only having 8 bays in my local system? I don't plan on filling them all at once, I figured the 3 drives minimum for a raid 5 and 4 minimum of a raid six should hold me over for maybe a year, unless it's better to create the max size array at once, to cut down on syncing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've acquired a Synology NAS which is leaps and bounds better than the Seagate Personal Cloud I've had for a while, especially so because the thing is actually supported (unlike the Seagate).
 In my attempts to move the data across, I have both the Seagate and Synology on the network, and on my computer I can see each of them as a network drive in the file explorer. I've essentially highlighted all the folders on the Seagate and copy/pasted them over to the Synology through the network folders, but what I've now realised is this is taking the data from the Seagate and sending it through my computer, which then passes it to the Synology - not exactly the most efficient way of doing things and is taking its sweet time.
 I don't suppose there's a way to do this in a more direct manner, through the interfaces of each NAS instead so that they can just talk to one another directly on the network rather than using the computer as an intermediary? I did have a look around, but couldn't find a solution. I also don't have the option to connect them to each other via USB as the Seagate does not support this.
 Thanks in advance.

 My background is in Software Engineering, I took a Cisco class in High School, and was always intimidated by networking. Felt like magic!

 Recently, I tried to deploy another PiHole instance in the K8s cluster, and I got it (mostly) working, but external IPv6 could not be resolved from within the PiHole container. I spent a whole weekend trying to fix it. So I rage quit, used my Synology NAS to create a virtual Ubuntu Server, and installed PiHole. That process was so smooth, an…]]></summary>

The pool is permanently connected as NAS in a network and it's only used when torrenting and/or playing films. So I don't know what's the best strategy to balance long term hardware and money (by maybe selling HD). SMART summary: * 1 HD without raw read errors relatively new. * 4 HD without raw read errors but maybe getting old. * 1 HD with raw read errors but SMART still OK. Self-test passed without errors too. Same age than previous 4.
 I have freshly new 2x10TB and I don't know which pair of HD to choose to replace in the pool. * Replace the pair where the HD with errors is or leave it until it dies if it does? Sell the other one second hand? Sell both in eBay with the SMART warning? * Replace 2 normal ones and sell them? Keep error one? * Maybe replace 2 normal ones, replace the error one when it breaks in the future and sell only 1?
 Help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am assuming that mechanical HDDs are simply impossible due to the operating environment, and I'm limited to SSDs. Obviously it won't be that hot most of the time, but if my vehicle is getting direct sun exposure all day in the summer, I can't have things crash. My Pepwave routers (formerly ubr lte, now br2 max pro) handle the conditions fine.
 So then the game is about finding the cheapest SSDs. Ruling out the stuff the stuff that's obviously fraud, the best deal seems to be 2.5" NVME U.2 drives, with several 7.68 tb models in the $400 range.
 From what I can tell, u.2 and m.2 are electronically compatible, and you "simply" need the appropriate cabling / adapters to go between the two. So rather than run some massive (and power hungry) server which natively runs u.2 drives, I can put the drives in dumb enclosures, get some U2 to M2 adapters, and connect them to something like the QNAP m.2 "nasbook" with the adapters.
 This would get me 32TB of SSD storage right around $2000, with a device that I can power directly off my DC electrical system. Am I missing anything? Is there a better / cheaper way to accomplish this?
 No, I don't care about performance - not in any meaningful sense. As long as I can get 100 megabytes per second I'll be fine - no plans for anything faster than gbe. It's all about reliability in a hot moving vehicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys; I don't know much about syncing / storage solutions, pretty beginner here and after searching on the web i'm a little confused. I use apple devices (macbook air, m1 mini, iphone ) for work and i want to get rid of icloud as it always end up syncing all my files to the limit on my macbook so it's barely usable. And i'm tired of combining Gdrive and icloud for over 30$ a month, which will probably become even more expansive the more projects i work on in the long term. I am looking for cheaper alternatives. I just stumbled across syncthing, and looks great but i want to validate what i need.
 Basically; i need to be able to:
  
Access all my files from 3 ios / mac os devices.
 If i modify a file; have the modification sync everywhere quite fast for working on the go.
 If i rename/move a file; have it renamed everywhere fast and not corrupt/create duplicates.
 Being able to put a sync limit, or only sync specific folders. For example if my mac 1 TB is full; not try and clog all my storage space on macbook air 256GB like icloud does. 
 \*Bonus Have backup or previous save states for files.*
 \*Bonus Ability to share folders / files with clients directly.*
 \*Bonus Custom themes/branding options for some folders. Although i could use Notion or a similar app for that.*
  
What apps / technical requirements/knowledge do you recommand to get such system running? Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got two identical Seagate Barracuda ST1000DM003-1ER162 internal hard drives. They were bought together, and now I'm worried that they're going to die together as well. I took a look at the SMART info today and it got me concerned. I have backups of everything on both of them and my OS is installed on an SSD so I wouldn't lose any data if they did die, but of course I want to extend their life as much as possible. Hard drives don't grow on trees. 
 The drives are pretty old, the temperatures are okay and I do not have older SMART data to compare and see if the number of uncorrect/able and pending sectors is increasing or not. Here's the SMART info for both of them:
 Disk 1
 Disk 2
 There was also a bunch of errors:
 Errors
 I am also very concerned about all the "prefailure warning" flags NOT on the attributes marked as problematic. 
 But oddly, with all this wrong, I still get the following message:
  
=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION === 
 SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
  
So, my questions to you fine people are: 
  
I know there's a big margin of error, but how long should I expect these drives to last? 
 Why does SMART say "passed" with all those errors? 
 What immediate action would you take in my shoes? I'd like to avoid replacing them but if the risk is too big, that's what I'll have to do.
  
Please and thank you for your time.

 At this point, I'm suspecting it's a system board failure but I'm really hoping it isn't.
 Tried swapping power cables, PSU, Power Plug, Fans, RAM and CPU to no avail.

(free vpns are usually not recommended but thats when talking about personal vpn for you when you search for stuff not for hosting). and can i do the same for gaming server or that would have too much latency? oh and for something like ipfs i would set up something like linode node?
 or i dont really have to care? i just felt like i should cuz when i searched my geolocation using my ip address it was accurate enough to tell my zipcode and the location it guessed was pretty close
 edit: do you think pure vps might be a better option for a website?
 edit2: also srsly, should i even care if others know my ip?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my humble garage homelab featuring:
  
a synology single bay NAS
 
a hard working little raspberry pi with an SSD for speed running Plex, pihole, grafana/Prometheus, octoprint, and the TPLink Omada controller. 
 
vnopn micro running OpenWRT as the internet firewall/gateway. I have AT&T 2 Gbps fiber, and pfsense and opnsense would for some reason really throttle things. 
 
TP-Link 2.5GbE PoE Omada switch as the backbone to everything including 2 EAP 660HD access points. I replaced the stock fans with noctuas so it doesn’t wake up the cockroaches in the garage. 
 
 There’s also a UPS! 
 I dropped cables without a patch panel and just terminated and plugged them into a switch, so people on Reddit can note and tell me about this transgression. 
 Happy to answer any questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, Im damned near at my wits end here. Regularly, my internet speed drops to dial up speeds. Think a few days a week. In the past week I have had 2 days where I was able to watch youtube, download things without issue. Just now I unplugged the supplied modem/router thing and the inline poe injector. Speeds jumped from .04mbs down to 25mbs down. The more speed tests I have done the more the speed has dropped and In the time I have wrote this post I am back down to 6mbs or so. Is there anything I can do, hardware wise to fix this issue before I start losing hair. Switching isps is not possible. The one I use is the only one to offer a unlimited plan in my area. Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a server that has ssh, http and https facing the web, serving as a sftp NAS+web server. I've fended off a fair share of ssh brute force attempts, but what's nagging me is actually the web side. There is a single connection that's just constantly there, nethogs describes the connection as <server ip>:443-<some ip>:<some port> so it must be someone connected to or attempting to connect to my web server, yet looking both at /var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log doesn't give any info. The connection bandwidth is tx: 0.2~0.4KB/s, rx:1~3KB/s (both sometimes spikes to 5)
 It's seemingly not attempting neither a login nor a resource load. It's not logged in yet it's not failing any attempts. The destination IP seems to be different day by day, and sometimes it's established on port 80 instead of 443. What could this be? Surely certbot doesn't need a constant back-and-forth?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a media server in my basement; the problem is I didn't want to drill a hole in the floor and wire a 50-foot cat6 across my house to connect it to the network. After doing a little research online and consulting some local Bestbuy guys, I was suggested to use a mesh wifi system to extend the range of my router, so I picked up an eero 6 to do this.
 The only issue is that its speeds are up to 500mbps, and I have AT&T fiber, so my average speeds are up to 1gbps. The server will be at the other end of the house in the basement from the router (the house is about 1000sqft), and I'm afraid that connecting the mesh to my router and then placing one of the eero nodes in the basement to directly connect to the NAS will drop my speeds considerably. Is this a legitimate concern to have? If I absolutely must, I can wire it with ethernet to the ISP-provided router.

 I wanted to know how do you plan for disaster recovery on your home servers.
 Filesystems are easy to backup to an external disk, and it is not hard to send the data to S3 or rsync to another server on a friend's home.
 But I was thinking about databases and so on. Do you have some kind of WAL logs, follower replicas and so on?
 I am curious about your experiences.
 (Lighting candles to some deity to ask for the longevity of the hard disks doesn't seem to work well enough)

 I created a VM and wanted to duplicate the setup I had on the RockPro: basically a series of Docker containers (a personal start page, website, etc) behind a Traefik container. However, I cannot seem to access any of my docker services from their domain name (e.g., start.mywebsite.com).
 My VM is connected to the internet (I can SSH and ping google.com). My Docker logs don't seem to report any errors. It appears Letsencrypt has valid certificates. So I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. My hunch is some proxmox networking setting. Any help is much appreciated!

 Essentially the current workflow (unchangable) is that you have to fill out a paper form. I'd like to make this a bit easier for everyone by:
  
Uploading the paper PDF
 Selecting the fillable components
 Using those to build a form 
  
Then the end user would be able to:
  
Fill out the web form (and possibly cache fields)
 Receive a completed PDF via email.
  
I've found an number of PDF manipulation components out there but no "package" that has even a majority of these items rolled in to one. I'm hoping the community may be able to provide some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been blessed by an acquaintance of mine with a 4 blade/node server. I had experience with running a 2U server already but with this new one being 4 nodes I want to look into booting them over PXE. I have looked through many guides and they all seem to say similar things, but I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a concrete answer to if someone with experience can help with PXE.
 So with it being 4 nodes I don't want to use 4 different bays just to boot each of them up, I plan on using them for different use cases (a next cloud, and other hosted web-services) and my biggest question is if PXE is a suitable solution for this.
 It seems like PXE is really meant to only boot up installation media to install onto a local disk, so does that mean it isn't really for my use case, since I'm trying to avoid allocating 4 bays just for each node's boot drive. I have heard of iPXE which then uses ISCSI or NFS for persistant user data, which seems to be what I want, but I'm not looking for each node to boot the same files as they will have completely different use cases.
 Anyway, my main question is this, I want to be able to boot all 4 nodes up and each node just running like a standalone server that each has their own web-services to host, all while booting from a PXE server so that I don't have to have a local disk for each of the 4 nodes. I am not looking for someone to explain how to set it all up, I just want to know if PXE booting can do this for me or if I'm sort of barking up the wrong tree and should be looking at a different method entirely.

 I just purchased 2 disk shelves (SYS-937R-E2JB), one with a compute module and I've never had something like this. I currently have 2 x R620s that I want to turn into a Proxmox Cluster. 
 My current plan is to use the compute module on this to install something like TrueNAs, put a 10 gig NIC inside, and have it act as the shared storage for the proxmox HA cluster. Will this work? 
 My second question is how best to set things up as it's another area I'm very noobish with. If I go with TrueNAS, I assume I can setup multiple disk pools/file systems? I've got two primary goals:
  
High speed disk storage for my VMs (only a dozen or so, but I'm impatient, so fast disk IO would be nice). I'd love to be able to clone an ubuntu template in a matter of minutes. 
 Raw storage for my media library and other personal documents (with the appropriate backups in place). Current storage usage is around 18 TB on Unraid. 
  
With the above in mind, I was thinking about trying ZFS in a mirrored config (raid 10 equivalent) for the VM disk storage, and maybe another pool that is made up of raidz2 for the media? 
 I could also try something like ceph or gluster with the 2 x R620s, and just put 6 x SAS drives in each one...that would eliminate the need for a high performance raid in the disk shelf. My goal is a redundant cluster as I want to start self hosting some important things and would prefer to avoid the risk of downtime etc. 
 ​
 At this point I'd appreciate any general suggestions/advice. I'm not even sure if I can do what I'm thinking, and if I can do it, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. I did some reading up yesterday on trying to implement high IO ZFS for VM storage and it got over my head pretty quickly.

I have 8 or so Raspberry Pi 4's that are PoE powered. I'm experimenting heavily with orchestration in my lab. The lack of a CLI really makes it difficult to script switch-level changes easily. If it weren't for the fact that I can't really script against the GS324TP I'd probably buy a second one.
 My ideal solution:
  
Has POE.
 Has a web interface for when I need it.
 Has a CLI a really good means of faking by wrapping HTTP calls to a CLI interface for scripting purposes.
 Massive bonus points if it's easy to swap out the OEM fans with ultra quiet Noctua fans!
  
I don't think I'm ready for a Cisco or Juniper. I mainly want the CLI so I can bind some ports to specific VLANs on the fly.

 HP 800 g2 i5 6500 non "T" so 65W as I remember
 My fan under HDD bay (rear fan as 901 error code mentions) is loud as heck. 
 I simply cannot find option to tune this to normal speed (volume), nor option to simply unplug it (901 error during POST and enter to continue - no option for a leave-me-alone Homelab setup)
 Did you guys managed to workaround? I can even agree to leave this one but with reasonable voltage/PWM curve as now it's driving me crazy even with basic setup.
 I know that for other models some of you figured how to short some pins to bypass this check and this could be an option too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year I published the first beta release of YT-RED, originally written for downloading media from Youtube and Reddit.
 I received a lot of great feedback from r/software including a couple great suggestions for improving the overall program. I am very thankful, and happy to say that some great enhancements have been made over the last 5 months.
 YT-RED v1.0.2.0 Beta is now available
 Included in the update is a major overhaul of the UI, reducing the original 2-tab design to a single tab (suggested by u/Kendjin) that supports downloads from Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo and more.
 Another neat feature included in the update is automatic ID3 tagging for audio downloads, including thumbnail images (requested by u/asifaqeel50)
 YT-RED is and will always remain Ad-Free and Completely Free to use with no tracking or data-collection, and public source-code on GitHub.
 For a full list of features and fine details
 View the YT-RED Project Page on github.io or check out the Beta Code in the Source Repository
 Please Note - YT-RED is not an open-source project While YT-RED source-code is made public and uses several open-source libraries and resources, I unfortunately cannot label it as "open-source" as it uses paid-license WinForms controls by DevExpress. While anybody is free to download the source code, it will not build without a valid DevExpress WinForms license.
 If anyone has read this disclaimer and still has an interest in contributing to the project, I'll be more than happy to work with you.
 Thank you all so much for your support earlier this year. Please feel free to leave any questions or feedback in the comments.

 Basically, the intel build has a lower power consumption of at least 10W on all test.

 Hopefully someone here will be able to point me in the right direction, because I'm currently at my wit's end. I'm running a jellyfin media server on my nas, and I can only seem to make it accessible on my home network, no matter what configuration changes I make, and at this point I'm out of ideas.
 I have a domain registered through Cloudflare pointing at my home IP address, a WebStation portal for that domain pointing to the correct port, and another one just for that port. It's accessible just fine on my home LAN, either through [hostname].local:[port] or through Synology QuickConnect, but if I try to connect through my domain, it just displays the standard "Your website is not set up yet" splash page that it usually shows when webstation isn't set up properly, and if I try to use QuickConnect, it just won't connect at all. I have port forwarding set up on my router for the relevant port, and I plan to eventually set up ssl for the jellyfin instance, but for now I just want it to connect at all.
 I don't have much experience with networking (I started and didn't finish a CS degree) and I'm frankly all out of ideas. I'm really hoping someone here has had similar problems in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey /r/homelab
 My lab consists of a 1U server colocated in a local datacenter. It has a ton of CPU, RAM, and Storage for me and my friends to play around with. I've been running XCP-NG on it for years now. Looking to replace the server soon and may change hypervisors. I've run ESXi before but have not dived too deep into it. Does ESXi have these features or some equivalent?
  
Can vCenter manage the host behind a virtual network? Some background, the server only has 1 physical uplink that grabs my one IP. This IP goes straight into pfSense so the host itself has no physical network access. Because of this, I have to configure Xen Orchestra to manage the host via virtual adapters.
 Does vCenter offer "resource groups"? Xen Orchestra allows you to create Resource Sets. These are set limits on CPU/RAM/Storage that I can assign to a user or user group. This is great for allowing friends to play on my server without touching my stuff. I create a resource group, give them some resources, and they can then login into Xen Orchestra and create/modify/remove VMs at their will. They can't go over their resource limits, and they can't see or modify my VMs at all.

 I have 8 500gb samsung nvme sitting in a box unused, and am looking for some way to use them.
 I currently have more then enough slow storage on disks in a nas so I don't really need any more data stores, but am interested in high performance projects.
 Was looking at a nvme nas but they're very expensive, was also looking at risers? 
 Anyone have any interesting ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 Cal.com is a appointment booking tool that can tie into a CalDAV calendar. When you create a booking page on Cal.com, other people can use the page to make an appointment with you, and a new event will be added to a CalDAV calendar you specify. In fact, Cal.com can integrate with multiple calendars to help you let people book appointments while avoiding conflicts. Handy!
 However, there are some calendars I would like Cal.com to use for conflict avoidance that are published as .ics URLs only. And right now Cal.com can't subscribe to .ics feeds.
 My first attempt was to use my Nextcloud instance to subscribe to the .ics feed, then have Cal.com access my Nextcloud calendars via CalDAV. Unfortunately, Cal.com can only see CalDAV calendars that live directly in my Nextcloud instead of the .ics feed it subscribes to.
 Is there another intermediary CalDAV server that can subscribe to .ics feeds and exposes them as a read-only CalDAV calendars so that Cal.com can see them? Of course, the CalDAV server needs to refresh the .ics subscriptions frequently to reflect the latest updates.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey gang. For the past 8 years my main desktop computer / plex server has been a self built hackintosh (i5 4460, ~40TB JBOD). It's served me loyally, but I have a new remote work job, and it's time for an upgrade. I recently ordered a new Mac studio that will serve as my new mothership for work and all my personal/important files... but I still want to repurpose this old rig as a standalone plex server (and possible blue iris backup) since the hardware is still solid and the processor supports quicksync for hw transcoding (I'll probably upgrade the ram, psu, and move from sata cards to HBA, but i digress...) Here's my conundrum though.
 Part of me really wants to transition from this shameful jbod array with ~36TB of media to a more modern and manageable Unraid setup... however I'd have to ditch my cloud backup. B2 storage for this amount of stuff is prohibitively expensive for just a plex server. However, if I stay jbod on a standard desktop operating system (macos/windows/linux) I can keep all my data backed up on backblaze's desktop plan for 7 bucks a month. 
 Do I really need a cloud backup for this media? There's nothing I couldn't probably find on usenet if I had a major failure. Am I overthinking this? 
 Please help me see reason and figure out what to do. I've been going back and forth all week. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a home server that I use for the usual stuff. Due to life reasons I will only have mobile internet for about a year going forward.
 I just realized that this comes with a bunch of unforeseen issues. My mobile internet provider blocks all incoming connections before it even reaches my router, so I'm unable to port forward or connect to my server from the outside.
 For the past day I've been looking into solutions for this. My plan is to pay for a cheap VPS, and have my home server establish a tunnel to this, and let the VPS forward all traffic through the tunnel to my home server.
 At first, it seemed like a reverse SSH tunnel was what I was looking for. But reading up on it, SSH tunnels only seem to support TCP. While I found some workarounds this seems to complicate things unnecessarily.
 After some more research I found rathole which seems to do exactly what I need.
 Does anyone have any experience with this?
 Ideally I would like to use rathole to forward traffic from the VPS to my home server in order to establish a VPN connection through wireguard.
 This seems to be the right tool for the job. Is there anything I'm missing here?
 Also, does anyone know of a good cheap VPS that's suitable for this?

 Over time, it gathered more than 12000 changes across big and small Czech news sitest and article has been written about it's findings (but also in Czech).
 It's open-source and simple to deploy, if you find it interesting, you can take a look at the original version: headline.beta.nolog.cz And you can also change the monitored media and run it yourself, just edit the data/config.yaml and run it with docker-compose. 
 It crawls the declared RSS feeds, stores all the data in redis and compares it to previous crawls. If it finds a change, it's written to sqlite3 database and presented with python-flask in a simple UI.
 Have fun!

 My name is Floris Breggeman, and last year I did a survey on self-hosting to aid in my master thesis. Given the overwhelmingly positive response, especially to the results post, I decided to make this a yearly thing. This year I have no academic purpose anymore, I'm just doing it to satisfy my own, and hopefully your curiosity.
 The survey can be found here. I have updated the survey a bit compared to last years; I have accounted better for the possibility of virtualisation and asked more detailed hardware questions. The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.
 Of course, results will be posted back to this subreddit. Given that I no longer have any academic constraints, I should be able to post more detailed results than last year, and hopefully somewhat faster ;)
 I have already communicated with the moderators and gotten permission for this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but:
 So, I got into hobby photography last year, and I'm currently in possession of nearly 2TB of RAW files.
 I was recently thinking about backup strategy for my pictures, and was thinking about if I should keep all, or be selective? 
 Currently my workflow is that I take e.g, 300-500 pictures in a run, get home, select the better ones, and leave all the others on my disk too. 90% of them are blurry, or over/underexposed, and kind of useless. I was thinking keeping them, but calculating for storage, backup and stuff, recently I'm about changing my mind. If I purge my library from unusable stuff, I'll have around some thousand pics instead of the 40k I currently have (from most of which aren't good), and I wouldn't need to be concerned about storage and backup for a while (reducing my 2TB of images to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-200GB, which I can totally support with the current home and cloud infrastructure I use (inc. kept raw files).
 What do you guys think? 
 If there are any photographers/videographers here, what do you do with kind of useless material? You delete is? Or keep it either way? If keeping it, do you keep it in RAW or some compressed image format?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post this, so very sorry if this feels a bit out of place. 
 I use a MBP 2021, so a macOS user but do have access to a parallels VM incase I need to use Windows programs. I have multiple HDDs and an SSD, but today an HDD I've used for around 5-6yrs started getting disconnected from my laptop with high frequency. And it was abysmally slow, the last time I checked it could only do 5mbps write when data wasn't being read/written to it in the background.
 I knew that the HDD was in its last legs, but I procrastinated over getting a new one just because I was naive and new to hoarding data. I quickly ran over to a store and bought a new 2TB WD HDD. 
 Now I've spent a few hours trying to switch my data, but it shows an estimated time to copy of about 20-45mins for a 500-700mb file. If I kept this pace, it'd take me like a week to transfer everything over, and doing a transfer like that freezes Finder even when I'm trying to move and browse through files even on my laptops on board SSD. I know that the bottleneck here is just the fact that my HDD is old AF and there's not much I can do except just move the files over a long period of time. But I came here looking for something that could help me in future if not now.
 Is there any way to make this painfully slow process even a bit more efficient and quicker? I'm currently using Finder's drag and drop copy paste feature.
 Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y’all. Sorry if this is a super noob question. Well, not “if.” I’m sorry that this is definitely a noob question.
 I have been trying to wrap my brain around ripping our large collection of dvds, Blu-ray’s, and 4K movies. 
 Maybe I’m dumb but my brain is hurting. I’ve watched YouTube tutorials and all that and I still can’t seem to find the “ELI5” tutorial I need to figure out what hardware and software I need. 
 Has anyone on this sub done a very simple tutorial? I searched past threads and can’t find just a simple tutorial, mainly I just find threads troubleshooting issues I don’t understand yet because I haven’t gotten that far. 
 Alternatively if anyone lives in Utah I will drive my collection to you and pay you to do this for me lol. Whatever you charge is probably worth it to me. I am very upset because I wasted tons of time entering all my digital codes on movies anywhere, iTunes, etc only to find out you can only download them for offline viewing for 90 days before you have to log in to verify you still own the device, etc.

 Convinced a company to donate to the high school I teach in half of the datacenter they where no longer using. 200tb emc2 storage, 50tb emc2 storage, 2 dell r910, a whole blade unit with 16 blades, 4 HP servers, Palo alto pa5220 firewall, few Cisco l3 switches, racks - all functional.
 We run all our services in the cloud as of now, so all of that will go to "my" network lab.
 My plans for now are basically using the blades so students can format and put services to run on em to have server experience.
 And the rest - got no clue for now :P
 What would you run?

 But, now I'm not getting ipv6 to track to the LAN. What are your IPv6 settings? I know I had to change them to get pfatt working, but now I can't remember the default!
 Any help appreciated 
 Here is the WAN config

Something you have to provide proof of life to not trigger some automated actions like sending emails, accessing credentials, web-hooks, etc. If something already exists, great, if not, I've been thinking about making one myself and open source.
 What do you think? I think we can have a discussion about it here to make life easier for our relatives and friends.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a used mini pc (NUC like) where i can connect an internal 3.5" hdd. Meaning it should have at least one sata port (in addition to one sata or m.2 for the system drive) and a power connector with 12V.
 I thought this couldn't be a complicated problem, but it seems like it is :(
 It has to be x86 because of software requirements (proxmox and maybe a windows guest) and it has to be a mini pc because of power consompution (with already .35€/kwh and likely more in the next months in germany this is quite important...) and space requirement.
 I'm looking for use devices on ebay because I don't want to spend over 200€ for the system including ram and system drive.
 Would be very happy about suggestions :)

 Might sound dumb, but I'm a total noob. I've seen/read a lot on the internet about "you can't send email if port 25 is not open", which is often contradicted by articles that advise not to use it because ISPs hate it, and use port 587 instead. So do I actually need port 25? I want to use Axigen MTA on Google Cloud Platform, which has port 25 blocked, but port 587 open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For new friends: Logto helps you build the sign-in, auth, and user identity within minutes. We provide:
  
An OIDC-based identity service
 The end-user experience with username, phone number, email, and social sign-in
 Support web and native apps with various SDKs
  
In the new release:
 We’re super excited to announce some new capabilities in this release that will make Logto more accessible to developers and users all around the world. Get a taste of them and tell us what you think! 
 Sign-in Experience i18n
 The warm reception Logto has received since its initial release in July has resulted in numerous language contributions from the community. This motivates us to localize and tailor the sign-in process even more.
 Now, we're ecstatic to announce that Logto Sign-in Experience has full support for i18n, which means your products can reach a wider global audience and offer more personalized and contextualized options for all users.
  
We have 6 predefined languages to choose from, all of which were created by our international community and can be modified to your liking.
 
Support for up to 113 language tags, allowing you to use your own translation in order to reach the vast majority of countries worldwide.
 
 The admin console already includes this functionality. The "Language" section in "Others" tab of the Sign-in Experience page is where you'll be able to rapidly set up and manage your keys and custom values.
 CLI: Exclusively for Logto
 Combating with complicated commands? That's not how we roll. So we're bringing some friendly little things to keep the elegance going even in the command line.
 If you're trying to install Logto on your machine, skip the long, scary install command. It now reads:
 bash npm init @logto 
 And you are all set. Check out Using CLI for a detailed explanation of how to use Logto CLI.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using Bitwarden for a while, it is simply awesome, but it lacks a feature that just become a dealbreaker for me: I cannot add passwords with their API/CLI. The use case is simple, I have some ansible playbooks that deploy my selfhosted services to a k8s cluster, this playbooks generate secrets and I would like to add those secretes automatically to my password database so I can access them easily and not having them lying around in some yml file and I can't be bother to register the by hand. 
 Which password manager can you recommend that supports this feature? Do you have any othe suggestions about how can I achive this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title says it all. I've tried every combination of setting in the book and I can't get it to work.
 My config is 2XSSD 2-column mirror + 7XHDD 5-column parity on Win10 for Workstations. It sets up the tiers properly but then only allows the HDD tier to be used at 50% efficiency. Looking at individual disk IO I can see that it's striping only two disks instead of 5. Something seems to be forcing the config into mirror-mirror instead of mirror-parity.
 Please note that I'm talking about Storage Spaces, not Storage Spaces Direct. I've scoured the MS documentation and the internet and can't find any reference to Storage Spaces not supporting mirror-accelerated parity but it's Microsoft so who knows? Even MS tech support can't find a definitive answer for me as to whether Win 10/11 supports this.
 Have any of you ever gotten this setup working and, if so, how the hell did you manage it?
 Thanks!
 P.S. - And, with all due respect, please don't just suggest that I dump Storage Spaces and use some other product. It's not an option for this application. If I could do that I already would have.

 Some spider that can create a sitemap, maybe? An automated tool to download all images in some directory?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I bought a bunch of old used parts on eBay and build a modest server. It's a 4c/8T Xeon, m-ITX SuperMicro board, in a Node 804 case. I currently have 2x SSD cache and 5x HDD. I learned a lot but I've outgrown it and really want an upgrade. A few things I learned:
  
Regret the Node 804 case. Was a pain to build in. I wish I went full size ATX with a vertical stack of 8 drive bays. Eyeing the Fractal Design Define 7.
 Liked the piece of mind of ECC RAM and dual Ethernet
 IPMI came in clutch a few times
 I don't have enough cores/threads, I'd want at least 8c/16T next time
 I don't have enough PCI slots, only had enough room for one transcode GPU for Plex and one SAS card to expand the 6 SATA ports
 I wish I got a CPU with Intel QuickSync to use for Plex
  
So to address the PCI issue, I figured a board with 10 SATA slots (2x SSD cache, inevitable 8x HDD) would clear that up, be better for cable management, and be one less point of failure vs my SAS card. Plus if I could find a CPU with ECC and QuickSync I'd save a PCI slot. Now I'd have enough room for 1-2 GPUs to finally have better VM performance. I'd want 1 light gaming VM and 1 productivity/streaming VM which could benefit from a basic GPU. If I ever needed more drives I still have my SAS card. So 3 PCI total.
 Another thought, is 10gbe worth it? None of my devices are ready for it, but how nice is it for future proofing? My main computer is an M1 MacBook Pro so I at least have Thunderbolt 4.
 Lastly, I can see a benefit in having a second cache pool for VMs. Probably just a single M.2 drive for VMs.
 The issue with all of the above, is it seems a board that supports: ECC, IMPI, M.2, 10x SATA 6gb/s, Dual 10gbps Ethernet, is $570 which is a lot to go for. It seems only the SuperMicro X11SPI-TF checks all those boxes. Is it worth it in the long run? Or what compromises should I have? I'd appreciate any advice.

 My question ultimately is will upgrading the drives prolong the life of this server, or should I just build something new that is a little future proof? I want my sever to be a decent media server and also be able to host various VMs. Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I'm looking for recommendations for dedicated Mac hardware to use as a build CI/CD server for some of my own projects. I've gone the route of VMWare / KWM / virtualization solution but the performance is poor and honestly just not worth the headache to hackintosh it from Apple.
 I've been looking at something like a 2019 / 2020 Mac Mini because the RAM modules should still be upgradeable. Are there any recommendations for specific Apple hardware that has a few years of OSX support still remaining? I've thought about doing a Macbook as well, but I plan to run it mostly headless, so the extra size is not something I'm eager to waste space on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have a number of servers which are all encrypted or only grant access via a private ssh key. Furthermore I have my backups distributed on 3 locations. There are 3 to 4 copys of every file (raid not included). I use restic and btrbk.
 Now I was wondering - what if I loose all me 3 clients at once, let's say due to flooding. How would I be able to access at least one of my servers to regain all over access to the "fortress".
 I need some sort of an easy to remember, not password protected (ideally), public space to either host a ssh private key or even better my keepass db.
 Any ideas?
 If you have a similar setup, I would like to hear your fallback plan.
 So far I have the following ideas:
 Gist / pastebin a ssh private key somewhere.
 For an attacker it's hard to find the right user, server, port combination (but not impossible!). The server could host the keepass db or other files. Downside, after, let's say a flooding, it might takes weeks before I would care about accessing my servers again. There is a chance that I'll even forget the combination.
 Public cloud, gdrive, more or less similar to gist / pastebin.
 Hosting the keepass db files itself, seems to insecure to me, even if my passphrase has 30 characters. Someone could just download it and use high powered brute force to crack it.
 Another idea would be a second keepass db on a public cloud, with a private ssh key and only hints, that would help me remember, but not give anything away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since setting up my UnRAID server, I am pondering how to sort out all my documents. The sorting of these is a work-in-progress after a massive scanning session, and now the documents are sitting in a network share. Some are nicely named and live in a sensible folder structure, and a lot aren't - at least for the moment.
 I had considered using Paperless-ngx as a way to use automated tagging and OCR to make searching for things easier in the future. However, I believe that Paperless-ngx works by consuming documents within an 'import' directory, and from that point on the document will live within the docker container. This doesn't seem great to me as I'd rather have full control of the document locations.
 Am I correct in my thinking? I was wondering if there's a document system that works similar to how PhotoPrism works: point it at a directory and let it chew over everything there, writing tags and other information to its own database while leaving the original files untouched.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any wisdom shared.

Before I start throwing anything of matter on it I want to make sure it is secure. Typically I would install a firewall VM and route traffic through it. However this machine only has one IP and I cannot order another one as it is not even an option. All the writeups I see require using two IP's. I did find a good writeup of using shorewall but it was from 13 years ago so it did not apply to todays setups. So with all that said: any tips on securing this box to where I can run everything through a firewall vm, still access it remotely, and expose a few ports?

In the past I bought those Samsung SDD drives t5 and t7. These non brand ones are clearly made to look almost identical to Samsung one except to mention of Samsung. Their colors, their shapes, and printed text on look just like Samsungs except they are.
 I tend to believe that something that is too cheap and offers too much for much less is probably somehow compromised in quality. So, I was wondering whether anyone has bought and used those, or maybe checked who makes the drives inside

Unfortunately it's not right behind the outlet (I checked, wiring looks fine), so fixing it myself is beyond my skill level...guessing it would require running a new line, which is probably 1k+ from an electrician. So options are pay for that (f-me), install a gfci outlet (I know this won't really help with surges), or use it as-is. 
 It's hard to explain, but it's in a difficult location and I can't really run an extension cord to another outlet unless I want to get something like 50ft or more and run it around door frames. 
 So...am I SOL?

 Centurylink in my area (Chandler, AZ) keeps saying they'll have fiber in my neighborhood "soon" and I want to futureproof, but I've never worked with fiber before in any capacity and I have no idea what I need to buy.
 Currently, they appear to be using Adtran total access 352 (based on what my coworker has) but all I can find is that it needs an SC/APC connector, and that its 1 fiber. Do I need single or multimode fiber? And what diameter fiber?
 Additionally, are there any other fiber cables I should run to the wall to better futureproof? I'm not sure if residential fiber standards may change by the time they get to my neighborhood, but I've already run 2 ethernet cables to that wall as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an external (USB-connected) HDD formatted with NTFS that I want to move its files to another HDD formatted with Ext4 (and later to another HDD formatted with Btrfs). Since many of my files on the NTFS volume have strange filenames (UTF-8, Asian characters, etc.), I'm afraid the NTFS driver on Linux would mess things up.
 An experienced user suggested using Samba/CIFS/SMB file sharing to transfer my files, using a Windows VM on my laptop and a virtual network adapter (unfortunately, I don't have any other computers). I'm running Fedora 36. This sounds complex and confusing to me because I'm a noob and don't know much about networking. I've already installed the Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox, and spent so many hours trying to find something from the internet, but I'm lost.
 Your help would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Ubuntu VM set up with docker and Nginx-Proxy-Manager (NPM) (plus some other containers to test with). I have ingress the proper ports and can reach my services thru <public ip:port>. On Cloudflare, I have an A record for <domain.cloud> pointed to <public ip> and CNAMEs for <service>.domain.cloud pointed to <domain.cloud>. Cloudflare origin certs have also been added to NPM for HTTPS.
 The problem is getting NPM to resolve. No matter what I've tried, I cannot get DNS to resolve any service. I've got ingress on 80 and 443, I've checked and added them to ip-tables, and even tried creating and using a load balancer. 
 I've had a homelab set up in my house for couple years now, so setting up NPM and cloudflare isn't anything new to me, what is new to me though is the Oracle Cloud side of things.
 Also, I have a Cloudflare tunnel set up and working, no problems. But I don't want to use the tunnel for a few services (Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, Kavita, anything that streams any kind of media) because I don't want to deal with worrying about breaking CF's ToS or anything, hence why I want to use NPM.
 I've tried to search for a solution on Google many different ways, and nothing has helped. What am I missing here? Please help and thank you.
 EDIT: Currently, resolves with Bad Gateway Error 502, but I've seen others as I've tried different things, 502 being the most common.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My 8TB external WD hard drive is almost full (80GB remaining). It contains video and subtitle files. I've been storing data in it for over 2 years. I recently read that the magnetic tape will lose data over time. There is also the added risk of hard disk failure (although I only use it for storage).
 My question is: how long should I wait before I transfer data to a new disk drive or is there a software for refreshing data like Diskfresh etc?
 I've also had two separate 1TB drives for audio storage and have been using them for 7 years without any sign of data degradation (some files are over ten years old).

I currently have eight 8TB drives, but they are full.
 So far the best deals I found are:
 WD Red Pro 16TB at $299.99 each on many websites.
 Seagate Enterprise 16TB at $219 each https://www.ebay.com/itm/354163479355
 Toshiba Enterprise 18TB at $285 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z5LFWD?th=1
 Not a complete deal breaker but someone told me that enterprise hard drives can be quite loud.
 I checked out https://shucks.top/ but seems I will save only about $10 per drive to shuck them and they won't be red.
 I also checked out https://diskprices.com
 My main uses for my NAS will be downloading, seeding, storing, and playing music and movies via Plex.
 Thank you for any advice that you may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only have a couple of users, but it's still very useful for me.
 If you don't know, authentik is an identity provider that supports OpenID, SAML, LDAP and Proxy Auth out of the box.
 I have secured all my services with it, and it's working great.
 It can also do MFA authentication, except with LDAP.
 Previously i've used LDAP servers and keycloak but authentik was much easier to setup and maintain.
 The biggest issue i've ran into is services not supporting central authentication, but that was only a few of them, and i've mostly switched to alternatives.
 I suggest everyone set it up in their selfhosted environment - it makes it feel a bit like an integrated "cloud"
 some of my notes about doing this:
 OpenID/SAML make your apps redirect to your authentik instance's login screen which can be customized. You only have to login to authentik once, and then just grant the applications access when you login to them. 
 LDAP should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't have 2fa and is quite an old protocol, so I suggest using it only when an app doesn't support other options. 
 Proxy auth also displays the login portal, but it works on the reverse proxy level, so reverse proxy forwards requests to authentik, which makes sure the user is authenticated. Authentik then forwards the requests to the app, with a special header with the username. This option is best for static/single page/single-user apps, but not ideal for most of them as it will break mobile apps and some APIs due to it's low level nature. Some apps have explicit support for proxy auth and work just as well with it as some do with OpenID. 
 Authentik docs have per-app instructions which show the recommended way to set it up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I want to set up a VPN so that servers that I connect through it doesn't know I am connecting through VPN. I used WireGuard on rented VPS for those purposes. But the main problem is that VPN server IP is easily recognized as IP that belongs to hosting provider. So what I decided to do is to put Raspberry Pi at my home and set up WireGuard on it. 
 But I run into a problem. I need to be able to connect to WireGuard server (peer) from outside. And my internet provider doesn't provide me with a public IP to my router, rather than router is behind internet provider NAT which I can't control.
 There is an option to opt into static IP. But they might have a separate pool of static IP, which may raise some red flags that I might be using a VPN. Also, preferably, I wanted to have different incoming and outgoing IPs of my VPN.
 One of the possible ways is reverse tunnels to Raspberry Pi. But since ping is also an issue, I either have to have a server in the same city or use a direct connection.
 What are my best options? My main priorities are to keep my VPN IP less suspicious and keep ping as low as possible (but the distance between server and client is 7000km+, so extra 10-20 ms won't matter).
 If reverse tunnel to can I do it all purely on WireGuard. Let's say I have peer with public IP to which both VPN server and client are connected, and use VPN server as gateway on my client?
 And are there any options to connect directly? I heard something about STUN, but haven't tried it.

 https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/217806/195675958-3ecf972e-e9aa-437d-ad68-b7d29fcc6562.png
 There are many feed readers, but none quite matched my desired use case, so I just wrote my own. It was fun! And I think it works pretty well.
 Here's a demo: https://news-demo.orpington.software
 Features
  
Light and dark theme
 PWA support
 Collections
 Syntax highlighting in code snippets
 Configurable article fonts
 OPML import
 RSS feed auto-detection from page URL
 despite being built with TypeScript - small Docker image size (only 58 MB compressed)
  
For more details (and installation instructions), see GitHub. Please enjoy!
 Any questions, suggestions, or feature requests are more than welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm interested to hear what kind of security and monitoring measures you all use for your servers and the services that you're self-hosting.
 My approach isn't very extensive so I'm looking for areas where I could make some improvements. So far it's:
  
Tighten SSH 
 Use SSH keys for authentication
 Disable root login
 Change the default port for SSH connections
 Tweak some of the miscellaneous settings in sshd_config
 
 Use fail2ban
 Use Cloudflare (DDoS protection features, caching reduces load on origin server, hide origin server for DNS entries)
 Deploy apps dockerised when possible
 Use NGINX as my web server/reverse proxy 
 Force HTTPS connections
 Use NGINX authentication for services
 
 Use a password manager to generate strong credentials for every service/account.
  
Some things which I'm looking to add in the future are:
  
A backup solution for logs and other important files, on a daily basis
 An extra layer of authentication via Authelia or something similar
 Remote access for sensitive apps via a Wireguard tunnel (though this isn't something I need, at least for now)
 Find some kind of monitoring solution for app and server logs
 Find a Intrusion Detection System to use but I don't know if this is overkill?

 I want to offer users a place where they can leave a ticket if they have a problem. I have a strict user data policy, that I won’t collect data within the app. I know to submit a ticket the user will send data, and I’m collecting it. The best I can offer is a selfhosted solution, so it won’t leave my server. 
 My question for you guys is what would you recommend?
 Here is some info/requirements:
  
I’m very busy so I would like to be a fire and forget solution I could deploy simple on my cluster. An helm chart ofc the most simple.
 
I don’t have employees and don’t have plans to hire anyone so no need for collaboration functions. 
 
It doesn’t need to be fancy for the users. They just need to be able to leave feedback/problem tickets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking to get into homelab and for my first project I want to get my own router. Now I was thinking of virtualizing a router on a small machine and using that. I saw a few thin client recommendations regarding the hp t620 plus and the hp t730. I've also recently learned about the existence of nucs. 
 I can't for the life of me figure out the difference. They are similar in price. They seem to have the same components. They seem like exactly the same devices. What exactly is the difference between a thin client and a nuc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, apologies if this is not particularly the appropriate subreddit for this post. I figured it might be worth a shot given the nature of the situation.
 I'm trying to digitise a small handful of VHS tapes. My original plan was to plug my VCR into the Xbox One via an AV-HDMI adapter/upscaler, and then use OneCast to connect from my computer and just do a screen cap. The problem now is that Microsoft have locked down the OneGuide app that takes in HDMI input and doesn't allow apps like OneCast to stream from that app anymore (same with apps like YouTube etc.). Maybe somebody knows of a different app that can capture an Xbox stream?
 Short of buying a capture card, are there any ways around this? Having a device in front of me with HDMI in and out, plus a 2-way AV-HDMI adapter, plus a VCR and a computer is making me think there has to be a solution with what I have.
 Again, I know the most obvious solution is "buy a capture card". I'm just trying to work with what I have at the moment. And if I do end up needing to purchase one, what would be your (budget) suggestions? Thank you in advance, and sorry for the wall of text!

 ​
 you will find the detailled instruction on github : NAS low Power Low Cost
 (step by step for the beginner like i am. from flashing the SD card to setting the SBC bootloader to look for USB drive to boot, to setup SSH and each of the basic services)
 for the hardware : it's a rockpro64 with 6x SATA 3.5 Drive (under 50W during start up, 200$ without drives)
 for the software : armbian with ZFS (this is story in itself as it was non trivial to get ZFS to run on ARM hardware with armbian), docker to host my service as container, cockit for a nice and shiny dashboard of the server and portainer for the container management
 on the service side :
 - syncthing : (selfhosted onedrive with syncronisation of my data accross all my device, easy to setup and use)
 - radicale cardav (but a nasty bug deleted all my calendar event when another got added from another device so I need to investigate and maybe replace it)
 - dashy (custom dashboard because it's a must around here and it's easy to setup)
 - transmission for torrents
 and many more to come as i only use 40% of the 4GB of ram and under 20 % CPU

Honestly shocked to see how much they cost. They're basically a cheap piece of plastic with daisy chained SATA connectors, USB, and a 12v out. Really nothing complex. Looking at £80-100+ for that. Madness. I know inflation is bad all-round, but items containing such materials can still be produced rather cheaply.
 I'm actually regretting throwing away the Western Digital enclosures that the hard drives come in originally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a professional photographer (on the side, full time back end infrastructure engineer full time) and I have been thinking about reducing the impact of storing ~1Tb of RAW photos and/or video from each client project. 
 My idea take inspiration from a (mostly) immutable backup project I am working on at work. Use tapes. To set the stage I am looking at this from a "per-project" standpoint not a "backup my entire storage infra" standpoint. 
 I think would easily be able to fit a entire project (wedding, event, concert, etc...) on a single LTO-5 tape. With that I would double up and mirror the tapes and then just have them in a decent (but not great, admittedly) climate controlled environment for potential future access for up to 2-3 years after the project. So effectively I keep the "good" raw's and clips on my main storage array and then offload all of the project as a snapshot onto 2 identical tapes (original files, project files, and final exports).
 My goal is to reduce the spinning disks I need to maintain, decrease power usage, and decrese the space utilization of one off projects that I will likely never need to touch again, and still maintain that data for as long a possable for my own comfort and client good will. 
 I am thinking I can find a LTO external SAS drive for ~$350, tapes for ~$9 per, and use something like bacula to manage the tapes.
 Thoughts?

 I know that we can ask DDNS providers (like DuckDNS) for a subdomain (e.g. example.duckdns.org), and it will point to my IP as long as I keep updating DDNS entries with tools like ddclient.
 Say I buy a domain from some domain registrar. What do I need to do to ensure the domain points to my IP? Does it still involve DDNS providers? And is the process different with different registrars?

 I have the DNS set to the IP of the firewall and another to 8.8.8.8.
 Upon removing 8.8.8.8, DNS still does not resolve, but I lose internet access. This leads me to believe the tunnel cannot get to IP_OF_FIREWALL for DNS requests.
 I can ping and access everything (including IP_OF_FIREWALL) by IP on my subnets, but DNS will not resolve.
 I have tested this on Windows and Android, both externally. Everything works except DNS.
 ​
 I feel like I'm missing something here whether that be a firewall rule or something stupid. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

It really seems like unlimited cloud storage is dead, and doing the math, backing up my 18TB ZFS pool to e.g. B2 would cost $90 a month (!), compared to what I paid with CrashPlan before they went belly up. And I was on backblaze until I stopped daily driving a single windows machine. 
 I’m gonna shut up before I ramble, but I’m curious because searching around the sub I sure get that impression.

Any user experience on bays that were used in this case, or generally recommend?
 I was looking at this, but don't want a fire hazard as well. Actually looks like the old norco ss-500.

 I looked into following options but all store data unencrypted:
  
Synology - SMB
 Raspberry Pi OS - SMB
 OpenMediaVault -SMB
 Create Veracrypt container on a SMB shared folder. But as SMB is file level storage, wouldn't it upload/update the whole file when a change is made inside the Veracrypt container?
  
Any recommendations for SMB? Preferring it due to the robust support available across OSes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got some music on my hard drive which I listen to and seed via bittorrent. Problem is, it is a lot of random folders, some with discographies, some with separate albums, all in different formats, with a lot of broken tags and some other weirdness. I'd want to back all this up in a more organized format: something like a bunch of "artist/album" folders, with all the files in a single format (AAC, maybe?) for file compression. 
 For that, I've tried using SoundConverter. While it does work, more or less, it is quite bugged - sometimes it just puts files in random places, it can't handle album icons, and when there are issues with tags (No tags, tags with spelling issues, tags with encoding issues, you name it) it does weird things. 
 I thought about trying to hack around some Python to do that for me, but I feel that it is a problem which is probably solved already. Despite that, I wasn't able to find any software better then SC. What programs do you use to organize your stuff?

 hi all,
 my archive recently is growing fast, and so is my worry of file corruption**–** mostly involving compressed archives and iso's
 so i ask, what is the best way to handle such file? it is to decompress and store them or just store the compressed archive in a dedicated section? and the iso's?

 Backstory is my 18 year old nephew is using dodgy movie watching sites and such on the WiFi at his Nans and Moms house which raises concerns with the ISP and possible viruses. I've tried advising him so far from an IT Professional standpoint but he's still playing the "I know better" card with his Mom and Nan so they want a solution from me to stop him doing those things on their networks as they don't trust him to listen to what I've told him (and I'll be doing it on mine but I already have better routers)
 Naturally because he's 18 so software on his laptop isn't an option so content filtering at a network level feels the best way to go.
 tl:dr - I need a method to block certain content for a certain device (or devices) at a network level as a software block can't be installed on the devices

 I'm interested in getting a NAS, although I'm having some trouble on what route to take, hoping to get some advice here
 I'm currently debating on whether I want to buy a Synology NAS or maybe just finding some old PowerEdge tower server that can fit 4 bays (going to be buying 4x4TB Red Plus HDDs, should be sufficient for my storage needs ~ for now ~)
 But the Synology NAS is quite expensive, around $550 here in Canada - pre tax
 I don't mind the cost, but one thing I plan on doing is accessing this NAS outside the network, going to be keeping it at my parents until I have a big enough space to keep whatever I get
 Would the Synology NAS be good in this case? 
 I've searched around on the subreddit but haven't had much luck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I like running a command to essentially mirror my 6TB drive to another identical 6TB drive every week or two. For now, I prefer it to RAID. The command is set up to only mirror files that have been changed, rather than copying EVERYTHING each time. Th initial mirror back in the day was a big one, but all subsequent ones just update what's been changed.
 The issue I have is that the destination drive ends up with less available space than the source drive, even though they should be identical in size after the mirror.
 Currently, the source drive shows 276GB/5.45TB free, while the destination drive shows 178GB/5.45TB free.
 If I click into each drive and manually check all the file sizes, they come out identical, yet somehow the drive summary graph always shows higher usage on the destination drive.
 I have hidden files being shown, including protected OS files. I should note that both drives are separate from the OS drive, and only used to store media files.
 I don't have any compressed files on either drive. Both drives have a cluster size of 4096 Bytes, with 512 Bytes per sector.
 I'm just stuck scratching my head as to why the drives show different file sizes. It's like there's a super-hidden file somewhere on the Destination Drive, but I can't find it. Any guidance is appreciated!
 EDIT: Here is the RoboCopy command for reference: robocopy P: B: /mir /v

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I am starting building my home lab and I plan to have a 1 node k3s cluster to host a few apps for personal use, like NextCloud, Jellyfin, PiHole, etc.
 While some might say is overkill, I like the ease of deployment and management that k8s gives, using industry standard practices and tools like GitOps with FluxCD.
 It will also be a great way to increase my k8s knowledge and to play with tools like Prometheus for monitoring, Istio, etc, in a more real-life scenario. And will be a lot funnier too :)
 I also have an old QNAP NAS, that I use to store media and backups. Eventually, if I install NextCloud or Jelyffin in my K8s cluster, I would like to use the NAS as storage device.
 My main doubt right now is if I should get a new and more powerful NAS with like 8 GB RAM and a Quad Core…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have used Nginx Proxy Manager for a while now as a reverse proxy and to manage my SSL certificates, for items like my own static site and Jellyfin, and I never have much trouble getting it to work. I've decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I'm having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.
 Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver's docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:
 version: "3" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 
 I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let's Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:
 Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server's IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes 
 When creating a new SSL certificate:
 - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains 
 All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed
 The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I've set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I'm unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I'm completely out of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have multiple 5 TB external hard drives for backing up a family video collection. These drives are all less than one-year old. 
 Several of drives have had same issue over the past few months: slow initialization/mounting and slow transfer time (around 10/mbps). I have seemingly tried all I can think of to isolate the issue: tried different Macs, different formats (APFS and Mac OS Extended), different cables, etc. Sometimes it improves, but then reverts back to being slow. The interesting thing is that I tried WD’s 2 TB models and have not had these problems. 
 I running Mac OS Catalina on a late 2013 iMac and a M1 MacBook (2020) running Monterey. The source drive is a Samsung T7 2TB SSD. The targets/backups are WD 5 TB Elements USB 3.0. For backup software, I use Carbon Copy Cloner. 
 Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have never archived any data before, and I think it's time to sort out my mess of hard drives before it's too late. 
 I'm looking at archiving my photos, videos and university work to optical media. I'm unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.
 I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.
 The data I'm storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.
 I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it's worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.
 I'd appreciate any feedback on this topic. 
 Many thanks :)

 My docker is running out of space rapidly with only a few containers running.
 Any idea what is taking up all this space in /var/lib/docker/vfs/dir and how to remove uneccesary files ?
 Qbittorrent has downloaded a few files but these are going straight to NFS share on my Truenas.
 Sureley the other containers dont need to use this much space ?

 I know I can setup notifications within many of these services. And many of them don't have notifications functionality built in.
 What I want is a tool that out of the box can scan log files for the services I choose and send notifications over whichever method I choose e.g. Discord, Email, Telegram, etc. This will break the dependence of the service itself having notifications functionality. Sort of like Zabbix, but with much more available templates that cover more services.
 EDIT: There are some must haves:
  
Web interface
 Easily available template configurations for different services like those mentioned above. I don't want to have to tinker and configure the alerts myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is the situation, a few VM on Proxmox on an i7 64GB. Root disk is a 1TB Nvme. Also a 2TB sata disk for data. 
 An ‘old’ (was brand new but replaced by the 2TB SSD) 5400rpm WD blue has been repurposed for backup connected via a USB-C (2 disks) dock. I don’t know if it’s the 5400rpm speed or the dock throughput but I had to ratelimit backup as it was messing a Win10 vm. It’s still not perfect, backup take 12 hours for a 100GB disk. I am looking for a few solutions : - put 2 SSD in the dock (ZFS ?) - Buy a 5 disks USB dock with 3 or more SSD (ZFS ? Again) - Or... As many are complaining about these USB docks buying an old 1U disk rack on eBay. There’s so many options on eBay that I need someone kind enough to point me on the right product. Obviously there’s no 1U disk rack which can be connected via USB so it will be Ethernet and as far as I understood these have a CPU which means a OS so are file servers (correct me if I’m wrong). Can someone point Me to a cheap solution or another way of seeing things. Thanks for your help v.

 I've tried running directly from wine command using display commands to push it one past current display or current display
 I've messed around with winecfg to try and push it through different windows versions.
 Wine desktop crashes it as soon as I try to run exe. 
 I'm wondering if I need to move the program directly onto the native server and attempt to call it from there. 
 Anyone have experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at things like Next loud, OwnCloud, SeaFiles, etc, but just wanted any recommendations or personal experience of what might work best. 
 Here's what I have to pay with since migrating Plex to it's own box (for better CPU and UHD file playback) I have an old super micro board in a 4U EMC Isolon case. Currently running 24x 3TB drives dual Xeon E5645 CPUs (12c/24t total) and 128GB RAM. Like I said it's aging and now that storage has come down significantly I'd like to replace some drives for Plex and use some of these in RAID10 for a private/personal cloud. 
 My parents don't get cloud anything. Their 2TB backup drive, when not misplaced, is about half full, so I shared my M365 user acct so they have that to backup to, but it'd be so nice to be able to host stuff for my family and parents/siblings. That way any time they need help recovering folks or logging in/accessing, we're not resetting passwords or I'm remoting in to unlock, etc.. be nice to just send a link or have it as a mapped network drive or something. Yes their OneDrive is currently hosting the user files in Windows, but still. Something I'd like to get into just because. I suppose I could setup multiple instances to play, but like hearing feedback if possible.

 I knew it was used for file sharing but I had no idea how much it does, so in case there are any other people like me that missed the memo on everything Nextcloud offers here's what I've discovered and in the last 24 hours:
  
File sharing. This is obvious but I want to emphasize how seamless this is. Nextcloud provides an interface similar to google drive or one drive for managing, uploading, and sharing files, and it works perfectly. It makes managing user permissions easy and finally gives me a way to share a link to files on my server. No need to try and get people to m…]]></summary>

 Not sure if this is the right place to post, so apologies if not!
 I ran into an issue with the new Portainer update with the new UI. The font wasn't working and it came with this ugly serif font instead, however weirdly enough it displayed the font when Portainer wasn't accessed behind my reverse proxy
 With lots of googling I've managed to fix it to allow the font to load behind the reverse proxy!
 In your nginx reverse proxy security config under "add_header Content-Security-Policy", add the following "font-src * data: blob 'unsafe-inline';"
 For me, because I use OpenMediaVault this config file was located under /etc/nginx/openmediavault-webgui.d/security.conf, however varying on your setup you might find the CSP line in another file!
 Just thought I'd make this post in case anyone else ran into this issue, as I couldn't find anything similar on reddit quickly & easily. Hopefully save yourself some time if you run into a similar issue! That's all :)

I'm looking to control around 20 SATA CD/DVD ROM drives, so port density and cost become important. Is anyone aware of similar boards - I really liked that the HPM-XU used a USB-B connector instead of the MicroUSB.
 I'm putting all of this into a dedicated enclosure, which will connect via USB to a PC or laptop. I'm specifically looking for solutions that do not require a host computer/bus (other than USB) but do have power within my enclosure to power drives and cards like the U3-QS3.
 FWIW - Most off the shelf cheap USB3 -> SATA cables appear to not support ATAPI.
 I'm not interested in building a dedicated computer to do this - I want a USB3 interface I can move around, and plug into multiple devices w/out having to bring anything else with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this over to /r/linux4noobs but wanted to see what you guys thought of this.
 I have been using a Synology NAS for a while now. In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.
 I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.
 I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.
 So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?
 I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.
 Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?
 The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don't have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI's or something like that.
