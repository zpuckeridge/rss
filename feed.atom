I’m using an SSD for a boot drive and I have 3x 6TB drives. Is it more worth it to add more SATA ports with the PCIe slot and an expansion card or do I use the slot for a low/mid-tier GPU I have (1060 3gb)? Not sure what would be more worth it. I would be using the GPU mainly for accelerated transcoding, but idk if it’s worth sacrificing the SATA speed on 2 of my hard drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading up on various file server options and would really appreciate the sub's input.
 Current setup: Three-node Proxmox HA cluster. TrueNAS Core running virtualized on one Proxmox node with local HBA and disks passed through. Total file storage is only around 5TB.
 Problem: TrueNAS Core is overkill for my current needs. The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can't take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.
 I'd like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I'm looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn't support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data. I've looked at openmediavault, Unraid, Ubuntu server, and stripped-down TrueNAS with a virtualized disk - but can't figure out which path to pursue. 
 Hoping someone has been down a similar road and can offer advice. Thanks!

 This app is to prevent any disputes between me and the users during project discussions and on-site communications (e.g. on what user has requested and how they want the task to be done, signed at the end of the day and a report is generated for recording purposes.)
 The report itself needs to have the following information: - Unique running numbers to keep track of the report, something similar to an invoice. - A table that allows me to input the tasks that has been completed. - A signature line for user to sign. - Date & time of task completion in the report.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to self host a tailscale alternative.. (or similar).
 I've seen a lot of the recommendations but most of them need a fair bit of investment to get them working so i;d like to ask some advice as to which one to sink my time in to..
 What I have : 
  
A VPS with 3x vCPU Core, 25GB SSD RAID-10, 2GB RAM, 3000GB Traffic - 1Gbps Port,1 Dedicated IPv4 Address
 2 Proxmox hosts locally
  
What i'd like : 
 Edit : A web gui!! i need a web gui to administer things!
 A VPN that will allow me to connect in via the VPS (ideally) and access my entire local network. Routinely, i'd be taking down one of my proxmox hosts, so i'd like to host a subnet router or similar on each one so there are failovers should i take one down..
 the VPS should also be able to ping my entire local network (for uptime kuma)
 I'd also like another subnet router for another remote network on a different IP range..
 Tailscale does everything i want on the free tier.. except for having 3 ingress(?) points in to my home network... if i'm not using the correct terminology here or anything else is off.. please tell me..
 Edit : looking at the tailscale documentation they offer a beta feature at the business class level called "subnet router failover" this is pretty much exactly what i'm after.. but you know.. selfhosted and free :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this in r/WireGuard as well, but since r/homelab has a larger membership, I thought I'd see if any of you had any ideas.....
 Ok, so, I have a number of issues trying to keep things running on my external access to my hosted services in my home. All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I've been doing this for YEARS, but I've been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. 
 All that to ask this....I've been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.
 I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.
 That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I'll just use my existing configs for it, but what I'm NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it's just using OpenVPN, but I'm not sure).
 Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?
 Ultimately, I'd like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don't limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode's IP my public IP.
 Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).
 Am I making this too complicated? LOL!
 Any help or thoughts would be appreciated.

 I can confirm that the fan Gantry from a T630 / T640 can be adapted to the T620. I ordered the Gantry from eBay that was for a T630/T640 and I had the fans from a T620 (same fan type that is in the CPU Shroud Assembly) - The only thing I had to do is snip the small metal piece blocking the Fan connectors to go down.

 Use Tin Snips to cut that piece out and Use Needle Nose Pliers to bend the edges back down.

Since the manual is not helping much I'm wondering if I've mounted them correctly. There is a gap in the front when sliding in the case cause of the way the rail is mounted, which does not allow me to fasten the case to the rack in the front, is this normal and secure or should I mount the rack rail further back(1st img)?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a HP Z820 Workstation with 128GB RAM and some SSD drives. CPU = Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v2 @ 3.30GHz (2 Sockets). It runs great, but I am selling it as it uses too much power. About 111 watts to 200 watts depending on what it's doing.
 My Goals:
  
Save on my electrical bill (less watts the better) 
 Have a small foot print (Z820 is a beast) 3)Have the power I need
  
I'm looking at 1 of 2 options:
  
Buy an Intel NUC NUC12WSHi5 and place on a shelf in my 18U rack 
 Build a custom Micro ATX system and place it in a Rosewill 2U chassis to fit in my 18U rack
  
Intel NUC Build: 
  
NUC12WSHi5 - $525 
 64GB RAM - $150 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 1TB SSD (Own already) 
 SABRENT 512GB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2242 - $70
  
Micro ATX Build: 
  
ASRock B660M-HDV LGA 1700 Intel B660 SATA 6Gb/s DDR4 Micro ATX Motherboard - $89 
 Rosewill RSV-Z2700U 2U Server Chassis Rackmount Case - $155
 Intel Core i5-12600 - Core i5 12th Gen Alder Lake 6-Core 3.3 GHz LGA 1700 65W Intel UHD Graphics 770 Desktop Processor - BX8071512600 - $230 
 be quiet! SHADOW ROCK LP - $86 
 be quiet! Pure Wings 2, 80mm Fan - $9 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 6TB Mech. HDD - Own 
 500GB or 1TB SSD - Own 
 1TB or 2TB Mech/SSD for Emby? - Own
 Antec Earthwatts Gold Pro Series EA650G Pro 650W Semi-Modular, 80 PLUS GOLD - $99 
 Crucial 64GB Kit (2 x 32GB) DDR4-3200 UDIMM - $165
  
I believe that the NUC will use around 45 watts~ but am not sure about the other build, I know it's dependent on work load but any guess as to how much power it'll use?
 Here's what I do with Proxmox, at the moment:
  
5 out of the 20 VMs run most of the time, the remainders are just for testing, learning, etc. 
 I run a lot of containers, Linux OS's and a couple of Windows OS's 
 The containers are small, mostly web servers, the most intensive ones are TrueNAS and Emby
  
I will have to put a couple hundred into either build after I make the sale on the tower. Thoughts? Advise?

I made a connection group called “networking” under the Root folder but now anything that I add to the networking group just disappears. If I try to make another group under networking the same thing happens, it seems to add without error but then it is not there when I expand the networking group. If I try to make the group again it says the group already exists. 
 Any ideas of what to check? 
 Also does anyone link directly to guacamole sessions? Im hoping to integrate with zabbix using macros to link hosts to a guac connection such as https://guac.my.tld/#/client/{HOST.IP} but it seems like guac uses auto generated strings for the url. Anyone doing something similar?

 Obs: Fat-32 is not a possibility, since i have files larger then 4gb

 Despite that, i still wanted to opt for a secure setup balancing my technical knowledge and skills, and practical usage.
 Before i started this all, i read up on what other people did and my 'conclusion' was "yeah, i should do that too because that seems right". But lately i am pondering if i should.
 I've created a DMZ network and installed a Treafik Proxy server within it. This proxy will redirect request to the actual application. I've already setup my firewall rules (only allows 80/443, and proxy to my app), the application (on a different VLAN) and even secured the docker socket.

 Recently, i got a hdd and decided to compile all the digital family photos we have from the past like 15 years and organize them so my mother can view them (she loves family photos). How can i rename all the files based on date created? Theres about 2tb of pictures and i dont want to go into the properties of each individual one to get the date it was taken and then rename them lol. Is there a way to rename them en masse?
 Edit: i should say rename by date modified, as the dates created are all recent since they were just created on this hdd. Date modified seems to be the day the photo was taken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, 
 I own a QNAP TS-453D with these inside: 
 - 2 x WD red plus 4TB (WD40EFZX) drives in RAID 1 (39-40°C) 
 - 2 x WD black 1TB WD10JPLX drives in RAID 1 (34-36°C) - using these just becase they're standing and doing nothing for the moment. 
 ​
 I'm going remove the WD Blacks and put another two 8TB drives in RAID 1. I'm considering one of these CMR drives: 
 ​
 WD Red Plus WD80EFZZ - 5640 rpm - warranty 3 years - 25/30 dbA - 255 € 
 WD Red Pro WD8003FFBX - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 29/36 dbA - 277 € 
 Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 - 7200 rpm - warranty 3 years - 28/32 dbA - 219 € 
 Seagate IronWolf Pro ST8000NE001 - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 28/30 dbA - 265 € 
 ​
 I'm using the NAS for two things only: 
  
Plex/Emby server 
 
PC / phone backup 
 
 ​
 The transfer speed right now is ~110Mb/s (1 Gbit link), which is good enough for me. 
 ​
 The price difference right now is not a deciding factor for me at all. But what matters for me more is: 
  
silence 
 
temperature 
 
longevity 
 
 ​
 The PRO's (WD & SG) both have 5 years of warranty - but, from the specs it would seem that it comes at the cost of drive noise (& higher operating temperatures). 
 ​
 Any suggestions for my situation? >> I'd like to have a quiet (and not to warm) NAS that will be reliable for some time.

 Pretty much as the title say, I'm curious if anybody is self-hosting this? 
 If so, have you followed the guide to open all the required ports
 Open TCP ports 80, 443, 33073, 10000 (Dashboard HTTP & HTTPS, Management gRCP & HTTP APIs, Signal gRPC API respectively) on your server. 
 Or have you found some way to chuck a proxy in front of it?

You can minimize the impact of the price change by adding up to 9 additional years to your current registration at only $12 per year."
 That seems like a big jump in price. I'd like to keep my .info domain, so I'm just wondering if there is a better alternative to Google Domains.

 And having Amazon Photos is a nice since it easier to view photos there than on Drive.
 But Drive is shutting down and Photos by itself is no good because the one feature I need to have is the ability to bulk download in the event the service shuts down. I love that Drive has it.
 Does anyone know of any good alternatives that makes it convenient to bulk download in case of an emergency?

 How I imagine that is that you have one client where you can chat and where you also have some kind of dial pad to do sip calls.
 Sofar I wasn't really able to find something that would work like this and the closest thing I found was the old jitsi desktop client which has XMPP and SIP in one application. Which would be perfect if only it wasn't EOL and buggy

 I really only have a modern windows 11 machine however, and my PCIe x8 slot is blocked by my GPU. I would really prefer not having to find a workaround for this.
 My question is, do PCIe x4 SAS HBA cards with the external ports exist? The LTO-5 drive I am looking to buy is a dual SAS one, so I assume I need one that has 2 external ports? I think that's the kind of card I need, anyway. I am novice.
 I've of course tried to search on my own, but it's difficult for a newcomer with lots of unrelated results.
 Thank you for your consideration.

 I pretend to have a machine running 24/7 as media server, with radarr and sonarr. It will also serve as Plex media server. The las function it will have, is going to be a home assistant server.
 I wonder if it is a good idea to invest in a mini server, a good nas, or what I'm thinking, a nuc with a nas connected through usbC
 The nuc is a nuc11i3, and I think that the most basic nas would do the job, as I only need it as storage. I want to do this because I need to do tone mapping.
 What is your opinion /advice?

 Our team members came from early-stage TikTok & Kuaishou. We realized one huge issue during developing those products, operation and marketing teams need a tool to monitor data. It's a very tedious job for developers. Therefore, we decided to build a low-code open-source tool to solve this. Our team believes our product is easy like Minecraft, but we definitely have more possibilities. You can even customize your own "block" in our product and sell it in the marketplace. (The feature is coming soon)
 ILLA is an open source low-code platform to help you to build internal tools in minutes. Alternative to PowerApps, AppSmith, and Retool. Check out our website to know more about us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys, quick question:
 I also want to use my knowledge and server power for good things. Reading about the developments and the cencorship in iran is devastating, but I stumbled across this tweet and this repo by signal to help people in iran get the word out.
 For the signal proxy, they are using nginx and letsencrypt already and the ports 80 and 443. My current setup already involves an nginx proxy as well as a certbot, so how can I host this signal proxy in my infrastructure?
 Some docker and nginx wizards are needed and the help is very welcome! Thanks 
 Edit: This is a blog post about the situation by signal

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years back, I built myself a 50TB server with ZFS and 2 redundant disks. Massive storage beyond my imagination. Of course I have adopted the hoarding ways and now starting to feel the limits.
 I bought a motherboard with a decent number of SATA ports and expanded it with a SAS controller (seemed like a pretty niche piece of hardware!).
 What are my options for further expansion? I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.
 Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this? When I look it up I find a bunch of synology expansions arrays.
 Sorry if this is a silly question, I don't exactly know what I should be searching :).

 I am looking for a solution to basically do a NMAP scan every 15-30 minutes on my network and either alert me of new devices or show me the new devices. Same as doing port and host monitoring. 
 Im not sure if librenms will do this for me but i can look into it. 
 Goal:
  
notification of new devices
 web ui
 port mapping
 latency testing
 non-credentialed scans/ credentialed scans
  
Any ideas would be great!

 My current set up consists of a TrueNAS server with ~8TB usable storage and a Plex VM running inside of it, a Raspberry Pi with a VPN server and PiHole installed, and a Dell Optiplex micropc running Docker which currently has Zabbix and Portainer running on it - I definitely plan on upgrading soon, but as the title suggests, I’m looking for some ideas on what else I would like to run.
 Some ideas for the future: Graphana; some sort of camera managing software for a future security system (found an open source option which looks great but can’t remember the name off the top of my head) and a backup solution that would backup servers to TrueNAS.
 Anyway, what are you people in this subreddit running currently and is there anything you would suggest I take a look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to figure out how to manage access for internal servers running various web apps. (It is important to note that neither these apps nor servers are exposed to the public Internet.) In the past, I have relied on unsigned certificates or even no certificates. However, I am starting to see apps that will not work in either of these configurations and web browsers that are becoming increasingly unhappy about unsigned certificates.
 I get that there are risks with unsigned certs, but these are tightly controlled apps inside my LAN and so I am less concerned. I am familiar with letsencrypt and use that for external facing apps. But all of these servers are internal only and so an external CA makes little sense.
 Any advice on how to handle this?
 TIA!

swap A1 and A2, while swapping A3 and A4. still shows as bad memory in channels A1 and A3.
  
So this tells me that either the r630 motherboard or CPU1 is faulty. 
  
Swapped CPU1 and CPU2. Still shows as memory channels A1 and A3 are faulty.

Buy r730xd barebones and install my cpus, memory, hba, and nic. didn't install in any order grabbed cpu and memory at random. Shows A1 and A3 faulty. repeated steps 1 and 2 with r730xd. Is it likely that I got 2 motherboards with faulty dimms slots/traced on the exact same dimms? I would lean to cpu but swapping them on both servers didnt move the error.

 This is a problem for remote access as well as a service I use that needs to send webhooks to a local server. 
 I set up a Wireguard server on my VPS, setup a tunnel between my firewall at home (PFSENSE) and the VPS, and then I used nginx proxy manager "Streams" to forward the port I need for webhooks to the local host at home
 Now no matter what the internet is doing at home, it will always be able to connect through the tunnel and back to the server
 Now, I want to get a remote access VPN working. I have OpenVPN setup on PFSENSE which works very well for me. I figured I could just do the same and "Stream" 1194 back to the firewall, but it doesn't connect. 
 Has anyone gotten this to work?
 I would just use Wireguard on the VPS, but the outbound internet in Linode is not great, a lot of services are blocked by third party companies from Linode IP's, and the DNS config in OpenVPN is much better than Wireguard and everything in my home network "Just works" via OpenVPN, not so much with Wireguard

Without boring you all with the detail, it took me quite a while to get SSL working on a local intranet via nginx. I am tempted to migrate to a docker container of nginx or caddy, but what I have is also working.
 Who's using what now a days? Caddy seems more... recent in its featureset and development. Is it easy enough to deploy?

 I created a home server to essentially replace and finally get rid of Google's storage forever, and all was going so well until i realised I needed to constantly update my records with my current public IP since my public IP is dynamic.
 Well, when doing this, I found that Cloudflare blocked API use for my domain name, a .tk free domain, for unknown reasons (all i could find relating to this error on Google were just screams of help and no resolutions whatsoever) and now I'm just stuck here confused at how I can have my domain still running effectively without having it drop due to the ISP's IP cycling.

 I'm sharing a nice 1-line command that prints docker network name and it's IP (Gateway's IP strictly speaking). See below.

 Long version
 Problem: in AdguardHome I see all these IPs that are coming from docker containers. I'd like to see which containers. Turns out it's not that straightforward to clearly see what container produces what network at which IP range. (at least not with a simple docker command).
 So, I went on a and wrote a lengthy nodejs script that would loop through docker networks finding these IPs and nicely print them for me.
 Then I realised that there must be an easier way.
 The Bash way.
 So here is the final version of a day's work. Maybe it will help someone save the time :-)

 The command
 (echo "NAME GATEWAY"; docker network inspect $(docker network ls --format="{{.ID}}") --format="{{.Name}} {{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}" 2> /dev/null) | column -t -s " "

 I'm not trying to boot onto the hard drive or anything, just plugged it in for the first time, and am still booting off of the SSD. My assumption now is that my old 450 watt power source doesn't have enough power for it, so it's just causing the power to go off after a second. Any other ideas what might be causing this? Could an incorrectly plugged in drive cause this? I don't see why it would cause it to power off immediately unless it's trying to draw too much power.

Pay for a line to be built (2mile road to nearest fiber conn) 
 
Continue paying for data which throttles at 150GB ($2/GB) 
 
Use my phone hotspot (which also throttles at 50GB) 
 
Rent office space? I can't find any near me
 
 Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me. I start sweating when I see Slack or another JavaScript website download 20MB+. All those little things add up. Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. 
 I've considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I'm pretty sure cell towers are a bust. 
 The nearest library is nice but it's only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. 
 Am I stuck with Starbucks? 
 I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things. Anyone have any experience with rural internet conditions? How do you solve your data cap issues?

 Question for anyone who knows Wireguard.
 I have a VPS, it runs the docker container wg-easy, works great. At home I have a PFSENSE Firewall, I configured the wireguard tunnel with the VPS as the server, and I can get traffic over to the VPS via Wireguard with no problem, speeds are great
 My question is, how do I get the traffic to work the other way? Do I need to add some static routes?
 I read this guide:https://hacdias.com/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat
 That does not mention static routes, so I'm not sure how that exactly works.
 Second question would be, I see that in this guide there is PostUp and PostDown configurations for WireGuard, if I look at the conf for wg-easy, it only has PostUp. Do I need the PostDown?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[jdownloader, raider and other tools fail. instagram has upped "security", so whatever mass downloader you throw at it will trigger a security alert (because they have a new treshold for requests that is very low, I presume) on your profile and temporarily lock it until you 'verify' your account and whatnot, and will likely get re-locked upon trying to download a profile, and even simply crawling it sometimes seems to be enough to trigger it. 
 in fact, lately it seems that jd can't even grab a single picture or video off of it, and raider gives 'no profile found' error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 I'm upgrading my consumer level mobos to server grade and am looking for your experiences. I'm currently planning to get ASUS P12R-M/10G-2T for my pfSense router. Mainly due to that I've learned to trust Asus mobos, it's got 2x Intel X710-AT2, ECC, IPMI, M.2 and is actually available. I'm likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I'm a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)
 - How's the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I'm aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I'll succeed with a 2U though.
 - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?
 - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense? I've got a separate 2x10GbE Intel PCIe NIC too.
 - Other gotchas that you wish you'd known before jumping to server boards?

 https://i.imgur.com/6F4qFHo.png
 https://i.imgur.com/D0dJhvC.png
 But I'm not really getting the desired results. I'm getting notifications whenever anything new is posted there. Even if I put free and 100% in extracting text, I'd get like 3-4 lines with either 100% or free, which is correct, but when new stuff is posted this extracted 100% or free gets moved around and it triggers new notifications.
 What I really want is compare snapshot x(now) to y(old), if new line or new text with 100% or free appears AND is different to snapshot y THEN trigger.
 Not if it moves around, not if it's the same as before.
 A current snapshot looks like that: https://i.imgur.com/bbC5d8q.png
 The diff looks like this and still triggers notifications: https://i.imgur.com/5xnNoQp.png, even though I have checked "new lines" and triggers set to new/100%, I guess moving the lines with "new" and "100%" equals "new lines" which is why it triggers.

 I'm planning out my first media stack (rough thoughts: https://imgur.com/a/A5hqOH5)
 Two specific questions, in order of priority:
  
How should I set up my VPN such that it's only routing traffic from certain services (i.e. the -arr stack and the like) and not from others? 
 If you see the diagram above, should the red arrow be there or is this a misunderstanding?Should all traffic route through the reverse proxy?
 In the described use-case above, how should I set up my VPN? Wireguard on the VM, or gluetun or something else?
 
 Any advice about pros / cons in running k3s / microk8s on VM (proxmox) or bare-metal?
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

I noticed that the Bitwarden extensions and apps cannot synchronise anymore when I put the URL behind CF Access. Most likely, the sync agent just gets redirected to the cloudflare login panel, which prevents it from actually syncing anything.
 I'm using Authelia and Bitwarden's inbuilt security so it's no huge deal, but would be nice if this could somehow still be behind Access as well - redirecting attacks to cloudflare instead of my own server alleviates some of the risks involved and a password manager has to be very well secured imo. 
 If anyone got ideas on how to tackle this, please LMK!

 Still online: 106633 
 Unavailable (Deleted/Unlisted): 24906
 Of those one huge channel with 6000 videos over the past 12 years was recently deleted. Still, a seemingly safe gaming channel has had about a dozen videos either privated/unlisted or deleted (some due to newly added age verification hits)
 I do not wish to disclose the exact channels/videos, these videos will soon end up on archive_dot_org. Though it's a warning to you: add all your subbed and favorite channels to a daily youtube-dl (yt-dlp) download.
 If you subbed to too many channels to create a list manually: create a Google Takeout for the youtube profile you're using, set the smallest archive size. The first archive will contain a CSV with subscriptions.

 What i have found out so far:
 Aio didnt really work because i dont want to expose nextcloud (instead access via nextcloud.local)
 Snap is pretty limited in therms of options. Also docker versions seems to have better performance than the other ones.
 What are the benefits of each one?

 I have two APC R2000 Rack-Mount UPS's for my HomeLab that appear to be completely dead. No output, no lit LED. Checked with known good batteries (from 3rd UPS). I've checked for (visibly) blown components, and confirmed that power makes it past the main circuit breaker.
 I'd like to find someone in the Boston/MA/US region that I can pay $$$ to repair. I can deliver and retrieve, they are too heavy to ship, so I'd like to find someone in the region.
 Thank you for any recommendations.

I have already settled for SSDs as opposed to HDDs because of various factors (biggest ones being power and noise) and I am currently working on a plan to integrate them into a flexible system of drives. Since the Nuc I plan on getting only supports one more 2.5" drive I am going to have to come up with solutions to connect the drives externally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I have a rather large video library (none of it personal videos) it's all made Movies and Series so I can replace it if I have to, though it would be inconvenient.
 I just filled up my 4th 5tb (because they're portable) drive and currently the prices are a bit rediculous, so I'm gonna be stuck with what I have for a few months. I have two 500gb drives, which is barely large enough for anything. i wanted to merge it into a Spanned Volume so that I'd have a 1tb drive.
 My question if one fails then what happens to my data. As i said, I can replace the series, since I got them all from the internet or by backing up my DVD collection, so I don't mind it but it would be inconvenient.
 Since it's just series, performance isnt much of a concern, as long as the shows play smoothly, I'd be happy.
 Also would it ware my drives out faster. They're pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven't seen much use. It's just 500GB's each so I don't mind them breaking in a few years but until the prices of the 5tb's in my country come down a bit, I don't want to replace them.
 Thanks

I have had my drives for about one and a half year on a server that is has very little accessed and I can se the Load_Cycle_Count is already above 45K!! Now I am terrified that these drives will start dying on me. 
 I have these on a Linux system and I am not sure about what to do. I figure I need to install the SeaChest/openSeaChest tool and change some parameters. Does anyone know how to install the tool on Linux and which parameters I need to change? I have the drives set up in a ZFS 2 x mirrored vdev configuration. Are the operations I need to do with the SeaChest tool safe while the drives are in normal operation in the ZFS pool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been steadily accumulating video, photo and audio data, as well as project files as long as I've had a computer. My hobbies have led me to take photos on family/friend holidays, special occasions, press shots for people, footage of music videos/live events, downloaded song library for DJing, the list goes on.
 Anxiety warning - until recently this data was sprawled across a collection of relatively unprotected internal hard drives, old USB thumb drives, external drives, memory cards and my current and past machines. I took it upon myself to consolidate this data on one external drive and have since mostly organised it. For the task I chose a WD 12TB My Book external drive, of which I bought two.
 Question - I want to sync the two 12TB external drives through my Windows 10 machine, I'll call them A and B.
 After an initial carbon copy of the two drives, the dream is to easily update the B drive now and then with any additions or organisation changes that I make on my A drive, automatically (after plugging both drives into the computer), without having to remember the file pathways for each change or addition.
 I have been informed by some lovely folk over at r/Archiveteam that shucking these enclosures and building a NAS system could be an option for me, but I would like to explore any ideas people had that didn't involve buying more hardware. 
 Would appreciate any advice on this, thank you in advance!

 Do I just copy them over (after zipping them or something) to another drive? Do I use a backup software, like rsync or Bacula? I don't understand much about the redundancy thing with Raid and I also don't have the drives or the budget for drives to support it, like some people do.
 My media is mostly movies/shows but there's also smaller files, images, books, etc.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the mods, this is not advertisement nor selling, just asking. well it very sounds like some hustle, but let me tell you.
 I’m korean (south, obviously), and the thing is, recently one of the biggest filecoin mining pool here has been liquidating their equipments. 
 They said most of their disk’s uptime is average 5000-10000h, manufactured in early 2021, I/O barely happened (they have been ‘floating’ as term in filecoin)
 So I thought, “Well, so they’re basically dumping pre-tested HUGE hard drives (datacenter grade even)?”
 So I bought 2 WD HC530 14TB drives and currently waiting for my PERC H310 to come in order to connect SAS drives.
 I've bought dozens of these liquidation deals time to time, and I can tell you these are the good one. almost new. dustless, no scratches.
 And the second thing to tell you is, since current currency rate is very low for korean won, these are even cheaper in dollars. so I thought “Well, maybe I can sell these to datahoarders?”
 So here I am. Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$. These are used, not refurbished.

Standard model, ships in 512e format, Fast Format allows either 512e or 4Kn sector size 
  
and dont know what it means. is this a feature i should be looking for, or something for compatibility? 
 fyi im running a zfs filesystem on my truenas scale server using mainly repurposed desktop components. i am currently using smallish ironwolf drives but my next pool is going to be a mirror of something like 2 x 12+TB drives and i dont want to buy until i understand this feature.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a domain for exclusively personal use. My email service is properly set up with SPF/DKIM/DMARC etc (it gets 10/10 on mail-tester.com).
 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I'm completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a "bad" reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.
 I'm currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don't enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).
 From what I can decipher reading the interview:
  
They're intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical's traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).
 Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned "somewhere between" Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there's currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.
 The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I'll leave it at that.
  
What I didn't see in the coverage (if I'm not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we're talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc's inorganic pitting "secret sauce" or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?
 I'd be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:
  
How optimistic you are about this project?
 Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we're talking WORM) backup.

 Scenario: I have Ubuntu Desktop on VMware. I have multiple users for me and 2 friends so we can share the vm. I am installing xrdp so we can all remote in wherever we are (already have vpn up and running).
 We all use windows as our daily drivers because it's easy and what we grew up on. We will all be using RDP to get in.
 It works fine on my account after enabling the remote desktop bs in settings. Cannot get it to work at all on the other accounts despite all of them having the same settings. 
 Don't know what I'm doing wrong. Please educate me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I recently discovered Dr. John Campbell's YT channel, and in one of his more recent videos he mentioned that he recently received a strike against his channel for proliferating misinformation. If you're familiar with his content, he's been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he's a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it's a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won't be around for long, since he's been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you've ever watched any of his content, you'd know he's extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I'm thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I'm looking at? Thank you.

 I'm rebuilding my server, while adding more features, moving away for it being just a nas box plus a docker host, it will give me the ability to host vms have software raid etc.
 My 2 options were proxmox, and freenas, having worked with the first, the continuous pop-ups about buying licenses, plus the inability to manage network shares on its own, it's a turn off, even if it has a very straightforward way for managing VMs.
 Now, freenas, seems tailored made to act like a nas, with vms feeling like a afterthought, for example, I cannot find a way to have a vm obtain a IP Address from my network's DHCP server, only behind NAT.(on proxmox this was a simple toggle called bridge connection) Documentation on this, imply that bridges are for link aggregation. (https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/network/interfaces/bridgecreate/). If there are any solution to this, I'll be more than happy to to give freenas a go.

 For an internal workflow and data management tool I am looking for the best software. I will most likely use a Postgres Database and would prefer a free project.
 So far I looked at Budibase, Appsmith and Tooljet, of which discarded Budibase for it's weird and non-intuitive UI.
 I wondered what other users think about usability and suitable use cases.
 Thank you so much for giving me an insight into your projects, I highly appreciate it!

 The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I'm looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.
 I've got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they're lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?

 My self-hosting setup
 Legend:
  
Blue Stuff: Mobile
 Purple Stuff: Desktop
 Grey Stuff: My Server
 White Stuff: Other people's servers
 Orange Stuff: Data
 Green Stuff: Actions
  
Suggestions should try to follow these principles:
  
No Software that is written in an interpreted language
 Software needs to be non-commercial and preferably open-source
 If possible, the software should follow an open standard
 Software needs to be standalone, no additional dependencies
 Smaller and simpler is better

 Is there a functional difference between creating a single max size volume vs creating multiple smaller sized volumes as needed? 
 Also can I get a quick run down on partition vs volume vs allocation size?

 I am looking to add more extended battery systems, but am out of rack space to mount them. I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?
 I've got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg
 Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better. I wonder if anyone has had any experience with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am an amateur photographer mostly focusing on wildlife photography but occasionally help out other with events. I am currently self hosting my storage solutions using truenas in a VM that is not exposed remotely. I am looking for some software solutions for the following tasks: 
  
Remote uploading photos from wherever I am. I would like to be able to make backups easily. Deduplication would be nice feature here. This would need security but I believe nginx can handle that.
 File download if someone has a link, username, and password ( does not have to be super secure but ddos protection would be nice). To share files with people and event organizers when relevant. Zipping would be nice
 Basic file/directory exploration. I would like to be able to share a single photo with people or see if I have a photo of a particular bird species .
  
What I have tried:
  
Libre photos does not seem to have upload or download tools and not directory structure
 Next cloud seems to be a lot more that I need and doesn't seem to play nice with truenas for me at least accessing existing files.
 Currently I manually make zip files for sharing and link them in html tag for download but that can be time intensive
  
I would prefer FOSS but I am willing to talk if it's cheap enough. This is all hobby work.

 Question is will an R730 fit in this threaded rack where the depth between the front and back threads is 27.5” (69.85cm)? I found I need to buy the Dell 331-0166 2U PKCR1 2CGTG Threaded ReadyRail Adapter kit to made this work which I’m willing to do but now worried that it’s too shallow for the rails to properly click in and seat the server?
 I don’t care if it sticks out of the back past the rack, I don’t have a back cover. I’m new to this and just want to make sure before I invest in the adapter kit and rails that it’ll slide in there properly. 
 I have a PE 2950 III as well I plan to rack so I’ll need two kits if anyone has one to sell! 
 Thank you!

 It's essentially a multithreaded Python script that takes Discord images (e.g. Midjourney or any channel) and sends the full high-resolution version of the image automatically to Amazon S3 storage (creates thumbnails as well) and also auto-uploads each image as a new post (along with all the details) into the WordPress website.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I've been slowly building up my lab from having a single 6-core server to also having a few older generation NUCs and a laptop. With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don't care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.
 Now, I've installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it's really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. 
 So my questions are: 
 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? 
 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).
 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?
 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?
 Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out. Sorry if some of those questions are basic, I wasn't able to get conclusive answers on the web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I'm thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.
 I've come across some comments like "NAS isn't intended to be turned on/off" or vague comments such as "they aren't rated for that" but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don't see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.
 Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.

 ​
 Just asking if there's already an existing tool, it would be nice to have something where I can have a threshold of how many stars each repository has.
 ​
 I already did most of the work and I can continue using my method, but I'm just asking if there's something that already exists and is maintained.
 ​
 Here are the steps I took:
 I've downloaded all the logs in 2 methods
  
using the API on https://www.gharchive.org/ `wget https://data.gharchive.org/20{15..22}-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz`, it actually ended up being 800GB which is insane
 the other way is to use google cloud platform BigQuery, I downloaded a CSV of users which was almost the size of 300MB CSV file
  
now that I have these, I can then use github api to get their repositories.

 I just got done with installing ssh and I was wondering how can I have movies / series MP4s be watchable with all of my devices? 
 I read that SMB is pretty unsecure. Is there an SMB alternative that is more secure?
 Also having a Web GUI would be cool since I don't have any DE installed.

 The software would need to run on Samsung Smart TV, PS3, mobile devices etc.

The DAS will be connecting to an HP ProDesk 600 G6 Mini which is running as a Plex server / Home Assistant server, and which supports USB C 3.1 Gen 2 (or USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 as HP like to call it!). It doesn’t support Thunderbolt. The DAS won't be moving to any other computers at any time, staying connected to the server.
 I don’t want to add extra stress to the server (i3-10300T and 32gb DDR4-2667 but runs 24/7 for HA) so I’m thinking hardware RAID, and because I’ll be running at least four drives I want RAID 5 support. I can’t fit a RAID card in the ProDesk 600 G6 min…]]></summary>

 Currently I have a home server that I'm running a few services on and exposing some of these (nextcloud, bitwarden etc) to the internet via a cloudflare tunnel and routing internal traffic through nginx proxy manager.
 I've been having a play with some cloud based servers lately, mainly just as a testing ground for projects. I was wondering if it is possible, or even if there would be any security benefits to point my domains/cloudflare tunnel to the cloud server and then route the traffic via a tunnel or VPN connection in to my home server from the cloud server?
 If this is possible and there is an advantage in it please could someone help out with some info on what software/setup you used?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I often see posts or videos about homelab projects and almost everytime I hear no mention about SWAG with nginx or traefik being mentioned instead. I personally use SWAG for reverse-proxy and certs and I'm happy with it but seeing that almost everyone else is using other platform I feel like an outsider and I start to wonder: what am I missing? Is not SWAG the right choice to secure and proxy my web-services? And why I don't see more people talking about it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have an HP envy laptop with i7-10510U and 16gb ram and 500GB SSD (even has a discrete 250MX nvidia GPU).
 It is currently mostly unused, I was running proxmox on it for some time with a few VMs and containers, but currently thinking of migrating to TrueNAS Scale, the obvious problem with a laptop that there are no sata ports (or expandability in general is very limited).
 So in order to really benefit zfs and use it as a proper NAS, the only way it seems is using some sort USB enclosures/dockings for SATA HDDs/SSDs, but I'm not sure if that's a decent option.
 Note: there's a USB-C port which can act as a display port / charging / data - perhaps there are some things for storage I can plug in there as a more reliable alternative to "just regular" USB-A ports?
 Note2: The data stored on it is not super critical, mostly family photos and some movies etc. and I'm backing up automatically to Backblaze anyway, so things like ECC memories and edge cases are not really a concern.
 Alternative option:
 I have a tower gaming PC which is running pretty much 24/7 anyway, so I could through in a bunch of HDDs, and run TrueNAS scale in hyper-v. Though that leaves the laptop without a purpose really, and it has more than decent hardware for a home server.
 What do you suggest?
 Thanks

I am thinking of adding them into my NAS and building a new set based of 12TB drives with maybe 3 more for a total of 5. Am i missing something or should I check something else before buying more?

 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 ​
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. 
 I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. 
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into " nsfw" territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?
 We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.
 Thanks in advance!

 I’ve got my hands on two older desktops which I want to use as a NAS, and for labbing around with in vm’s and such. (Possibly also a BlueIris NVR)
 Pc’s are both running i7-4790’s and have 32GB of 1600Mhz DDR3. Both machines have 256gb of SATA SSD and 128GB of PCI SSD (dont ask about the PCI i dont know either) One also has a Quadro K4000 and the other a Quadro K4200
 Ive also got access to 6x 2TB WD Black Enterprise drives, with 4 being already installed in one machine and 2 sitting cold, as well as the odd 1TB HDD sitting as storage in the other machine
 I’ve and have played with Proxmox on these, but not sure if I have enough power to run or if its overkill for what I want to be doing - eg if TrueNAS will be sufficient
 Not sure how well Plex & BlueIris NVR will go on the hardware due to being virtualised and being on the older side. 
 Would love some opinions! PFA of my dusty and cable mess of new projects! (don’t worry will be cleaned soon)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After having many issues with flash drives over the years, I have recently reverted back to using optical media for backup/ archival purposes. Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. 
 I've found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. 
 I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I'm working on periodically. 
 I've had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them. I use SSDs instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting in r/DataHoarder since we got such a great response last time :) We mirrored a *lot* more books from Z-Library. We were pretty surprised by how much their collection has grown over the last year, since we first scraped it in mid 2021.
 Anyway our full blog post is here: http://annas-blog.org/blog-3x-new-books.html Seeds would be again very welcome. We got a good number of seeds for our first collection, so thanks for helping with that!
 Note for mods: last time we got a copyright strike on our URL. This time we're simply linking to a blog website that hosts no torrents or illegal files whatsoever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was "stored" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)
 I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?
 Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.
 I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical
 (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)
