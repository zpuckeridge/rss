        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title states, I’m using a Cisco RV320 for a side project. It is running the latest firmware. Part of its function is to act as an OpenVPN server. The issue is the default 10 year certificate in the router has expired therefore preventing a VPN connection. I have attempted to create another self signed certificate and marked it as primary to no avail. Also, the OpenVPN server is setup for password authentication only but I believe the router itself requires a certificate.
 Does anyone have any insight on how to handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi people! I'm preparing to move to a new house and i want to run cables from all the rooms from 3 floors. i calculated that up and down i would need 15m cables max from certain rooms. House (located in Europe) has pipes everywhere where i can run easily the cables. Do i really need to put solid cable as it doesn't really pass through walls ? The ideal would be full copper cables/cat6a/23AWG/solid/CMP and Poe++ needed for my various Unifi devices but a proper one from a reputable business vendor with all tests done, etc has around 50 eu. Is it worth it or i could go for a stranded/pure copper/26AWG/poe++/CM from the same vendor with around 15eu per cable ? i know it would cost me probably cheaper to buy a roll and do it myself but i don't really have the time to punch down every single cable and test it separately and i would prefer a ready made solution.

 New to proxmox and servers as a whole. 
 I have an old optiplex with an i7-2600s, 32 gigs 1333 ddr3, and a 500gb pny ssd
 I understand I can't store VMs on the boot media and proxmox doesn't like used drives as I have 2 hdds that I had lying around I was going to use to just mess around with, but won't pop up in the interface. 
 I was planning to replace the CD drive on the computer with a couple of 2.5" drive hotswap bay. I should have enough PCI lanes to put 2 PCI controllers for 10 sata cables (1x and 4x) and buy a couple dozen cheap pny 500gb SSDs and a couple of HDDs as backup drives. 
 I don't have any important data. I'm just playing around with it now and going for a budget build that pushes the limits of my old hardware. I plan to do these upgrades in waves, buy 1 PCI card, 1 hotswap bay, and 6 SSDs. Then later do it again.
 Questions:
 Is there anything I need to consider? Does proxmox work with generic Newegg PCI sata cards? Do I need dedicated raid controllers? I only have a 500w psu, does it need more juice for mass SSD additions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saw a few people post on the topics of CICD, and wanted to ask if anyone has recommendations for the build (this is my first time building server, I have built a PC for gaming). My main problem is, not sure whether I need higher performance cores for build/compilation (both typescript transpilation, node library build/install, and react native compilation out to android) or more cores with lower clocks to scale test parallelization. Is there a way to have cake and eat it too? Has anyone built/specced anything similar? 
 Goals
  
Support self hosted github actions runners with autoscaling, to support nodejs, react, and react native builds + testing. The testing is done with jest, which really likes cores. More cores = more tests that run in parallel.
 
A centralized way to manage files and folders as a place to back up across various laptop and media devices. Also support future home projects around video storage. I like the idea of a NAS with the additional functionality of general server/compute.
 
Support docker containers, devops tooling, and environment to learn all the fun networking items for self hosting webapps.

 I currently have sas drives but was thinking maybe I should switch to cheaper SSDs and they are brand new.
 Anyone done that knows what should I do? I know SAS has better performance while being accessed by many users but can SATA SSD perform just like that?

I've heard good things about APC, but I've also heard that their newer models aren't really all that great. I've heard good things about Eaton, and so far I don't see many people complaining about them. To my knowledge their UPS's are also more common than APC's in enterprises and shit.
 Can y'all help me decide? I don't need something that big since I'll mainly be using it to provide a graceful shutdown for my NAS and keep it running if the power flickers. Both of the UPS's that I'm looking at are in my price range, and my main concern is buying one that has less of a chance of catching on fire.

However, all of the guides I can find online seem to require using a reverse proxy and a domain name to get Collabora working. Everything I've been able to find says that using localhost doesn't work.
 Does anyone know of any useful resources for connecting a Collabora server in a docker container with a Nextcloud instance in a separate container without using reverse proxies and domains? (I eventually do want to get into reverse proxies, but I'm doing this a little bit at a time, trying to get the most pertinent services up and running first) I am very new to Docker and running server services, so I haven't been able to make the logical leap over the gray area in all of the current guides I've seen.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was copying files from one drive to the Seagate drive in question (so I don't care about getting the data from that - I just want it working so then I can copy to it again). My computer completely froze (I was doing another copy with 2 other drives at the same time - those ones are fine though, funnily enough) and had no choice but to restart it during the copy.
 The main source drive was fine (thank goodness!) but the Segate 5TB not so much. I don't think it's a mechanical failure (in the platter / read/write head sense) - it spins fine, no beeping or any unusual sounds. But when I plug it in, it disconnects after a few seconds. When opening disk management on windows, it shows "Unknown Not initialized" for a split second. Given the circumstances of the failure, faulty cables wouldn't be a thing - although I tried different ones anyway to be doubly sure. So clearly some hardware issue, but I doubt mechanical - so I opened up the ensure (without snapping the clips somehow, lol).
 I put the hard drive inside a spare enclosure. Plugged it in - it didn't disconnect, but it wasn't showing up normally. I go on disk management, and I can see again "Unknown Not initialized". Again, I don't care about getting data from this, so I right-clicked on "initialize". It says "The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error." So definitely software will not work whatsoever. This leads me to believe I fried the control board / PCB, which provides an interface for the mechanical drive to communicate with the computer. Thus, I can't access the drive.
 The model of the PCB is 100721570 REV E.
 Am I correct in surmising that this is a PCB failure, and that I simply need to buy a replacement (AliExpress seems to be the only place I can buy this)? And apparently I need to copy the BIOS firmware from my original PCB to the replacement - is that true?
 Or is it really a mechanical failure?

As you can expect, I need to open a lot of ports so the client can access the proxy modem but I recently discovered a limitation of my router. Port forwarding rules are capped at max 36 rules. This is a big issue that I am trying to solve in priority as it's hindering my progress for deploying more modems and opening more ports.
 I am looking into 2 options here, either I can make an pfsence router myself or get something off the shelf like dream machine pro. I'm from India and getting server hardware here is a big pain in the butt. So I was thinking to go with dream machine pro.
 So does anyone know about how many port forwarding rules can we create in dream machine pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, thanks for reading -
 I'm in the UK and have been looking at reducing my power usage - I ditched my r710 last year and went back to 2 Gen8 microservers and things have been fine so far.
 I really wanted a Pi just for Pihole/DHCP/VPN etc but the prices and availability just made that a non-starter so I set about a little project.
 Dug out an RK3188 Android box out of a drawer (Chipset：RK3318 Quad-Core 64bit Cortex-A53) (4cpu @ 1.296 GHz) - it no longer functions as an android box as Armbian is installed directly to the eMMC. 
 Both Wi-Fi and LAN working (no Bluetooth or audio though but not needed for this use case as a network utility). GPU solid (GUI/Desktop performance more than enough, actually quite good) 
 Currently running:
 SSH Server Pi-hole Pi-VPN Samba Sonarr Radarr Docker, and Transmission. 
 Once configured for my LAN (used desktop GUI connected to a monitor with keyboard & mouse and a bit of SSH), it only needs the psu connected before logging in via SSH - GUI/Display output still working incase its needed though. 
 The power draw/cpu usage while idling are very low and even with all of those services running in the background - ram usage 815mb out of 3973Mb and System load of 5%. The best part for me is the power draw, which sits idle at about 4-5W. 
 I have photos of resource usage - neofetch, htop and the info given when logging in to the terminal - I'll make an imgur album if there's enough interest :) 
 It's taken me the best part of this weekend to do this - if there is enough interest let me know and I'll get some up on r/homelabsales if that's something that's allowed. 
 Thanks for reading 🙏

 I’m beyond upset. I lost photos of my father who passed away, my old pets, my whole life. I recently spent so much time downloading all of stuff from google and the like and kept this hard drive close like gold. Now it’s gone.
 I doubt anything can be done, but I’m just venting. What an absolute kick in the gut. I’m devastated.
 Edit: you’re probably wondering about backups- I had Duplicati set up to backup my whole server once a week to an S3 bucket but apparently it’s just been making empty buckets. I was too trusting of the notifications to try to look for myself. 
 There is no backup of this drive because of this, and I am aware it’s my fault.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 UK user.... I currently run an entry level Netgear ReadyNAS which is approaching near 10yrs old and is mainly used for "cold storage" and an i3 NUC as my mini-server / media centre, again that's nearing 10 yrs. I've had both from new and they have been brilliant but the media centre is starting to play up and I'm thinking it about time I start thinking about changing both into one combined machine with new drives. 
 My needs are not that heavy but ideally I would like to go down the TrueNAS Scale route with a 4U, 4-8HDD hot swap, short server style setup but I'm really struggling to put a decent combination of HW together to match the value for money of the QNAP TS-473A which would also meet my needs. 
 Further there is space, noise and consumption challenges with the server compares to the QNAP which further add to the cost to compensate. I don't know if the server style approach is more romantic than reality and if I should just bite the bullet with the QNAP and call it a day (despite my reservations on their poor poor security record). 
 My best HW combination so far is as below to keep the NAS under £900 (excl HDDs/SSDs):
 Motherboard: Asrock X570 Pro 4 - £170
 CPU - Ryzen 5 Pro 5650G - £150
 Memory - 32GB ECC - £150
 Server Case - 4U - £190
 PSU - Crosair - 550W - £100
 Various Noctua Fans + Ancilliaries - £120 
 ​
 In comparison the QNAP comes in at £750 + £100 for a RAM upgrade to 32GB ECC. Granted the server is a little more powerful but has other complexities...
 What HW would you go with to justify the server over the QNAP?
 Thanks in advance.

 I bought it last year at ionos and they were offering free ssl wildcart cert with each domain name purchased. Installalling them was a nightmare under debain server with proxmox running under the hood. I was starting from 0 and ask a lot of information everywhere to achieve 100% what i want at this moment.
 I went on the website to renew my order and i would like to know how much it will cost, I can't see how much money i need to prepare with taxes and how much money i need to get for the ssl sert / domain guard and renewal of the domain name. 
 I dont feel for renewing the files physically to something else. Can i avoid this part for the next 5 years to something else and mess with my website access security. i had problem making them works with the information i was seeing last time.

 The audio hats for the Pis have just been updated, apparently. Does anyone know of projects that could be installed on a pi and used with this for whole home audio? 
 I found this post which mentions a few projects but wanted to run it by this sub, first. https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/comments/lnhqpc/is_there_a_good_way_to_multiroom_audio_in_2021
 My preference is to be able to use Google casting, but if I had to use another solution, that's fine. 
 My main source for audio is Airsonic, though as the project is old and older now I may have to move to Jellyfin. I have tried Navidrome and generally find it inferior to Airsonic, with very little interest in using it as my main player. 
 My goal would be to be able to queue up music from my phone to play in various rooms throughout the house. 
 I like the ability to control each room's volume from my phone (like Google home, however their multi room audio has been terrible since they lost the Sonos lawsuit. I don't even bother with it anymore) as well as toggling rooms on and off. If it was possible to send different streams to different rooms simultaneously, that would be incredible. 
 Lastly I might be interested in Home Assistant integration, though it's not a requirement. The companion app is okay, but maybe not where I'd want to be managing everything from. 
 Obviously this is a big wish list, but I'd be curious to hear what you all are doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a newbie and I am planning on building a self-hosted NAS system for home use for the first time. After some research, I am thinking of buying a RaspberryPi4 (4GB), attaching an external SSD via USB, and installing OpenMediaVault on it. These are my requirements:
  
I need data durability
 I need data encryption
 I need to read/write data from various OSes (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
  
Would this setup cover all my points above? I am mostly worried about data durability. I guess I can plug in a secondary SSD and backup my data every now and then. But how do I prevent data corruption/bitrot in the long run? Please also let me know if you would recommend different hardware/software.
 For the sake of completeness: I don’t need to stream movies, I don’t need to store a lot of data (256GB is more than enough), and I don’t need high availability (in fact, I only intend to boot the system every now and then).
 Thanks!

 Side question: any website that can hold up a pretty decent amount of storage? Im currently digitally saving all the music I have such as cds and digital copies and using a 36 gig usb to contain everything. As of rn though it’s halfway full and I’m not half way done ripping every cd I got or storing everything. They’re all also just 360k MP3’s not even flacs. Was just curious if any websites other than google drive and megaz can carry about a terabyte

 I was having stability issues, and 1 ram stick was giving me "memory signal is too marginal" errors occasionally, and dropping out.
 So I put the stick with the marginal memory signal into the slot with the too high of voltage and the thing is stable now and that memory is working fine!

 A local shop has these used HGST 6TB HUS726060ALA640 drives for $40 a piece. The power on time shows around 2500 days and health 100%.
 The use case would be a TrueNAS server and the drives would be in ZFS RAID 6 or raidz2 (whatever they call it). I would have another backup of the files stored on another machine on 2 larger drives in mirror.
 I am wondering if this is a good deal or if I should stay away? What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for a GPU for my R730XD. The main purpose is gaming on a windows VM; mostly to stream VR games to my VR headset. I’ll also use it for some movie streaming and encoding.
 I’d prefer Nvidia for the software compatibility but it doesn't have to be. I need it to at least match the gaming performance of an RTX 2070. It also has to fit in a r730xd so it can’t be super massive. I can use server GPUs or consumer GPUs. If it’s a consumer GPU I believe it has to be a blower model (that pushes air out the back).
 I’m having trouble deciphering the nvidia server GPU naming scheme, and there are minimal user benchmarks submitted for server GPUs so I really have no idea what I’m looking at. From other posts I've read it sounds like server GPUs aren't great for gaming. But used parts can be at such large discounts that it may be worth it, I don't know.
 If anyone can recommend me a good GPU that fits in an R730/R730XD I would appreciate it.

 I could also set up multiple of such events. Some that just look up the weather in the morning before my alarm and tells me to take an umbrella if rain is forecasted.
 I can program all of this myself with eg. Selenide, but I'd rather use a solution that's already available to save time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have a crashplan for small business subscription and I need help in understanding the difference in sizes of my backup sets as they are presented in the:
 - Windows App
 - web application
 On windows App I see the "predefined" backup set occupying 3.1 TB while on the web application I see the (I guess) overall size at 2.4 TB (with a Selected at 2.9 TB that I don't know the meaning).
 Do you know why?
 ​
 ​
 on windows application
 ​
 ​
 on web application
 ​
 Second question: I bought a new bigger drive since the one where a part of my "predefined" backup set of Crashplan is filling up.
 Of course i need to migrate the files without reuploading everything to the cloud.
 May I safely refer to the guide here under the "Replace a drive" section?
 https://support.crashplan.com/hc/en-us/articles/8887084769037-Back-up-external-hard-drives-using-CrashPlan-for-Small-Business
 I found it not very clear for such a life critical task.
 Do anyone knows what I have to after connecting the new (empty) drive (a 6TB wd red)?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day all,
 I have a lab and I'm interested in expanding my ProxMox cluster to include a shared-storage option to make VM migrations fast.
 Setup:
 I have 3 matching systems (PX1, PX2, PX3) that currently have 500GB SSD drives in each. Running ProxMox 7.1.7.
 I have read much about Ceph, and also have Truenas option. I have done test migrations between PX systems, but these transfers take a while running 1GB Ethernet. I would like to add a shared storage cluster so the VMs will move faster.
 Do you recommend a Truenas ZFS external machine? Ceph on Ubuntu? I've also seen the Ceph setup inside ProxMox video that looks like it wants 3 matching drives, one dedicated for each PX system.
 What does the group recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I finally installed the new Google Drive app. It's definitely an improvement over the old Backup and Sync, however there's one thing I am unclear on, and I can't find the answer anywhere.
 You have the option to mirror certain folders from your computer. All Google says is that it will keep files and folders the same in both places. What I interpret this to mean is, while syncing is happening, it will keep track of where changes are made and then make the same changes in the other place. If you add a file on your computer, it adds it to the cloud. If you delete a file in the cloud, it deletes it from your computer. It knows where the change is made, and makes the same change in the other place.
 But what if I turn off syncing for 2 months, then I delete 2 files from my computer's folder, then 3 months later I turn on syncing again. How is Google Drive going to know whether files have been deleted from my local storage or added to Drive? Is it going to add the files back to my local storage or is it going to delete them from Drive? What will it use as reference?
 In the old Backup and Sync, there were options where you could tell it what to do in these scenarios. I messed up once and after moving a whole bunch of files from a mirrored folder while it wasn't being synced, I then resubscribed to Drive and it re-added all of those files, and now that folder is a complete mess, 2 years later I still haven't fixed it. I wanna make sure this doesn't happen again, but in the new app there are no settings to set a behavior for when it discovers changes that were made while syncing was off.
 Thanks, any input is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been using a Raspberry 3 as my media server since a while and everything was fine. 
 Sadly, some kind of power surge fried the board yesterday and it's at the worst period. I'm really short of options.
 Do you have a suggestion of what alternative SBC I could use as a media server? 
 I have a simple setup and simple needs:
  
Kodi
 HDMI out composite which 
 gets to a box which splits audio via optical output to my audio decoder and video through HDMI to my beamer
 
 the box will only be on when I'll be watching a movie, so basically 4-5 times / week for 2 hours maximum (I don't watch TV).
  
Thank you for your input

 Might be a silly question, but I'm not sure how this actually works.
 I currently self-host a Jellyfin that is also publicly exposed (with dense security) for the few cases where I need to use it from outside.
 It is being a domain name and is sent to my home through a VPS (no open port) (so the domain name points to the VPS IP).
 If I access this from my internal network, will the routing be smart enough to not go through the internet and directly re-route to my internal website, or will it still go through the VPS therefore being subject to my internet speeds ups and downs ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Goal is to use nginx Proxy Manager to reach different webservices under the same domain name on different ports. In this case I need a reverse proxy for vaultwarden to have Let's Encrypt certificate.
 From a WAN address I would like to reach my Vaultwarden Docker with https certificate by using a subfolder if that's possible.
 E.g. when opening https://home.mydomain.com/vw I'd like to reach my Vaultwarden which listens to port 7010 which is mapped to 443 within the container.
 This is what I've tried, without luck...
 Domain (Dynamic DNS): home.mydomain.com
 All docker containers are deployed with Portainer.
 Vaultwarden: IP 192.168.3.50 Port 7010 mapped to 443 inside container and 7011 -> 80.
 nginx Proxy Manager: IP 192.168.3.50, Port 80,81,443
 I've tried this Proxy Host config in npm Source: home.mydomain.com Destination: http://192.168.3.50:80 Block common exploits, Websocket Support SSL certificate assigned (Lets Encrypt), Force SSL, HTTP/2 Support
 with different custom locations:
 1) Custom location: /vw Destination: http://192.168.3.50:7011
 When opening http://home.mydomain.com/vw from a WAN adress I get a 404 "bitwarden...Page not found!..." page. I can load the bitwarden login page from the local network using http://192.168.3.50:7011 
 2) Custom location: /vw Destination: https://192.168.3.50:7010
 When opening https://home.mydomain.com/vw from a WAN adress I get 502 Bad Gateway....openresty

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On windows explorer when I go searching through my hdd, theres a long pause on every folder as it scans and builds a directory file tree from scratch every single time. 
 These folders haven’t changed in months, maybe years, theres no need to rebuild it so often.
 Is there a software / hardware combo that will place all the filenames and directories on a dedicated NVME for instant browsing? And then do a minor delta update as things change?
 I’m ok with the actual hdd files themselves being slow and taking a while to load.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been wanting a photo viewer for a long time now because of Nextcloud Photos bugs. The upload process is amazing from my Pixel 6 but the viewing process is laggy. And Facial Recognition completely broke in Nextcloud 25. My hardware is underpowered either, I have an i5-8250u running just nextcloud and a 3 player minecraft server.
 ​
 Every one of my services is authenticated with LDAP, if OAUTH is available that also works since I run Authelia (planning to switch to keycloak in the near future). It also needs to work entirely in a browser.
 I have checked a lot of the go-to image viewers with facial recognition and none of them seem to support LDAP login... some don't even support proper user authentication.
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I will be getting a new server (pre-built) in a few weeks and I would like to know a few things before I make that purchase official.
 Server specs:
  
Form factor: Tower
 RAM: 32 GB (4x 8GB) DDR4
 PSU: 1x 900W Hot plug, 80 plus gold
 CPU: 2x E5-2650v3 or 2x E5-2690v3
 OS: Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 LTS
  
Usage:
  
Running 24/7
 Personal cloud storage for films, videos, photos and other media.
 Running small website.
 Maybe some Minecraft modded server for playing with friends.
 Virtualization for testing but also daily using.
  
Cost: 601.99$ (2x E5-2650v3) or 759.02$ (2x E5-2690v3)
 - I would like to know how many cores do I need for server? I tried searching the Internet for some charts but didn't find anything useful.
 - Is Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 better or worse than Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3?
 - Is this configuration good or should I give up on it and find something better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is kind of a generic question, but I'm seeking advice for best way to secure a VPS (recently picked up a pretty beefy VPS for cheap on cyber monday). 
 So the issue I am running into is that when you install docker and deploy an image with the -p option, it's creating a related rule in nftables (running Debian 11). My original plan was to throw down ufw, forward only 80/443 and reverse proxy things I wanted publicly exposed (very little), and everything else would only accessible via wireguard. 
 I setup wireguard, got that working and everything then deployed a syncthing docker (to backup certain files from an on-prem box). I didn't create a rule in ufw for the UI, yet I was able to browse to it and that's when I starting researching and learned that -p option was creating those nft rules. This is not what I want; I want the syncthing UI to only be available to my clients connected to this VPS with wireguard, but I'm not sure how to achieve this. 
 Any suggestions? How are you running dockers on a VPS without exposing it all on the internet?

Now I am getting warnings about some certificates expiring and I've found that none of subdomains I've had for years now with Google are working however my duckdns link is still accessing nextcloud properly and when I use a browser to try the subdomains I'm getting that "congratulations you've successfully started the Nginx Proxy Manager". So if from a browser off my LAN my duckdns link is working what is causing my subdomains to not load. For example b***.***server.com and *****.duckdns.org both go to nextcloud but only duckdns loads it. 
 Thanks in advance for any help!!

I know I could use vpn or Tailscale but they are unable to install apps on their machines for one reason or another. So I’d like to open it up. I understand the risks etc. 
 I do own a domain name from an old website I used to run. It would be cool to use the domain from it It’s no longer indexed via google. I have Xfinity internet. 
 I did some researching and it seems that cloudflare tunnels would work but I can’t seem to figure it out. I think I set my dns up wrong from google to cloudflare. Idk
 Anyway is there a tutorial for this? Like something that’s detailed and step by step lol. I’m dumb I guess.

 I switched to Jellyfin a while back after having a minidlna based setup, because I fell in love with the UI. However it has so many bugs which go ignored by the devs, it's becoming more of a pain than a joy to use.
 What are people using for self-hosted movie collections? My other-half has gotten used to the netflix-style ui of Jellyfin, so something similar is high on the list of reqs!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a VM running some docker containers that I want to expose through a VPN. I have a VPS that I’m planning on using with a WireGuard tunnel and nginx reverse proxy. 
 Online I found some stuff about a DMZ, but it mostly mentions a separate host that isn’t physically connected to your internal network. 
 I have proxmox connected to an Omada switch, and then to my pfSense firewall…can I create a VLAN that blocks traffic from my internal network and put that on the VM? So I can connect to the VM from inside my network, but it’s only one way. 
 I know that using WireGuard makes it safer than port forwarding, but just trying to not wake up and my NAS and other servers are owned 😂. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 So I got my new to me S3500 switches. They came with a single 1050w power supply. 
 That thing is LOUD! I mean, I run older R710s and that noise is ok. Some of you prefer dead silent and that's ok, but I personally don't mind a bit of background white noise. 
 But these 1050s are on another level! My first thought was to fan mod it, but with the amount of heat coming out of that thing even with the switch idle makes me think it would overheat rather rapidly. The main fans in the switch slow down considerably after boot and they don't seem too bad. Of course, I can't really tell for sure with the PSU fan blasting away. 
 So looking around it looks like Aruba specified both 600w and 1050w power supplies for this switch. I have also seen mention of 350w power supplies in a couple of posts. However they don't appear in the datasheet for the S3500 so my assumption is they don't have enough power output.
 So for those of you that have run S3500s, is the 600w PSU a lot quieter than the 1050?

 Before doing that I wanted to ask, would it even noticeable save resources? Or will I introduce other disadvantages to my setup?
 If not what would be the best way to deploy it?

Basic Portable Drive 2 TB
 Toshiba Canvio Ready

Finally, I have one more option - buying this docking station to connect one of the internal HDDs (links below) to my laptop - I'm not sure if this is a good alternative or if it's reliable at all.

 WD Blue PC Desktop Hard Drive

Prior to that, I made a pfSense box (working LCD with lcdproc, etc.) on a XTM 5 which I then sold. I was able to flash a custom bios to my XTM 5 which allowed the pfSense install. My hope was to make another pfSense box out of this XTM 8, but I seem to remember some sort of issue with the serial port in doing this. 
 My question is this: Is there any practical use for this in my homelab? Is it possible to flash a custom BIOS that would allow me to repurpose this as a Linux box or is it a boat anchor?

 I currently don't have gigabit internet but I'm on a 300mb plan. I really don't want to spend money on electricicity running a dedicated computer. 
 All I really see are tp-link, ubiquiti and mikrotik? Which I've never heard of.
 Is the tplink er605 or 7206 decent and easy to use?
 Or like an ubiquiti edgerouter X ? 
 Nothing crazy expensive as we mainly use internet for heavy streaming and daughter does school work and xbox gaming. And I find stuff to fill up plex lol.

 DirectUs Contentful Contentstack Storyblok Sanity Strapi Webiny Payload CMS
 I decided for solutions which are self hosted, and also have options (ideally to publish pages and basic SEO). I have now landed on Webiny and Payload (taking into account self hosted and pricing - otcourse payload wins here).
 Webiny - they clarified on their security (firewall, code security scans), they support multi site, and also have a page builder - that are some strong plus points. And they aren't too expensive for users.
 Payload - of course free, but I see nothing about security and its too developer dependent (good for something's, but not if I want some content guys to run independent fast)
 My requirements: will be building a product comparison web platform, that will scale really fast in terms of visitors. And I will decide on hiring freelance developers, once I close on this.. But will also discuss with my devs later on the solution.
 Inherent Security, Multi Site / Language, User Authentication, Page Builder / Form Builder / File Manager, SEO
 Would be great if I can hear about people who are using these.

Alternatively, I could look to get an HBA card (pci express --> sata) but hear there are compatibility issues via this route. If you know of a good HBA card thats not too expensive, I'd love to hear.
 Any guidance here would be appreciated!

The Topton box (on bottom) is meant to run Proxmox and pfSense and be directly connected to the cable modem, but will live inside until setup and tested. One switch outside, and one switch inside the pfSense firewall. Also outside the picture, a Netgear GSS116E, two workstations, and a passel of the usual devices - meant to be well-isolated.
 Need to spend more time with pfSense and Proxmox.
 Have assorted DIN-mount gadgets and Meanwell power supplies. Also a couple of 3D printers. Might lose the wall-warts, and fabricate DIN mounts for the smaller network gadgets.
 Need to sort the mess of wires, and find a (much!) better mount.
 Again ... just a start. :)

I'm fairly technically capable, Linux is my favourite OS, I play with r-pi's a fair amount and I code in various languages - these days mostly code Python with a little C++. Run a few servers at home, love the command line, and have experience with cloud computing. With that said, I'm a bit of a jack of all trades but master of non but not afraid of the unknown.
 I instantly loved the flexibility of OHAB and was wary of the easy to use for non-technical people focus of home assistant. However, the java backend of HA makes me worry. Sorry if this is stupid but in the past I've had jvm version conflicts with stuff and am a bit wary of that but I don't really know if that is relevant. Do I need to even worry about that with HA?
 Additionally, whilst I love flexibility and tinkering, my current work is very full on so I don't actually have that much spare time so maybe "easy to use but less flexible" is better for me these days??
 Does anybody have any experience and words of advice?
 Finally, is there a good place where people talk about and share smart home setups and configs etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, So recently I have up-scaled my homelab from 4 docker containers/VMs to 15, and the expansion is only going to grow. I am having a lot of fun but I am also losing track of configurations and I would love to have some sort of centralized place to edit YAML files with a change history of sorts, to revert changes if I made an error. (currently I copy/paste into a new file, then use that if I need to revert back...)
 The YAML files are mainly on a private share for containers, that I access though my workstation, however I do have other services running outside of docker.
 I have netbox to keep track of IP's/Ports and so on, I have my documentation in order. However I do not have a good way to edit YAML files from a centralized area, and track changes or have a changelog. 
 I am very new to code, and code tracking, is there any container/service that I could use for this? Maybe Visual Studio? - I do not know if this will have what I need. 
 Thanks!

 I am in the process of backing up a complete music library from a website (+- 10000 albums).
 Here are always 2 options to download a flac and mp3 version. When the files are being downloaded individually they have always the same name whithout knowing if you have downloaded the flac or mp3 version.
 Filename.rar (contains 1 mp3 album)
 Filename.rar (contains 1 flac album)
 by using jdownloader 2 i always download both and append a number
 Filename.rar
 Filename_2.rar
 But i still do not know if the archive contains mp3 or flac.
 Is there any piece of software that can open the archive, see what extensions the songs have and append this to the filename?
 Filename.rar -> Filename_flac.rar
 Filename_2.rar -> Filename_2_mp3.rar

 My goal is to bring back at home my small server that is on a VM at OVH.
 I got 2 sff pc that I'll use for training and hosting.
 My switch is an old 15 year old 16 port Netgear. But I got an Aruba 1930 24 port on its way, so I can use the SFP+ port on my ISP router.
 Then next step will be to replace my hacked up firewall by a 10G capable one.

 It has two xeon E5450 CPUs, 6gb DDR2, a 1tb HDD and two 6tb HDDs.
 It runs portainer, Plex, pihole, motioneye (CCTV) and a small Minecraft server.
 We often have multiple TVs watching Plex, and we have 3 of us on Minecraft easily.
 I have a replacement ready just in case, but for now, this little machine has done me proud :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were a set of fairly cheap 1U GPU servers (the 1027GR line) on eBay a little while ago, one of which I picked up. I've been tearing my hair out for a few weeks trying to figure out exactly how to control the fans on these things; there's a lot of people out there with instructions on how to generically control fans on SMC servers with ipmitool and some people have details for X9 boards. In particular this STH article/discussion was very helpful indeed.
 ​
 I do think it's worth reading that comment and the original reference guide so I won't go into detail here, but what I did want to add was that the 1027GR seems to have unusual ID's for its zones. Specifically everyone usually says that the CPU zone is 0x00 and any additional cooling zones are 0x01, 0x02, etc. but on this server, (or at least mine) the zones aren't that at all. The zones for controlling the fans on my 1027GR-TR are the following:
  
0x10: CPU Zone
 0x12: Left GPU Zone
 0x13: Right GPU Zone
  
I know it's not the most useful post but I just wanted this to be out there for the next person searching around. Save them a bit of time and maybe keep them from tossing the server they bought because they can't get it quiet enough to use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I recently filled up my 40tb box that I keep in my local DC (1Gb connection from house to DC) and don’t have room for more drives so I ended up buying another box with the exact same hardware for another 40tb but isn’t in the same rack.
 Does anybody know how to go about making 1 80tb volume? I’d rather not pass the drives directly to the 1st host due to wanting to utilize the second host for processing power along with storage. 
 I’m using Windows Server Datacenter 2019 for my host OS (yes yes I know, it’s just so easy to join them to my ADDC and create permissions extremely easy).
 My initial thought was to use iscsi to pass the drives over a dedicated 1Gb link (no connection to the host would be more than 1Gb anyway) and just add them to the pool that way. Unless you guys have a better solution? Was thinking maybe clustering but it seems that you only get mirroring and not striping.

 First of all, sorry for my bad englisch german native here :) 
 I have a question about ZFS-Replication, perhaps someone have some infos.
 I have a Main-Storage System with ZFS and ECC RAM, the Second-Storage-System is running ZFS without ECC.
 In my opinion it's ok to run the second storage system without ECC, because the Main System have.
 The Second System is only for storing zfs-snapshot-replication as Backup
 Since i'm safe against bit root on my main storage after the data are writen to disk there is no chance to transfer corrupted data on my second storage system even without ecc on the second system.
 If i have a bit-root in ram on the second system while replication, zfs would check the different parity and resend it.
 Do I have a flaw in my thinking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 I want let you know that I have just released Update 1.6 for OpenBudgeteer, a budgeting app based on the Bucket Budgeting Principle. The Update contains some new features, optimizations and a few fixes. Check out the Changelog for the full list of changes. Below some highlights of the new update:
 Recurring Transactions & Split:
 It's now possible to manually split a Bank Transaction for multiple Buckets. In addition, if the amount assigned to a Bucket is lower than the Transaction itself, the remaining amount is displayed. Creation of Recurring Transactions has been added too. This is useful if you mainly add your Bank Transactions manually instead of importing txt/csv files.
 Themes:
 Themes are now supported. Visit Bootswatch for more details. To select a theme use the new option APPSETTINGS_THEME as docker environment variable or in the appsettings.json file.
 Import Page Redesign:
 Import page got some slight redesign. You can now switch between all steps in an accordion view, where each section is enabled depending on your input.
 As usual any kind of feedback is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I finally got back into the data hoarding game and got myself a new 16TB WD Element this past Black Friday. I have not shucked it and it is connected via USB 3. Benchmarks and file transfers show performance to be as advertised but I’m having an issue interacting with it in Explorer. I have SABnzbd set to transfer the ISOs after processing and I see the write rate to be > 200 MB/s along with other file transfer actions.
 Whenever I try to right-click and view properties on any folder and file on the drive, it takes > 5 or so seconds before the right-click menu comes up and another > 30 or so seconds before the info window comes up. Browsing is also a touch slower compared to my older and far smaller external drives.
 I tried leaving it as the only connected device, disabling shell menu extensions, Windows Search, services, and startup items and nothing has worked. The only time that the drive and Explorer don’t exhibit this issue is when I boot into Safe Mode. The drive functions as expected with right-clicking and retrieving folder and file properties as instantaneous.
 Other Explorer alternatives like Files doesn’t exhibit the same issue either so it definitely seems like a Windows issue.
 Anyone else has seen this behavior and might have an insight into this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have around 5TB worth of data that I want to consolidate into one place and want to know how would I go around and do such a thing.
 Short backstory, I had a system with 2 drives, a 500GB SSD and 2TB HDD. Bought a 1TB HDD during start of the pandemic for recording location of recorded meetings. Year 1 into Pandemic, 2TB HDD has an error and on a "Caution" status from CrystalDiskInfo. I was also planning to build a new rig that year so I bought one 1TB NVME SSD(not part of the situation), a 2TB Ironwolf HDD and 4TB Barracuda.
 I didn't want to use my new drives on the PC so I used two 1TB External HDDs to store the data. Then a year later the 1TB I bought at the start of the pandemic was in "Bad" condition, so I gave in and plugged my 4TB HDD and transferred my files. For some reason I also plugged in the 2TB HDD. Now all of them are in use. 
 So I did a disk analyze using WizTree and found out that I have half of my total storage full, not to mention earlier in the day I got an error that there was not enough space in my boot drive when I was saving stuff into there. 
 Now how would I go around completely copying over these files into a whole separate drive/drives, eliminating duplicates and make sure everything is copied properly, so that I can completely wipe my current system and basically start from scratch.
 I would also like to ask on what kind of storage I should use to store this on. I think it will be just a cold storage, with the occasional rummage through, but it might also be another dump place I can continue adding to. I don't want to delete any of the files, more of its a hassle rather than sentimental stuff, but there are stuff that I definitely want to keep there. I would also say that I don't have much money to put towards storing these. So I guess a solution where I can add on over time would be best.

 After setting up yet another laptop, I've had the idea of creating a small solution to be able to: 1. Install new devices from an image I created 2. Install software remotely 3. Remotely connecting to the devices when my "users" need help with anything that requires me to see their screen.
 I'm already pretty set on using AnyDesk for #3, but I haven't yet found a clean, easy (and free/inexpensive) solution for the first two points. I know of OPSI, but from everything I know it's complicated to set up and would require me to implement a VPN for all the client devices.
 Do any of you know of any software that could help me achieve my goal? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 Only snag i hit is that you have to get the tailscale package from their unstable branch because the funnel features are not on stable branch yet.
 I really hope they dont go down the same route as cloudflared and banning media from the service

 TLDR:
 I think that somehow port/channel 3 on the first port of my LSI 9240-8i is bad. Swapping breakout cable results in the same sata port being bad.
 Has anyone else ever seen this type of failure mode? Is there a recommended way to test all the channels/ports on it?
 Key system info:
  
It's been up and happy for over a year.
 I'm using a LSI 9240-8i in IT mode as an HBA
 I'm using 3 x 14TB WD drives all attached to a single SAS SFF-8087 to 4x SATA Cable
 1 x Parity disk and 2 x data disks

 I purchased a Storinator Q30 case and are looking to buy components for it ( CPU, RAM and MB)
 I have 2 * lsi 16i cards and an 10gbe card that will be put into the computer aswell.
 Storage i have 5*10tb and 5*18tb with 20 more slots in the case empty, so a build that can handle all the pcie lanes ( im counting 20 lanes) 
 Was thinking to get an ASUS PRIME Z690-P D4 (DDR4) and Intel Core i9-12900 together with 128gb ram but not sure thats the best path to take? read that QSV is favored because of plex and HW transcoding
 The OS im going to be using for this build is going to be Unraid as im going to run some stuff besides plex. nothing that cpu heavy. ( pihole, *arr´s, grafana. etc) and were wondering if you guys could give me suggestions of what path would be the best to take. cost wise, not really any limits.
 ​
 thanks in advice!

 The worry is the availability of a reader 10 years down the line in order to transfer the data onto something newer.
 The issue is I'm on budget and I just can't buy a NAS with data redundancy RAID and stuff right now. About half if not more of my data isn't changing so it might work if I go with write once disks.
 If I do choose this option ... I have lots of HDDs already, I'd like to know some more details about Blu-Ray in terms of reliability, like DVDs would randomly get bad sectors no matter how well you cared about them (or maybe I just had cheap disks?) I would get 1 broken disk per 10 disks in a brand new fresh DVD pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I want to finally upgrade from my current system (Z87-G45 motherboard, Intel 4770k, 32GB DDR3) and build a new system. 
 I also want to stop paying for Dropbox and have my own NAS that replicates that functionality as well as be a media server to stream my owned content. 
 So, I was thinking of just reusing my current system for the NAS, but here are the drawbacks from my understanding: 1 GB Ethernet on motherboard, no built-in WIFI, and no NVME slots (does have MSATA though). 
 I could buy a 10G LAN card (100 dollars) as well as an adapter card (15?) to be able to use an NVME drive for caching. Or, I could sell the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and AIO combo and use that money to build the cheapest newish system using a motherboard that has at least a 2.5G LAN port. 
 I have never built a server nor have had any kind of network storage before, so this is all a new experience for me. 
 What would you do or recommend me do?
 Any advice would be appreciated, including which OS/software system to use!!!

 At the this point, I’m not sure what happened. Any advice is helpful but from what I’ve seen, these devices tend to have this issue.
 Also I did verify the subnet mask and ensured that the static IP I set was in range.

My original network was [Technicolor modem > Netgear Nighthawk router] and now I would like it to be [modem > switch > AP]. When I do this however, I can't access the switch or AP because I don't have an Ethernet port to route through the switch. It does broadcast an SSID but I have no clue what the password is. To get around this, I setup [Modem > Router > Switch > AP], setup a Unifi Console and got everything working. I then tried to remove the router with the now configured OS console, but when I do this it continues broadcasting the SSID I setup and the password is correct, but it won't let me connect back to the AP unless I have the router plugged in. It just says it's connected, obtaining IP, then disconnects like it was never even trying (Android). Any idea why I can't bypass the router once the new AP is configured?

 About half a month ago, a friend sent me a link to a heated discussion on reddit. So I found the reddit self-hosted forum, and there were many comments about memos. The most mentioned one was dark mode, so we did our best to make a usable and readable version of dark mode.
 👇 Here is the new version of memos with dark mode. Please enjoy.
 Dark mode in memos v0.8.1
 BTW. Personally, I really like services that support self-hosted, like trilium, mastodon and so on. From the first day when I created the repo of memos, I decided that it should be permanently free and open source, and mainly support self-hosted. In this way, most developers can easily deploy their own note-taking service locally or on their server.

 Since one hdd usually only uses 150-200mb/s even with sequential write a 3g connection per drive should be more than enough. So my plan was to just get one 12g 16drive hba (like the lsi 9300-16i) and then use sas expanders/splitters. (Current plan to use them in four 10 disks each raidz2 pools)
 What would be a good option? Most of the ones i found are just 6gb
 Any advice on whats the best/most cost efficient way to achieve this setup when every drive should be able to utilize its full speed?

 I have a question to r/DataHoarder's.
 A lot of people is downloading stuff to 'preserve' it or 'not to be lost'. Why then not use IPFS for storing them ? It seems to be perfect solution for preserving data in a way that is 'not lost' (multiple redundant copies kept by people who want to provide it).
 I know there might be some copyright restrictions that prevent sharing, but a lot of people are keeping 'free' software like Linux ISO etc.

 I use VMWare Workstation to manage them all.
 I was wondering if it was worth having one ProxMox hypervisor VM and running and managing all the other VMs through that?
 I have my reasons for not wanting to do a bare-metal PM install right now, so was wondering if there would be an advantage to this method? Easier management etc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Homelab! First time poster, long time reader!
 I am trying to plan out a build for the following function:
  
Plex/Jellyfin Server (2x 4K stream at the same time)
 Nextcloud
 Webserver
 Seedbox
 Try to minimize power requirements as much as possible. 
  
Expecting to run about 50-60 docker containers for various apps and development. 
 I already have the following parts:
  
2x 1TB SSDs M.2 NVMe for OS (RAID 1)
 4x 10TB HDD SATA 6 for Media server (RAID 10)
 4x 8TB HDD SATA 6 for Webserver/Nextcloud/Development/Database (RAID 5/1/10?)
 
Large server case with 8 drive bays
 PCPartPicker Part List
 
  
 Type Item Price 
  
 CPU Intel Core i5-12600K 3.7 GHz 10-Core Processor $249.99 @ B&H 
  CPU Cooler Vetroo V5 52 CFM CPU Cooler $34.99 @ Amazon 
  Motherboard ASRock Z690 Pro RS ATX LGA1700 Motherboard $158.99 @ Newegg 
  Memory Corsair Vengeance LPX 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR4-2400 CL16 Memory $127.99 @ Newegg 
  Power Supply be quiet! Straight Power 11 550 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply $119.90 @ B&H 
  Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts   
  Total $691.86  
 
 ​
 Questions/Concerns:
  
Please let me know your thoughts on this build?
 Should I use RAID 5 for Webserver/Nextcloud or is it better to use RAID 1 or RAID 10
 Does it need a more powerful CPU? more RAM?
 Will I need a video card for the media server?
 Do I need a motherboard with multigig ethernet port or will it be more cost effective/better to just purchase a separate card with 10gbe or SPF+?
 I also have a 1000W power supply that I can use instead of this 550W, but Im not sure if the electricity cost will be more with the 1000W vs the 550W in the table above?
  
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently setup wireguard via PiVPN and a Pi4B. It works but speeds are a bit lacking. My home connection is 1000Mbps down and 100Mbps up. I'm getting speeds of about 30Mbps each way when WG is running on the Pi.
 Have tried PiVPN via two proxmox nodes as lxc and VM (J4125 and i5-6500t) and I'm getting about half the bandwidth that the Pi is giving me.
 I've played with MTU and that doesn't help.
 Is there a better way set WG up?
 OpenVPN is an option but most likely yield worse results so hoping WG will pull through.
 Iperf3 results are Gb each way. Have iperfed to an online server too and have got 500 down 80 up from the pi so I'm sure there is room for improvement 
 Any ideas / tips for a struggling soul?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought one of these at the $109.99 price (about $118 with tax, delivered) to add as an 8th drive on a DS1821+. After Black Friday it is now back up to $119.99:
 https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Blue-Hard-Drive/dp/B09KMGQG5Y
 All other slots are populated with a mix of helium and non-helium 8TB drives, all MyBook and EasyStore shucks. I could not find any information on the Internet regarding whether this drive would honor the disable head parking command. It does.
 The warranty was advertised as 2 years. WD warranty checker lists the warranty as 3 years.
 This WD80EAZZ arrived with idle3-tools reporting head parking at 80 (8 seconds). This drive honors the idle3-tools command to disable head parking. I ran idle3-tools via direct sata connection from an Ubuntu 20.04 server.
 To do this from Ubuntu:
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install idle3-tools
 sudo fdisk -l (to list what disk label your WD80EAZZ is set at)
 sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 (verify that drive respond to the idle3 command, and lists the parking time as 80)
 sudo idle3ctl -d /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 (you should get a "head parking disabled" message)
 Shutoff the computer. Fully poweroff the drive. Reboot and run
 sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 ...to verify that the head parking disabled setting survived poweroff.
 This drive appears to be mechanically identical to the white label non-helium EasyStore/MyBook drives. But, it does arrive with head parking set to 80.
 This drive seems like a steal at this price. I had 2 4TB Reds fail within the warranty period. Due to the failed Reds, I gave up on Reds and started buying white label 8TB drives. I have had zero white label drives fail so far. I am sure one white will fail tomorrow.

 While most systems focus on the web (which covers almost all platforms) unfortunately, for someone like me who enjoys watching Youtube on TV, I'm stuck watching obnoxious unskippable ads the from the Roku Youtube app.
 I've had enough, that's why I created Playlet: a Roku TV app that integrates Invidious and SponsorBlock, so I can have the watching experience I needed.
 Find the repo here https://github.com/iBicha/playlet - v0.5.0 just released!
 I created this app for my own use, but I thought maybe few folks here might find it useful (honestly I don't even know who would be interested outside of this sub).
 It's in a usable state, but lots of features are on the roadmap, and I'm only getting started.
 If you do end up trying it out, I would appreciate any feedback!

 Thanks for doing the work for me!
 Edit 1: someone said i should try using a neodinium magnet on the floppy disk, my metal chair flew across the room but the floppy disk is still dead
 Edit 2: someone told me to check how the drive sounds when it reads the disk, sounds like vrrrrrrrrrr, skrrrrrrr, krrrrrr then vrrrr again
 Edit 3: someone told me to use cloud to backup my data, i don't know how to reach that cloud whilst carrying all my disks
 Edit 4: someone said i should use DSDD, i don't like DS games, no thanks!
 Edit 5: got told that diskettes sometimes get dirty and i should try licking it, tastes like TV static, 1/10 never trying again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My guess: the answer is no (but I am still happy to hear your thoughts).
 I have somewhat around ~20 IMAP email accounts (more like ~50 when you count all the aliases) with different domains, servers and whatnot. It's always a hassle when something changes to also update my email clients on various computers, smartphones and so on. Also: I have a laptop for work on which I don't want to install a private email client. 
 The obvious answer to my "problem" is to have a webmail client which has access to all my IMAP mailboxes ... but I am not sure if I am comfortable with putting a service out there that can access all my personal data. I have basic knowledge of IT security and high respect of selfhosting critical applications on internet-connected machines. 
 As convenience is always kinda opposed to security, I guess, my question is: how big is the risk when using something like RoundCube on a VPS? Can I easily harden it to a degree that it is still comfortable to use but also secure (enough)? How can I test security and monitor dangers like automated attacks or hacking attempts? Is it a good balance between secure and convenient to not host on a public VPS but on a sever that is only reachable via VPN/wireguard/tailscale...?
 TL;DR: How would you set up a webmail client that has access to all your mailboxes in a way that makes you feel safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve currently got four Hik CCTV cameras, segregated on a VLAN with no internet access, and I’m utilising Frigate with Home Assistant for mobile notifications. This all works great. 
 I also have an intruder alarm, with sensors round the house/office/garage, but it’s a traditional alarm that I have to pay £100 to a company to keep it running. 
 I’m wondering if there’s a better solution where I can rip out this alarm system and install something else that doesn’t require a company to maintain it.
 For requirements I’d say:
  
Ability to arm different zones. With the current system, I can arm the downstairs, upstairs, garage and office independently or altogether. 
 Ability to arm/disarm from my phone
 Notifications when the alarm is tripped, whether I’m at home or away. 
  
Any suggestions?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hej,
 I just build my first home server. I have a lot of experience with Docker and web development, but I got few questions on the architecture I would use on this homelab.
 I'd primarily use it for hosting my personal website (portfolio), use it as a NAS (for video editing and general file sharing - locally and over the internet (maybe nextcloud and something else?)), torrenting, media (probably Jellyfin), deploying dev builds of websites I'm working on and intercepting DNS traffic / ad-tracker-blocking. 
 ​
 Hardware:
 CPU: Ryzen 4500; 
 RAM: 16G; 
 GPU: GTX 10603G; 
 Storage: SSD128G, HDD4TB; 
 ​
 I'd love to hear your software recommendations and tips, because so far I've got an Ubuntu Server with nothing. What software should I use for my desired use cases, what GUI would you recommend? Niche tips and tricks?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
 I'm scheduled to move next year to another continent (11hr plane flight away) and would like to keep a backup of my data at a family members house. This is to store my personal data/linux ISOs etc and is purely for my benefit. Unfortunately, there's no one who can maintain the system in my abscence & I dont have a concrete plan on how often I will be back in my home country.
 So, the question is, how much maintenance does a 6disk array Truenas system need with new drives?
 I realise this question is subjective as everyones 'milage may vary' and no guarantee our experiences would be the same.
 My estimates are:
  
consumer nas drives last around 3 years from new
 sometimes more, sometimes less
 system would be running z2 so if a drive fails then Id shut down the system and consider my options.
 Ideally, if scrubbing has issues, SMART detects issues then I'd want to replace the 'bad' drive
  
Question1. Is it a bad idea to consider having data off-site without anyone to maintain it? Does more drives=more maintenance? 
 Qu2: i.e I could 3 larger drives in Z1 or 6smaller drives in Z2, does one option (typically) require more involvement in replacing faulty drives on average? 
 I would of course be able to access the drive via ssh/web interface to maintain the nas remotely.
 Qu3: Finally, in the case that one drive has bad sectors in truenas - is there an easy way to work out which drive has the fault? In the case I had to relay this to someone on site - how do we work out which bad drive out of the 6 is the bad one? 
 Thanks for your advice.

 I've rethought my design for my next nas (Truenas scale) and am contemplating using 6 x4TB drives via Raid-Z2. I'd like to re-use a PSU I already have (I need to go inspect it otherwise I'd share with you now) and am wondering the following questions:
  
How much PSU wattage do I need?
 I heard somewhere that molex converters to Sata power is bad. Is this true?
 Is there a 'gold standard' of how to power 6 drives using a typical consumer PSU?
  
Thanks all for your input.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 unfortunately I have a strange problem on my Proxmox box (but probably it is not related to Proxmox itself). The system keeps adding a wrong IPv6 route. When I manually remove the route or reconnect the LAN-cable everything is fine for a few minutes. After that the wrong rule appears again and I have no clue what is adding the rule over and over again.
 The wrong route leads to no IPv6 connectivity across VLANs.
 The affected interface is eno1 which is connected to a switch access port that is associated to VLAN10. eno1 gets an IPv6 address as intended (":d910:"/"cc10" is my marker for: DHCPv6 in VLAN10):
 https://preview.redd.it/4n9v24jlsj3a1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95c42c7fa8f76989be23ff88e835c2a6129cdf9
 And here is the wrong route that keeps popping up. The prefix ":d920" is only handed out in VLAN20. eno1 should never see this! Removing this route leads to working IPv6 connectivity, but the route keeps reappearing.
 https://preview.redd.it/ta0hl7ossj3a1.png?width=1514&format=png&auto=webp&s=c05e1b4c16e59552469d0f13fc13616204189c65
 I also checked with rdisc6 if eno1 does see any wrong router advertisments. But everything seems to be fine (only ":d910:" appears):
 https://preview.redd.it/wfoby506tj3a1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=54f9ac05160de845d7a03e05751b55d9e8244d77
 I'm really desperate as I'm trying to debug this for 1-2 weeks now. I have no clue what I could check next. Any hint/advice is highly appreciated! What keeps adding the route and how can I fix the root cause?
 Thanks for reading!

 I have an old pc that runs docker and manage it through portainer. Looking at lots of YouTube video's how to savely expose my Nextcloud instance. Well, I found a very interesting option called Cloudflare Zero Trust. No need to open ports on my router and use a proxy for save connection.
 I have setup a tunnel with a subdomain nextcloud.mydomain.com with service HTTP and url 192.168.x.xx:8080. After that created an application that bypasses my home ip. Now I can access Nextcloud via http://nextcloud.mydomain.com. Till now I get it and works, but my question is...
 Is using HTTP a bad thing? Is the connection between the browser and cloudflare HTTPS and between cloudflare and my server HTTP?
 Hope someone might explain a bit more and if there are any tips how to improve the setup. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL/DR: can you look at my list of components below for a NAS/PleX server for <5 simultaneous streams with hardware encoding to be built in a 4U case with space for 100TB+ of storage and let me know if it all looks good for my use case?
 ---
 Hey everyone!
 I’m looking to build my first NAS/server and I’d love to get some build help. I’ve built computers in the past and have some technical knowledge, but nothing compared to this community. So, here’s what I’m looking to do:
  
NAS - I’m a video editor by trade, mostly 4K. I want a 100+ TB NAS to house archive files, and/or working files (if possible). I will hardwire my workstation to the NAS.
 PleX - I have a small-sized (<50) digital blu-ray collection and other digital movies in compressed formats that I’d like to house on my server and give access to close friends and family. <5 streams at once. Yes to hardware encoding.
 Experimentation - As this is my first introduction to all of this, I’d love to experiment with things like Radarr, Sonarr, home automation, Pi-hole, and I’m sure other things in the future.
  
The hardware I've picked out can be found here or outlined below:
 ​
  
 CPU Intel Core i5-11400 
  
 Motherboard Gigabyte Z590 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA 1200 
  Memory G.Skill Aegis 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-2666 
  Power Supply Corsair RM550x (2021) 550W 80+ Gold 
  Tiered Cache Storage (2X) TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB M.2 
  OS Drive Kingston NV2 500GB M.2 
  Storage Drives Seagate IronWolf Pro 18TB 7200 RPM (or 20TB depending on prices at time of purchase)

 However, I’m paranoid about catastrophes such as fires and such, so I’ve been looking for a way to at least save one image on an offshore cloud. 
 I tried Macrium Reflect with Microsoft Azure, but my 20mb/s upload speed against a 400GB image file made uploading basically impossible. 
 I’m not sure what to do. My other alternative is to occasionally back up a single image to an external HDD, and hide that in a fireproof safe or something, but even that’s not foolproof. 
 Ideas? Ideally not expensive ideas lol.

 I'd like to upgrade to an i5 8500T, but they are pretty rare in my region and quite on the expensive side, I found that the i5 8400T is almost the same performance wise.
 My question is, will a i5 8400T work instead of my G4900T ? both are Coffee Lake S
 Also can I use a non T version of the i5, the power supply is 65W so probably not ?
 Thanks !

 But it's
  
Refurbished (what are the chances it have issues?)
 Not sold directly by Amazon (Tech on Tech, high rated)
 Warning about import fees (just $30)?
 The "enterprise" branding (I'm an individual, but is that just better?)

 I would appreciate any guidance on best practices for cold storage of content. I generate content for projects which is stored on External WD drives. One drive per project with each project consuming 4-8TB of space. Roughly 2-3 projects per quarter. Consequently, I'm starting to get overwhelmed with the number of external drives living in a closet.
 There was a great video posted recently showing a migration to LTO which caught my interest. The size, weight and longevity of the LTO cartridges is very appealing but, wow, the LTO drive is pricey!
 Is the move to LTO worth the apparent pain and initial cost?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow datahoarders! I need your help.
 What programs do you use to sort out photos/videos/media? I’ve been doing a multi-year project where I’m gathering all of my family photos, old and new. I follow the 3-2-1 backup plan to make sure nothing happens in the task of gathering and digitizing old photos, but now I have thousands of pieces of media that I need to comprehensively organize that will make them easy to find and view. I’ve looked online but a lot of the programs don’t seem to be what I specifically need, lacking some feature. 
 The key features I want out of the organizing software: 
  
Tagging system (e.g. being able to search for a photo/group of photos by date/person/event/place/source at the same time) 
 
A timeline view (not really needed but would definitely be awesome.)
 
Ability to mass rename media in an organized way (eg. making a group of photos ‘2021_03_08-baseball-game-pics-cannon_rebel’ 
 
Lossless conversion (might just need another program for this one) / lossless viewing after import 
 
Supports ranges of file formats (PNG, JPEG, HEIC, GIF, etc.)
 
 The program doesn’t need cloud options/storage available or built-in photo editing, but if it happens to have it then that’s an added bonus. 
 In total when I’m completely done with the project, I’m expecting probably about 200-300gb of media. 
 I’m open for both free and paid programs, just let me know a good one, thanks!
 Edit: Currently using Windows 10

I'm having some users on my network trying to access resources and when they receive the login portal, after entering their username it never transitions to allowing them to enter their password. There are no errors in the web browser itself and there are no errors reported in the logs on the server. Interestingly, if you follow the same exact procedure in a private window it works fine. Can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work in a regular browser window. I will also note that this is a issue pertaining to just firefox. But it is happening across several machines. I have tried deleting cookies and cache but both do not fix this problem. Has anyone seen similar Behavior?

 I know that SSDs have a limited amount of write cycles and that typically larger SSDs usually last longer due to more space for load wear leveling, but I don't really know how much is too much given the size of an SSD. TRIM is also enabled.
 Given the usage my SSD sees in about a week on average (see image), should I move the download location to one of the other internal hard drives and/or get a larger SSD? 
 Thanks in advance!

 My question is would the write speed of an SMR drive throttle the 1gbps connection I will be using to fill the said drive?
 I can format the drive after each dump. I heard that helps with speed for SMR drives.
 P.S.
 It has to be SMR because I need a 2.5" drive without an external power supply and a 4TB ssd is just too expensive for me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im trying to configure nginx proxy manager in unraid but when I go to the url it shows a page from my router saying I dont have internet (not true if I try to open a website everything works fine). 
 The ports i setup are the following:
 Public Port 443 --> LAN port 18443
 Public Port 80--> LAN port 1880
 These are forwarded to the ip 192.168.0.220 the ip of my server
 and when I try to enter in the proxy I get redirected to http://192.168.0.1/interception.html
 What im doing wrong?
 Dont know if it matter but im using IONOS for the domain.

 I have an old pc that i want to make into a home lab nas that runs 24/7 and is set up to be able to do the things in the title plus maybe pi hole if that isn’t complicated. I want to be able to remotely control it with my main pc if that’s possible/necessary.
 Is there a guide or video or something that might be able to help? mb if these are dumb questions or if i overlooked something simple

 Ideally, this would be a database to which I can add entries (the albums) and hopefully add custom fields (release years, record labels, where to buy it, etc.).
 Is there something I could make fit this need?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. As the title suggests, I am trying to migrate to unraid. I'm currently in the process of disassembling my backup from DrivePool, but I need a plan for when I am done.
 Is there any way that I can format these backup disks in Windows such that they will play nicely in unraid, after I wipe my NAS array and rebuild in unraid, in order to move all the files from the backup to the unraid array? NTFS does not seem to be a great option.
 Edit: I realize now I should have mentioned this, but my main problem is that my backup is not a server, but a JBOD with SFF cables hanging out the back that I then plug into the soon-to-be unRAID server. Maybe I should think about migrating my backup to an actual server before performing this migration.

 I found NextCloud as a potential solution.
 I have no idea what it takes to get anything like this set up. I currently have about 4 TB worth of data that I need to store/access remotely. Any recommendations on hardware or just in general for getting things set up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This topic has been discussed many times, but i didn't find anything specific to my situation.
 I would like to create a RAID1 with 2 sata drives (same brand, model,capacity). My objective is to have this raid accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu, wich are located in 2 other separate drives. So i am not trying to boot from the raid, i am just using it for storing data. I know that the easy solution would be to go for a real raid controller card, but im trying to find out if it is really necessary to spend more money. As for the software raid option, for what i've understood you can't do such a thing and make it accessible from both linux and windows, but correct me if im wrong.
 So now i am thinking about doing it using the built-in motherboard controller, but every discussion i've read comes to the conclusion that you shouldn't do it because:
 1 - If you change motherboard you won't be sure your next hardware is gonna read the data.
 2 - motherboard implementations of raid usually use CPU resources.
 3 - motherboard implementations usually dont have powerloss safety features, and this could mess up the data. 
 My questions are:
 1 - Are statements (1) and (3) true also if you have a RAID1 configuration? I am saying this beacuse since it is just a straight copy i would assume the way the data is written isn't that cryptic and i can read it easily if one of the 2 corrupts(or if i change motherboard).
 2 - Do all motherboards do this "fake" raid? In my case on the manufacturer site explicitly says that it supports RAID 0, 1 and 10.
 3 - Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to do?

 Thanks in advance

 I have 3 x 8tb SAS 4kn drives which were removed from servers due to some minor errors, i would like to use them as my private storage in raid 5 configuration. By private storage i mean PC, i have checked already 2 controllers ( adaptec 7805, dell perc h200) which propably dont support 4kn drives, would anybody reccomend something that would be cheap/reliable, for now i have found Dell 9265-8I  that i think supports 4kn and its around 50$ .
 For now these hdd when connected to my controllers show unsupported device and pc doesnt find them - through controller i can see model number and nothing else

 I am a bit perplexed, and concerned if this could be a faulty product, like actually a 12TB drive with malfunctioning firmware to report itself as 16TB.
 This is my first time buying a large capacity hard drive, so I posted my question here, hoping to get some answers from more experienced people.
 edit: forgot to mention the box front sticker said 16TB while the barcode sticker said it's a 12TB model

 I want to ask between the two, which one is better to retire aka backup? I wouldn't mind keeping the faster and older one, but if it deteriorates along the way and risks to die, wouldnt it better to retire and leave it alone where it just sits there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am new to self-hosting, but I am learning, and I am very glad that I found this sub.
 ​
 A friend of mine asked me for some advice that is beyond me, so I am bringing the situation to you fine folks. He has an account with GoDaddy that provides him 100 email addresses (and I assume the web site) for his business. He has had this for a long time, but recently GoDaddy has changed and has become way more expensive than what he is willing to pay.
 ​
 He asked me how difficult it would be to set up an email server in his home to handle the email for his business. I looked over the intro post for this sub, but as I am just getting into this sort of thing, most of the stuff on Github was beyond me. Is this something that could be self-hosted? I should say, is this something that could be self-hosted and administered easily? I have some background with IT and networking, but he doesn't have any, and I don't want to get him set up with something that is going to turn into a full-time job for me, you know?
 ​
 I appreciate any help/advice, web sites, etc.
 ​
 Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. I definitely need to get more information from him (how many accounts currently, how much mail sent/received per month on average, what his budget looks like, etc), but I will definitely bring your thoughts to him and see what he thinks. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I currently have a server with : 1 x 8TB HDD Ironwolf for Data, 1 x 10TB HDD Red for Backup, 1 x 500GB M.2 Crucial for Boot Drive and Linux VM, 2 x 4TB Ironwolf and Red (i still don't know what to do with them for the moment) , 1 x 250GB SSD Sata Kingstone (Old boot drive no use for the moment),
 Now i have my 8TB Backup as sync in my 10TB , 500GB + VM Backup in my 10TB, 4TB Ironwolf backup in my 4TB Red,
 I would like to know if its a good idea to create a partition on the 10TB. With the exact size as my 8TB to backup sync my 8TB in this partition like if i have exactly the same drive and create a partition with the space left to backup my Boot drive and maybe other thing.
 I will probably use the 250GB SSD to put my vm on this one. And backup this ssd with the boot drive backup (inside the 10TB)
 So the goal is to simulate a real drive and be able to see if the sync got the same size, improve the organisation between my 2 backup. Thats not a crucial feature is more a idea i've got recently. Thx for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Issue:
  
My partner just got a new iPhone, and has a ton of old photos on the old iPhone
 They want to be able to somehow view the older photos on the new iPhone without moving them over
  
Research:
  
I looked into this issue, and only found 'My Photo Stream' which appears to be a shitty way for Apple to force people to basically sign up for their Apple iCloud service.
 The problem with this is that you're only able to see the photos from the last 30 days which is obviously shilling towards having to buy an iCloud storage account.
 They also appear to be kind of limiting the service as well and it appears to be discontinuing in the near future, so this isn't even a long term solution.
  
Question:
  
With this in mind, I wanted to ask if anyone knew anything I can host on my local LAN file server that could automatically show an image gallery similar to the 'Photos' app that exists on iPhone itself? 
 I figured there's gotta be a way around this, and I will even pay for a stupid iOS app that would allow for this as well (once, not subscription based though etc).
  
​
 Me as the hardcore Linux / Android user cringes with this kind of scenario however you can't change Apple fans for some reason unfortunately. As much as I hate this scenario, I figured maybe someone might help me out and this would be a good reference for someone as well.
 ​
 Thanks!

 So far I looked at synology, qnap, and terramaster expansion units. Synology being quite expensive and terramaster is too low, is qnap expansion unit a good place to land? I have only two drives right now, but looking at 4+ bay for room to expand.

On a recent trip across the globe, i noticed that emby load times were pretty slow from very far away (>5000 miles) . This was not an internet speed issue as the internet was very fast and the server is on gigabit. Direct SSH connections to my server were also significantly slower. Struggling to scp files at 5MB/sec.
 What can i do to significantly decrease remote server latency when accessing from very far away, specifically for emby?
 - I just turned on cloudflare proxy while being careful to disable caching since video streaming is technically against their terms of service. I'm not sure if this will help but i assume so due to increased peering
 - Would a kubernetes cluster help? Has anyone tried creating a CDN with kubernetes? Or would this not help since volume data is still mounted far away?
 - Other cheap CDN services that people use / recommend?

 I was wondering if one of you who have the SFF variant of the OptiPlex 9010 or 7010 could tell me if it uses one of those slim laptop style optical drives, or if it has a full 5.25 bay.
 I'm blind, so I'm unable to see pictures of the unit, and I've found conflicting discussions online. I'm trying to figure out if I could use one of these brackets to install another 3.5 drive, or if I'd be limited to installing an SSD using something like this. If it uses a slim drive, I also need to figure out if I'd need any sort of power adapter to connect an SSD.
 Thanks

I am weary of any computer with proprietary BIOS without any updates running as main router, thus the question. Anyone?

However, as the title says, the two drives are not the same size; one is 6 TB and the other is 10 TB. What I initially thought to do is to create a two partitions on the 10 TB drive: one is the same size as the 6 TB drive and part of the storage space, and the other partition to be an extra general drive for media, game storage, etc.
 So my question is: is this a sensible setup? Should I just set up a storage space with the two drives without creating separate partitions? Is there a third option that I'm not thinking of?

 I want to do it because with OPNsense i'll able to:
 -Isolate Crypto miner from whole network(just in case)
 -Isolate IoT devices in one network and let HomeAssistant be bridge between SFW network
 -Isolate other devices in pools for easier troubleshooting 
 AP question
 Do you know AP that can broadcast network(3 networks):
 - 5GHz and 2.4GHz with same SID name
 - 2.4GHz hidden IoT network
 Its running :D

I would like to add a GPU to the server for gaming. I know I can't add anything too crazy and it has to be under 75W, but after watching a video by Craft Computing talking about the Tesla P4 I thought it would be a perfect fit for this server. Also they are really cheap right now compared to what they were a few months ago. 
 Since I'm still new, and this is my first time ever doing anything like this, I wanted some advice before I purchased anything. Is it a good idea to go with the Tesla P4 or should I use something else? Is there anything in addition to the GPU that I would need to purchase? I know I might need a fan for cooling, but is there something I might be forgetting? Also does anyone have this setup? Would it even be possible? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 I want to backup my google photos and videos, and I want to do it programmatically, ideally once a day at the end of the day. Problem that I'm facing is that all instruction for programmatic access to google photos using OAuth have a WebUI step where you need to click to confirm access. It's like they are built for me as a service provider that needs access to users photos and I ask the user to enter their info so my software can interact with their library.
 Does anyone know of a process where I can auth against my google photos, get the token and then manipulate my library without any UI interactions?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using BackBlaze for my emergency cloud backup for just under 5 years. As my data grew and I added larger HDDs to the system it seemed like a very cost efficient emergency plan. The original plan (with 2TB drives) was to back them up using a "toaster" drive. I'd keep a copy at work and a copy at the house and BackBlaze was the emergency plan. The "Toaster" backup went out the window in 2018 when it began to take hours using "eSata" as the drives surpassed 10TB.
 Six months ago it dawn on me (one of those Duh? moments) that I now have 33TB of data on the Backblaze cloud from my six 20TB drives. In the event of a catastrophic failure the only way Backblaze allows restoration is by downloading or a second option of selling you a USB drive that they will fill with your data. You can return up to 5 of these per year for credit.* In short, a complete restoration would take a significant amount of time in 8TB chunks, between mailings.
 I have now purchased a Synology DS1821+, which despite what it says does support Seagate Iron Wolf 20TB drives (I currently have it configured using six with SHR-2 redundancy and 1 hot spare. I'd still like to use a cloud backup but is Glacier any better at a large restoration than BackBlaze was? I'm probably paranoid, but I've lost data in the past and well, you know...
 ​
 *Prior to May of this year it was a 250GB drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real basic question I hope someone can answer for me to save me the buttload of time it would take to find out myself through experimentation...
 If you have a Dell server (e.g. R520) with an on-board RAID controller for the backplane, and the RAID controller does not support non-RAID configurations... 
 If you, as a workaround, were to set up each disk as a single RAID0 virtual disk individually, and pass the RAID0 VDs through to the OS, would the Filesystem on the physical disk remain mountable if later removed from the RAID controller?
 In other words: does the RAID controller do anything to the structure of the disk such that it can only be mounted by the RAID controller, or would it be identical to the same disk mounted by a SAS controller without RAID?
 I'm looking to use this workaround to mount disks to pass through to a guest OS, and want to ensure that I am not dependent on the continued operation of the host RAID controller to access and work with the data, so that if/when the host controller dies or is replaced with another device, I can just plug the drives in to another SAS controller and have them be recognized and mounted normally.
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. if I don't get an answer here I'll need to verify it myself by several passes of formatting and mounting and OSing and swapping 10TB disks between servers so that could take a while.... I'll post the results here if I do though because I'm not a monster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all, posted on /r/Ubiquiti, but I figured y'all might have some experience on the switch side: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/z8y6y7/uapachd_when_cold_started_with_poe_switch/
 I had a weird issue I was hoping someone could help with.
 In my house, I use a Brocade ICX6450 switch, which supports POE (802.3af and 802.3at). Indeed, I had figured out how to make this whole thing work before things broke after a power outage and I had to do my workaround again.
 I have two UAP-AC-HD APs and one UAP-AC-Pro. The Pro has no issues - I connect it to the switch, tell it to turn POE on, and it's immediately detected as 802.3af. Obviously also works fine with an injector. However, both of the HDs - when the AP has been disconnected for a while (e.g. 5 hour power outage), when it's connected to the switch, it's detected as "non-standard PD". When I connect it to an 802.3at injector, it turns on fine.
 Here's the strange thing - if I have it on the injector for a little bit of time (~5 minutes or so) then immediately plug it into the switch directly, the switch senses it as 802.3at and feeds it power.
 Has anyone run into this before? Or does this sound familiar to anyone?

What's up with that? Do all posts have to be approved by mods? Or am I just restricted because of my low karma (i'm fairly new to Reddit - started in August) or maybe because my profile was set to "NSFW"? (Not sure how/why - I don't remember setting that but I've turned it off now.) 
 It seems like I'm far more likely to get help if the whole community can see my post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was running Wordpress in 2 docker containers. It worked locally but I couldn't make it work using a Cloudflare tunnel so I tried restarting the containers and now I can't even run it locally - "Error establishing a database connection".
 My first thought was to just export the database and setup WP from scratch and import the db. (I know my way around databases a little.) So I used mysqldump to export it but when I open the exported file, the only post is the initial/generic "My first post". None of my posts are there!?!
 OK, I thought, let's try to fix the database connection. I looked in both containers (as well as the host volume) and found the wp-config.php file - but it has absolutely nothing in it about my database. It says "define( 'DB_USER', getenv_docker('WORDPRESS_DB_USER', 'example username') );" I'm pretty sure that "WORDPRESS_DB_USER" is a variable but it's not defined in the wp-config.php file. Where does it get the values for the vars?
 I'm starting to freak out, here. I spent a lot of time on a lot of posts and now I can't seem to find them anywhere. They can't be gone, can they? Just from restarting the containers? I'm obviously very limited in what I can do, here (partly by my limited knowledge and partly) because it's running in a container with no GUI and no way (that I know of) to run phpMySql. I *do* know the MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD but I can't figure out where to use them.
 PLEASE HELP!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I currently have a server setup as my NAS, but I would like to not use the onboard SATA ports anymore.
 I already use some kind of SAS2008 card (flashed to IT mode), with the two SAS ports used up to 8 SATA Hard drives.
 I'm now looking at SAS Expanders because that seems like the right option to add storage connectivity to my server.
 At first I found the Intel RES2SV240 wich has a total of 6 SFF-8087 connectors and external power since my motherboard PCIe are full or too small.
 I also found the cheap 03X3834 IBM LSI 6GB, but I would need a mining riser to power the card. 
 Finally, I found the Adaptec AEC-82885T. It has external power connection, but I would need to change my current SFF-8087 to Sata cables for ones that uses SFF-8643. One great advantage are the external ports which will be useful in the future.
 So currently my plan is to buy that Adaptec Card to future-proof my setup.
 Is there anyone with experience with the Adaptec card (or the Intel one?). I plan to use it with a TrueNAS Scale VM on-top of Proxmox (with the HBA pass-thru).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a artist and someone with a lot of reference image material and artbooks, is there anything similar to a self hosted booru in the sense of extremelly complex image tagging capabilities? like, instead of separating images per folder since some elements can overlap and be of interest (ex. images contain a relevant clothing type and also some kinda of hairstyle and pose), somewhere where you can search for automatically or manually inserted tags like: black hair, short, long, leather jacket, short sleeves, sitting, sipping tea, holding a bat etc... etc.. etc... because more often than not I need references for specific pieces of clothing, poses or hair styles and remember that I have something like that but not exactly WHERE it is, and end up losing a lot of time searching for the needed references. I liked the way paperless-ng tags everything so you can easily find needed documents by the tags, but it uses OCR and text, my idea is something similar but for image even if I would have to spend some time manually tagging the pictures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm not sure what the best backup utility would be for what I am looking for.
 My fantasy of backing up files would be placing everything in a single folder and having an automatic scheduled time each week/day for backups to be uploaded to a free and secure cloud storage service.
 The backup would be encrypted first so that if the cloud service becomes compromised my data may still have safety.
 Ideally if a crazy house fire were to occur my data being in the cloud could be restored and decrypted from a different location if my home computer were to melt. If it exists, maybe something similar to how Veracrypt handles encryption where only a password is needed to decrypt files.
 ---
 + Automatic scheduled backups (daily/weekly)
 + Cloud support for arbitrary (free) cloud services such as Mega, Proton Drive, etc.
 + Encryption of data and decryption via passphrase
 + Free or libre

 Thinking about maybe putting an 18U server rack in a storage area under the stairs?
 Wondering about how especially on exterior walls, if we add spray foam it will be hard to use old cable to pull new cable for future upgrades.
 Wondering if I should have conduit anywhere I will spray foam? This way if technology is significantly different in 20 years I can pull something else through and leave the spray foam intact? If so, are there key words I can search for to find good info about low voltage conduit?
 Wondering about larger conduit into the server rack are as well.
 I’m pretty ignorant. I mean, I’ve read a lot and think I have a plan but I have very little hands on experience. This may not be a typical question for here but I figured if anyone would know, you guys would.
 Thanks.

 For quite some time now, I've had 3-4 different hosts set up with Cloudflare Tunnels. Public hostname set to hit NPM instance, then handling all subdomains/subfolders/SSL from there. At some time last night, it all stopped working.
 I changed from wildcard to just base domain and pointed at insert dashboard here with Cloudflare and that works, but pointing a subdomain/subfolder to a different service does not. 
 I later updated a different domain name with my home IP and did the old school port forwarding 443 to NPM and that works. 
 So this tells me it's something with Argo?

 Reason:
  
to learn and play with technologies.
 to learn about virtualization
 I already know about kubernetes, but I have never provisioned a cluster myself. So the goal is to provision VMs and then make a kubernetes cluster on top of that.
 What will the cluster be running? I don't know exactly, maybe some bots, some self hosting, gitops testing, docker multi-arch building etc.
  
Important factors:
  
Noise
 Consumption
  
What I was thinking was to buy a Deskmini x300 with 64GB ram, 1TB SSD and a 5600g Ryzen. I think it should be enough for 4 VM k8s cluster (one master and 3 nodes) and also some space for other things.
 However, I am considering if it makes sense to buy a Ryzen 5700g instead. Going that way, it is going to be more expensive but I also fear about the two important factors above. I think I would have to buy a Noctua fan and on top of that, I am not even sure the deskmini x300 PSU can handle the CPU.
 I should also add that I want to run it mainly headless with SSH connection from my laptop. I am still not sure if I want to buy a screen, don't have much space in my office.

 I contacted them (that in itself was a bit of a hassle and took a while - this was a red flag and I really shouldn't have persued it after that). Eventually some guy named “K” (turns out this is the owner), responded and I sent him one of my VHS tapes to test out the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The domain registrar Namecheap offers hosting services as well.
 One of those service plans - labeled Stellar Plus (see here: https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared/) - allows users an "Unmetered SSD."
 From my research online, there is a limit to the inodes (I believe around 300,000) but if you theoretically compressed / split your files in a few tar archive(s) you could potentially achieve unlimited storage? Paying ~$70/month seems a bargain when it comes to that.
 If I actually considered this, I'd definitely encrypt the files before uploading (they have an FTP option, with unmetered bandwidth)
 So my question is this: did I find a bargain or am I barking up the wrong tree/have no idea what's up?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I just found this legal page on Namecheap: https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/aup/. From it's section labeled " Additional Acceptable Use Policy for Virtual accounts", it seems like the maximum file size would be 10GB based on their text. So, I guess the limit might be 3 petabytes? 10GB * 300,000 inodes (each archive would be 10GB)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently in my PC case there are 2x 6TB WD Reds (WD60EFRX), each about 5 years old, and they are quiet and fast enough for my needs. But they're getting old and running out of space. 
 Now I'd like to upgrade to something like 2x 12/14TB or similar, and when I checked some reviews for the newest WD Reds or Ultrastars, they're filled with people who complain about the clicking/PWL noises in idle. Which is this thump every 5 seconds in idle:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgOgrbRPOo
 That would bother me to no end, since my drives are bolt directly to the case and any vibration would be amplified. I don't mind a bit more noise when the drive is working, but not this constant Chinese torture. So are there any drives that are 12TB+ and still suitable for a PC case? All the "consumer" HDDs only go up to about 4-6TB.
 Choices would be: 
  
WD Red Plus/Pro or WD Ultrastar
 Toshiba Enterprise MG08/MG09 or Toshiba N300
 Seagate Exos X or Seagate Ironwolf
  
So any of these comparable to my old WD Reds 6TB? Obviously them being 5400rpm they are a bit quieter, but I don't think I would mind them being a bit louder when working, as long as they are quiet in idle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've recently started creating an managing websites, so now I have to setup mailboxes for my clients. I use a separate cPanel account for every clients, and use that to setup the mailboxes, and it is working fine.
 What is troubling me is that as a user I always assumed the content of my email messages was encrypted and hidden even to the system admin and didn't suspect I, as an admin, could access freely my client's mailboxes. I assumed this was why you send a link to ask them to set their own password. However, disregarding on how the password is choosen, I simply have to click "Check mail" in cPanel to access whatever I want.
 I understand this is because I'm using client's cPanel to set their mailboxes, but they would never be able to do the job by themselves, so I guess I have no other option.
 Unfortunately, when dealing with one particular client, I also assured them I cannot access their email accounts. Now I'm pretty sure this is not even legal, and it looks like a huge privacy flaw to me.
 So, how can this be normal?
 Is there a way to avoid being able to access my clients' mailboxes?
 Thank you very much!

 I want to set up paperless ngx this weekend, did a lot of research and looking forward to use it.
 BUT ... is there any way to automaticaly sort documents in folders for different adresssants?
 I know its possible to automatically sort it into {created_year}/{correspondent}/{title} ... with a few other parameters.
 Background of this is, I want to sort in documents for my father and for me to seperate folder structures like {myself}/{created_year}/{correspondent}/{title} and {my_dad}/{created_year}/{correspondent}/{title}
 Any idea if this is possible? Weather automatically or manually?
 Important for me is, that it is really a folder structure, not only tagged.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, due to the power cost (our bill last month was over $1K USD), so I built a power efficient server to replace my proxmox server, my Nas and my firewall. 
 It’s running a i5-8600K, 32GB DDR4 ram, 1TB NVMe, and 2x14TB HDD’s.
 Thinking of taking some of the 1TB SSD’s from my old server and turning them into a cache drive on my new server but I’m not sure about that yet.
 Compared to my old proxmox server (which used around 2.5KWh daily), this server uses less than 1KWh daily, so I’m happy with the investment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm building a rack since I now work from home and this is needed. I need good bandwidth while not ruining myself and we all know this can go quite fast in networking and servers.
 On another sub a user told me that if I wanted to max out the SFP+ ports between my server and my computers I needed RDMA. I then found an RDMA daughter card for my r730xd server and Mellanox CX3 cards for my computers.
 I then asked myself, is my switch compliant with RDMA? Another user replied and said that a switch needs to be PFC (Priority Flow Control) so it can do RDMA. For my budget I'm currently looking at the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP which have 4x SFP+ ports and PoE and is L2+ which does everything I need. At least that's what I though before that unclear stuff about RDMA. I called TP-Link and they told me my question was too complicated and that someone would call me back tomorrow which they did. The man on the phone was really lost and couldn't answer my question and said I would receive an email. I never received an email and it's been dead silent since then.
 TLDR; Can someone tell me if the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP can do RDMA over 10GB/s between my server and my computers all on SFP+ ports?
 Sorry to ask for a noob question in this sub but I need help and really have to take a decision on the network daughter card before they ship my server.

 A. Get 3 wifi routers and set two of them up as access point nodes. 
 Or
 B. Go from modem to wifi router to managed switches in the rooms that currently have the satellites and replace the satellites with Poe access points.
 Or
 C. Someone who is way smarter than me will give me direction to a better solution.

 Am toying with nextcloud have just got setup on my unraid system. But wondering if there is a better tool out there?
 I want to deliver drone video footage to clients.
 I want actionable information about who downloaded data & when.
 I think inviting clients to create an account will be too much trouble.
 Is there a way I can send them a unique link and have them effectively sign for the files by inputing their names, email & phone number & clicking agree?
 Often clients may share the link with others and this is a way of safely sharing the files but also keeping some trail.
 Thanks

Set up a windows share of that drive on my network. That PC is plugged in to my comcast router. The Comcast WiFi sucks though so I have an ASUS mesh network plugged in to that for whole house devices. The windows PC also runs Plex so I can’t put it behind a double nat by plugging it into the ASUS. I’ve got a 5ghz backhaul between the mesh network nodes and my home computer hardwired to one of the mesh nodes.
 Here’s the trouble… copying files between them I get like 30mbps. Using windows copy or Teracopy, doesn’t matter. 
 Both computers Speedtest at 500mbps to the internet ( and between the computers using a program to test LAN speed at 600+mbps) so clearly the WiFi backhaul is plenty faster to my home pc. 
 Any settings tweaks to speed up windows copies? It feels like those copies aren’t multithreaded… is there a better copy program that will?

 I thought I was safe as all of my equipment is surge protected. Last night we had a very close lightning strike. 
 The surge travelled through the ground. Into an unplugged coax cable outside. Through that cable and into an AP inside. Through that AP and into my Cat5e cables. Through those cables and killed my 24 port managed switch. It may have also damaged the NIC on one of my servers.
 This is my current theory at least.
 It is also a good idea to backup your switch configs to a remote server. Configuring my new switch is going to be a pain.

 Sorry I’m asking too after some people already did, I’d like to get a personal recommendation please.
 I’m regular to turn on my PC sometime during the day, at night shutting it down, and in between it enters sleep mode after 15 minutes of no use.
 For the last days I’m having my new HDD connected for some hours a day. I understood that an HDD doesn’t like being plugged out and in, and until now I did that because I haven’t been using it frequently. But now that I am, what is it best to do?
 Should I leave it connected to PC and continue letting it go in a sleep mode and shut it down once a day? Or is sleep mode/shutdown not good for the HDD and I should eject and unplug it?
 And what would be the recommendation if I go back to use it not as much?
 Thanks in advance.

 Someone mentioned recently they always spent 15% of the available space for a par2 data parity file when backup up to CD-R. Clearly back in the day. That idea intrigued me.
 Then someone chimed in that they still do this to this day for backups! Is this prevalent and a thing you are doing?
 I for one do a SHA512 crc of all the files and back up using 3-2-1 where ZFS 128bit, is the cornerstone of my approach. 
 However I have not done any more steps to improve the likelihood of recovery success. Maybe this is it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been searching for almost a year for software to meet some of my needs and keep falling short. I have about 50 gb of images and 10 tb of video for a research project that I need to organize, categorize, and have easy access to. My basic needs are:
 - Ability to import metadata for each file (currently in .csv files)
 - Ability to sort quickly between a handful of categories (creating my own hot keys is fine) and add free form tags
 - I would love to use the same app for photos and videos, but I've been operating under the assumption I will not find an app that will do both. 
 - Able to access files on a server
 - Accessible by multiple users on both Mac and Windows. Bonus: some ability to work on iOS or Android. 
 I'm currently using Devonthink for just images, which works *fine* but is giving me problems importing video via AppleScript and doesn't have Windows options. Anyone have any suggestions of what other options there may be out there to try to handle this?

 I have an old Acer Aspire lying around which I turned into a Plex server. The OS is Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS. It doesn't have that much space, and I heard that you could use Tdarr to compress video files. Is there any way I can run it on my laptop? Most of what I saw online about Tdarr was using it on something like a NAS or Unraid PC using Docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently am using a Synology DS918+ purely for storage (3x 14TB WD HDDs). I have a mini ASRock PC with an i7-1100K with 2x 1TB NVME SSD's running Unraid for all of my dockers (plex) & VMs. I like Unraid for that.
 ​
 I purchased a 10gbe switch and am evaluating what to do with my setup to use at least 2.5gbe on my NAS and primary workstation.
 ​
  
Build a cheap AMD Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 ATX tower and put in my 14TB HDDs (3 are in my DS918+ and I have 2 extra) and 32GB of ECC RAM and run TrueNAS or Xpenology and setup shares. Keep using my little i7 unraid box for VMs & docker (plex). I'd do 3 or 4 HDDS to start in Z1. I can add another array in the future? I'm a TrueNAS noob.
 Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Unraid for everything. No ECC RAM though with the i7... Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. Only concern is will I have issues with bitrot on Unraid vs. ZFS or Synology SHR.
 Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Proxmox and setup TrueNAS as a VM and run my Win & Linux VMs to proxmox. Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. 
 Buy a 5-bay DS1522+ use 4x14TB HDDs, 1x14TB HDD as a hotswap. Add their overpriced 10gbe card. Keep using it as my file shares, use Hyperbackup to other offsite DS220 and cloud backup to GDrive. Keep my mini i7 Unraid box. Sell my DS918+ to recoup some of the expense of new one.
  
I do like how easy Synology makes things (love Hyperbackup). I use their quickconnect feature and OpenVPN to access it remotely. For accessing my Unraid remotely I use Tailscale. If I used TrueNAS, what do they offer for easy offsite backups and syncing to google drive?
 ​
 I have a short depth server rack so I can't use any full size servers. An ATX tower I would set on the floor. It's all in a 5x5 closet, no ventilation. So I do have to consider heat. Currently the Synology HDDs run 37-40C.
 ​
 Any feedback appreciated.

 Basically I needed to expose an home server and I was ready to do the usual dance of enabling port forward on the router, expose SSH server to public internet, maybe install wireguard...etc.
 I looked into this sub for inspirations and I found tailscale, and it blew my mind. All devices are connected just "like magic"....now I'm wondering "where is the bad news?" 
 I can imagine that someone doesn't like to use private service for network routing, but if that's the only problem, I can live with that :)

 I’m looking to back up the movies/TV in my plex server (~12 TB) on my DS 920+ to a cloud provider, since I have external hard drives as local backups. I’ve only had the NAS for a few months but want to make sure I don’t lose my data and adhere to the 3-2-1 rule.
 Synology C2 is an option that I’m considering primarily because it seems like it should integrate well with the NAS, and the cost seems slightly better than what I would have to pay for something like Backblaze (~$800 vs. ~$1000).

 Component Choice Comments/questions 
  
 Case RSV-L4500U 15 bays for 4U isn't much, but I'm hoping it will improve cooling (read: run quieter) 
  Motherboard Supermicro X11SCH-F  
  CPU Intel Xeon E-2288G  
  RAM 32GB ECC Is this compatible with both the CPU and mobo? 
  Boot drive 32GB SuperMicro SATADOM  
  HBA LSI 9211-8i (look on eBay)  
  Hard drives WD Red I plan to start with a single mirrored pair and add mirrored pairs as needed 
  Cooling Noctua case/cpu fans  
  PSU Corsair ATX 650W 80 plus gold  
 
 For software I plan to run zfs on TrueNAS CORE. I plan to add mirrored pair vdevs over time as needed.
 Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share what we've been working on at Grist. We've been experimenting with AI-generated Python formulas to help everyday spreadsheet users write formulas in spreadsheets. Why? Spreadsheets are the original low-code platform – sprinkle in a little bit of code and you get a big benefit. But that little bit of code can be daunting for some. What if AI could bridge the gap between what the user needs a formula to do, as expressed in plain English, and the correct formula?
 While AI spreadsheet formula writing is not new, Grist has two benefits:
  
Grist supports Python formulas in the spreadsheet. Current AI models are quite good at writing Python code, and getting better. As a bonus, by writing formulas in Python, this tool could help spreadsheet users learn Python, a more universal and capable language than traditional spreadsheet functions.
 A Grist document is a relational database with its schema neatly described in Python in Grist's "Code View," which is available to the bot, helping it make inferences.
  
We tested the experiment using formulas from our template gallery to approximate real use cases. The AI-generated formulas were correct 36 out of 48 times in the minimal experiment dataset. You can view the results of that test here: https://public.getgrist.com/n3jAtRYDSVWe/AI-Formula-dataset
 And a gif to show it in action! 
 https://i.redd.it/2tlx5xfl953a1.gif
 While this feature is not yet a part of Grist for the everyday spreadsheet user, we wanted to share the experiment's code with self-hosters who might want to play with it.

For the logistics software I am just looking for something that can help me track packages and add updates as well as probably the cost of items.

 I have tried Odoo and I only really like it for the their POS module and quotations module. Any and all suggestions are appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, So, I'm selfhosting AdGuardHome DNS on my VPS and using it as DoH I haven't exposed the port 53 to public in order to avoid spam and have only exposed the secure DNS ports as 853 Now, if I use DNS, then my ping timings are increasing to around 400 MS and whereas without the DNS they are only 8-10 MS. (I'm on Windows) Is it possible that Windows is first trying to resolve the DNS via plane IP address on port 53 before falling back to DoH? I feel this because Windows asks for the DNS IP as well as DoH URL.

 I believe it came with a MonoPrice order (with 1U keystone blank panel), and they're in bags of 24.
 The rectangular size is ALMOST exactly the dimensions of an ethernet plug (looking at an Ethernet plug from the "front", meaning the smallest dimension). But they don't seem meant for empty sockets as they just fall out..
 I normally label everything I keep precisely to avoid this problem, lol. TYVM.

 EDIT: Added 2nd image to show how it doesn't seem to relate to the 1U keystone plate. These little pieces are 1cm or 5/16 wide.

 I have a whole bunch of HDDs for different backups and every few months, connect them to this caddy and use a comparison tool to drag new / updated files across.
 It's more of a case that I don't continually backup and rarely need to access the backed up data, so electricity costs probably won't be worth keeping a NAS on all the time (although I could combine it with a HTPC, but even that we use less than once a week these days).
 So... people who backup, do you have backups attached through as NAS or what?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been shopping around for various Unified Device Management solutions that would allow the workers at my small company to sign in to their devices with SSO (OpenID Connect or SAML) or LDAP. Additionally, I would like to be able to manage the policies on these devices.
 Ideally, we'd like something self-hosted, but I have not found anything that comes even close to meeting these criteria.
 The closest options we've found:
 - Mesh Central - If we used this solution, then it seems like we'd only be able to use *remote* machines. Such as self-hosted remote workspaces. Not sure if it allows for policy management in addition to access management.
 - VMware Workspace One - Offers exactly what we need, including LDAP sync, but is not self-hosted and requires a 25-user or 25-device minimum, which is much more than we need at the moment.
 -PGina - It is free, open source, and self-hosted but not actively maintained and only offers Windows Authentication and no policy controls.
 We've also considered spinning up a Microsoft Active Directory instance, establishing a trust between it and our FreeIPA instance, and having Windows computers access it over VPN, but that only solves the problem for Windows computers.
 Are any of you familiar with any self-hosted applications which allow for Unified Device Management similar to what we are looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pointing a subdomain to DuckDNS which is pointing to my home server which is hosting my website on Nginx.
 The DNS is set up as follows:
 site.mydomain.com ---CNAME---> site.duckdns.org ---> Server Dynamic IP
 Port forwarding is set up on my router which routes 80 to 80, 443 to 443, and 2200 to 22 (Port 22 is used by my router itself) of the home server's internal IP.
 I have managed to get it working but the weird part is that this setup only works when I'm connecting from outside the network. When I'm in the network, everything (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) doesn't work at all. What could be possibly the issue here? Pinging from the terminal, however, seems to be working fine.
 I have also tried those 3 services using both the domain site.mydomain.com and site.duckdns.org but both aren't working. It however works if I'm using the Internal IP 192.168.0.XXX. Public IP doesn't work too unless I'm not connected to the same network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am new to NAS and all this stuff haha, so I could really use some tips and useful information in the proccess.
 ​
 Background information
 ​
 I have 3 main external hard drives:
 ​
 1. 14 TB for Movies 2. 14 TB for TV Shows 3. 2 TB for Family Photos, Backup of my smartphone photos and other important stuff 4. I will buy hard drives for each one of these external hard drives because I want to have everything with a backup. 
 ​
 Movies: 80% is 1080p, 20% is 2160p (90% of them x265)
 TV Shows: 90% is 1080p, 10% is 2160p (all of them x265)
 ​
 I download the media content through Arrs (Sonarr, Radarr and Bazarr) and play it through Plex in all my devices.
 ​
 I would like to have the 3 hard drives always running in the NAS and make the backups for them 4 times a year (with external HDD and keep them in a different location for robberies or fires).
 ​
 Any useful information about the way I would like to manage my NAS and data would be nice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I'm looking into options to take a group of roughly 40 people off Facebook. Right now we use a mixture of FB groups and email to communicate, and multiple Google calendars to organise us. Cost is pretty crucial, as in I don't really have money to spend. I can spare up to $15 on a VPS or root server but that's about it. I'm an absolute novice when it comes to self hosting but I can find my way around a console if there's a good tutorial. 
 So far I had rocket.chat running in a VM and I like a lot. It does everything I want more or less out of the box. The thing I'm worried about is the notification limit on the free tier, 10 000 notifications / user / month comes down to 8.33 / user / day with a group of 40. Not a lot. Then again I'm unsure how much the DM function will be used so maybe it's fine? Compiling and distributing my own mobile apps is a bit much. Or is it? 
 I've seen matrix with element recommended a lot but I don't quite get what the difference between the free and commercial element tiers are? Should I host my own element instance? What about mobile apps if I self host?
 Bonus question, jitsi looks great and is easy to integrate. Do I need to host my own server? I can't quite figure out what the limitations of meet.jit.si are?
 Apologies for the wall of text. This is all new to me and I'm quite surprised and exciting by the options out there!

 Finally people on the call are just like,… “did your power go out like 3 times? And how are you still… why didn’t you… what the?”
 Of course all my APs are PoE back to the Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE in the basement, and everything including the Fios ONT is battery backed up by UPS.
 This was the first live test but it worked flawlessly 😎
 Anyone else have success stories that made you pat yourself on the back and think “man I’m glad I did this right.”?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A while ago I made a huge mistake and I lost all my data on my exteenal hard drive, over 2TB of stuff just gone. The expert I talked to said that there was no chances of recovery. However during my Chrisrmas cleaning I found a backup of an older hard-drive that I completely forgot about and I managed to recover 80% of my data. Through my Oblivion and Sims mods are gone as they were only on the destroyed drive, I got most of my audiobooks, ebooks and comics back, as well as personal pictures and data. I feel so relieved. I was fully prepared to have to start from 0 and was grieving my loss and then this. I could dance. From now on I will make regular backups and not put all my eggs in one basket.
 Edit: Story for any mistakes english is not my first language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a doctoral student, and while I've been storing copies of my research files (camera trap photos, R code files, some GIS files, etc) on an external drive, I've been thinking about adding a cloud storage service for redundancy. My research files at the moment total just under 100 GB (my system in total takes up under 350 GB, in case a full system backup is what is recommended). I don't expect to access these files often (ideally never) but in case something happens on my machine, or I just do something stupid and delete a file/folder I need, I want to be able to quickly access/retrieve the needed files/folders (so not necessarily retrieving the whole system). It would be nice to encrypt my research files, but I'm not working on anything where I am unduly worried about data theft in any case. I'd say my priorities are: 
  
Reliability 
 Cost (of storage primarily, then upload/download)
 Download Speed/accessibility 
 Security/Privacy 
 Upload speed
  
I use a Windows machine from Lenovo if that makes any difference, but could conceivably move to a Macbook down the line. I use File History with my external backup drive.
 I'm posting cus I see so many different recommendations from iDrive to Backblaze to IceDrive to Mega, etc, including in this subreddit, and I figure at this point I'm overthinking it and should seek recs for my specific use case scenario (or maybe for what I want, it doesn't really matter all that much what I choose)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having an issue getting pleroma to work properly. I've been trying to host a pleroma instance on debian 11 bullsyeye. Installed pleroma and nginx using this guide: https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/debian_based_en/. When I access pleroma using localhost:4000, I can see my instance, but it is not connected to the outside world (The search bar doesn't return anything). In the pleroma server terminal I get this warning: 
 [warn] Rate limiter disabled due to forwarded IP not being found. Please ensure your reverse proxy is providing the X-Fowarded-For header or disable the remote IP plug/rate limiter.
 When I try and access pleroma using my domain, I just get infinate loading. Meanwhile the pleroma server shows GET requests. Almost like pleroma is receiving the requests but the information is not getting out to the user. 
 My Pleroma.nginx config is enterly stock apart from changing the server name and certificate locations.
 I have portfowarding configered on my router, and when I access my domain name without pleroma running, I get a defult Nginx is working, but you need to configure it. Which implies my domain name does point towards my debain machine. So im completely stuck. Installed and reinstalled pleroma and nginx and even the OS a few times. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated, I am new to linux and networking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear reddit,
 My name is Rodolfo Berrios and I'm an indie developer from Chile.
 I created an image sharing software called Chevereto (username checks out) which I introduced in 2007. Chevereto enables to create your own image sharing website. Pretty much like your own Imgur/Flickr/etc. It is made to replace the need for these services and cheaply run it on your servers. The idea came when ImageShack removed pictures that I was hot-linking at online forums and here we are after all these years.
 Chevereto is a family company, I'm in charge of the software and my wife does marketing. We are a small team and we love what we do.
 I'm posting here to introduce our new free edition, AGPLv3 licensed, now available at chevereto/chevereto. This edition is focused in personal usage and it is on pair with our paid releases.
 Hope you can give it a try and thanks for reading!
 P.S. You can learn more about this new Chevereto free edition in a post I wrote at my blog.

 On some sites like Mubi, there are very interesting films which can be hard to come across in other places. I have discovered many rare films this way and when they remove them from the catalog they are very hard to find. I work in film stuff and would love to be able to revisit many of these later on.
 Can anyone point me to how I could do this? Any sites, videos, posts, etc, which explain this would be greatly appreciated.

 I'm not exactly a major datahoarder but I'm definitely a sentimentalist. Recently thanks to some dumb decisions on my part and not paying attention while working on hard drives, and some circumstances that led to me losing my backups, I lost 2TB of super important sentimental data spanning 18 years almost. I feel like an idiot for screwing this up so badly. It's been three weeks and I'm horribly depressed to say the least. I feel like I lost a loved one.
 Those who can share experiences and give advice, please do, I want to stop feeling so much intense grief. Or at least reduce it.
 (Before anyone brings it up, no, data recovery is impossible)

I want to get 5 100GB Blu-Ray M-Disks for a long-term cold storage, but I've heard in passing that DVD's are more reliable, but they hold a lot less. Is the difference negligible or for long-term storage is one better than the other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well it finally happened to me, one of my 14TB's in my Synology failed. It's one of 2 14TB's that I shucked and I kept everything (box, plastic shells, cables, etc) and opened it without breaking any clips; HOWEVER it doesn't look like I marked which internal drive came from which enclosure.
 I read through some threads here and it seems very hit or miss either way (sending bare shucked drive or reassembling). I'm guessing there's no way for us to tell which internal drive belongs in which shell?

 I want a storage solution for family photos and videos kept on over 20 separate CDs and 2-3 USB drives.
 I found this HDD in a local store and was wondering whether it could be used for storage (connected to a docking station) from time to time.
 I read that this is a surveillance HDD that can be used 24/7, so my question is if it can be used occasionally, say once every two months, and then stored somewhere else without power?

 However, there's a small discrepancy in the total files/file sizes.
 Is there a tool to analyze both drives and show me which files it finds that differ between the two?
 Everything seems to be (mostly) in order, but there's a 6GB difference in used space on the two drives.
 (Also worth noting that my taskbar flashes for a few seconds while the desktop loads on the cloned drive, which doesn't happen if I boot from the old drive. I am using an app called TaskbarX, but it isn't working properly since cloning and I don't think that's the issue as the flashing was happening prior to re-configuring that program. In any case, this isn't the proper subreddit for that particular issue)

 Anyone know a doorbell camera that can send notifications to my phone with video but not use the cloud? I'd prefer it if I could keep the data local, preferably on my home server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize this questions gets thrown around a lot, but here I am asking again as I wasn't happy with the specifics per the other posts I came across. Perhaps a sticky/reference list of all the more common SFP+ modules, their release date, compatability with things like ESXi, general performance expecations, costs, ect.
 In my particular case, I've got a new R450 that I'll be using with Hyper-V on a slightly older T440 Hyper-V host. I'd like to setup replication between them and the backups we are creating could also use some wider bandwidth than 1gb NICs (no LAG, avoiding it). The new R450 came with a Broadcom dual SFP+. I'd be using 1 SFP+ via a DAC back to our UniFi Pro switch and I was thinking of creating a direct connection between the two hosts with SFP+ and a DAC cable. Making this purely for replication of our multiple VMs and virtual workstations, preventing this traffic from even having to touch our switches.
 The Intel x520-DA2 all seem long in the tooth and picky about modules, and the newer x710 even more so. Is there another solid option for dual SFP+ modules that play nice with Dell Servers (T440)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I recently picked up a Dell R720 on trademe (New Zealand website). It's got:
 2x E5-2630v2, 128GB DDR3, 8x 3.5", Perc H310 Mini, and an idrac express.
 So, overkill for home use, but hey, why not right!?
 ​
 So first I'm going ot make sure I'm all up do date with the firmware and things. Anything else I should do before getting started (like upgrading to a certain level of firmware and not all the way?)
 ​
 After that is done, on to installing more hardware. So far I've got 2x 8TB Ironwolfs and 6x 2TB Dell Enterprise drives to go in the front. Was thinking I'd make one raidz2 of the 6x 2TB drives for the data storage and home backups (and use something like backblaze or google archive for offsite backup of this) and then for the two 8TB, just leave as two disks for media use for plex (don't mind if i lose media, can always redownload (1GB connection FTW!)).
 ​
 As for the OS and LXCs and VMs, since all the front bay drives will be full, I'm thinking I'll order in 2x Samsung 980 250GB and 2x PCIe nvme adapter cards. Hopefully I can use the clover bootloader method to boot off of a internal USB stick that points to the mirrored nvme cards(?)
 ​
 From there I'm thinking I'll use proxmox as my base OS and have a bunch of LXC and VMs. Currently looking to hadware pass the drives to TrueNAS and have that be the main arbiter of disk space. Any ideas if this is a good way to go? 
 ​
 I'll also be installing your usual home media things: Plex, Sonarr, Jackett, Deluge, etc.
 ​
 Along with some things like pihole, are there any other great bits of kit I should be looking at installing? Will look at getting a server nVidia GFX card for transcoding/mining/stable diffusion etc. Any ones I should look for/stay away from?

I realized after the Hi Fiber (which works from Server to switch on a 15ft run) that I needed an 80m transceiver. Fiber Mall and Ipolex did not work at all, it didn't even light up the in the spf+ port when I connected my cable from my patch panel to the RJ45 transceiver. The Hi Fiber did light up but it was stuck at 1Gb, not 10Gb. For NICs in my gaming rig I have a TP Link TX401 and I tried the X520-T2 both resulted in just 1Gb.

 I have a small plex media server I use for porn primarily and movies secondary. I really like the idea of being self-hosted and I like the experience of having reliable access to my media on my terms. I'm thinking of moving over all my stuff to a Jellyfin server (including music and personal photos) once I can get that working. I like how Jellyfin is open source because it makes me feel as though I can use it indefinitely as long as I have access to the source code, and I can configure it as I please.
 The only media application I don't think I can fully replace is Spotify/Apple Music soley because I like being recommended new music. Is there a way to bypass having to manually download music so that I can get new music recommendations that just magically appear on my media server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I've been hosting a few http services both in my Pi at home, and in a public cloud and I don't like the VPN way of accessing my services. Sometimes I need to browse my server in a friends computer or phone, and it gets messy or impractical, so I end up exposing the services to the public web sometimes. I worry quite a bit about forgetting to update my software and finding my server being used to host sketchy bank scams.
 What I have been thinking of doing is blacklisting every IP in my nginx reverse proxy, but allowing a single HTTP endpoint to be accessed, like "allow.domain.com", where after receiving any http request, it would add the origin IP into the whitelist for a set amount of time (a few hours). I would also setup geoblock to only allow the endpoint to be accessed from my country.
 The point is that I don't need a super locked-down set up, I just want the peace of mind that my server is not just visible to anyone. If I am at work I can authorize my ip for a few hours just by accessing a simple endpoint, if I want to share a file with a friend I can forward them a link without having to worry about setting up a VPN connection for them, just letting them know they first have to go to allow.domain.com before trying to open my link every few hours or days. 
 Is that ok? I searched a bit to see if there's something like this prod. ready but I couldn't find. I know it's still the single point of failure of the http service being open to the web, and the fact that it's a bit "security through obscurity", but I just need something to give a little reassurance and more security than just being blindly open to the world. I am not hosting copyrighted media, or anything illegal, just a few status servers, change detection, python-notebook, a few api's I made for my work, non-private files, etc.

 I have a PowerEdge M630 that I'm trying to install and boot XCP-NG from iSCSI on. It looks like XCP-NG doesn't support software iSCSI boot, and I have to use an iSCSI HBA. My M630 has a QLogic converged NIC with BCM57810 which according to this document has "Offloaded full HBA functionality iSCSI initiator". To me that means I should be able to mount a target and have it visible to the OS for install. (Maybe I'm wrong here?) I have configured the card in BIOS, and sometimes I can see the card connect to the target, sometimes it doesn't. Anytime it tries it says the connection succeeded though. Does this chipset need drivers installed for it to be visible to XCP-NG? Or should it just work? Furthermore, am I misunderstanding something / going about this incorrectly?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies in advance if I missed a section in the hardware FAQs -
 I am designing a small home lab on a rack-mount server that supports 10-20 VM workloads (TrueNAS, pfSense, Plex, handful of others, plus some headroom to mess around). I need minimum 8 3.5" HDD bays for my NAS, though 12 would be ideal. As for the other equipment, I plan to use an unmanaged network switch and a UPS with a maximum depth of about 16 inches.
 When I look around for rack-mount PC cases or chassis, most of them are at least 27 inches deep, which would extend the overall footprint of the rack by quite a bit. I am aiming for low power consumption and don't need a ton of VMs, so I am considering a microATX motherboard or similar small footprint. I see a handful of shallow-depth chassis or cases out there but none of them seem have enough HDD bays.
 My question is: Are there any shallow depth rack cases/chassis out there with at least 8 HDD bays? I don't mind going with a 4U or even taller system if it allows me to arrange the drives vertically above the mobo. My main goal is to reduce the floor footprint. Thanks!

 I understand that if a drive fails you can just swap it out and the NAS will repair/repopulate data from the other drive, but I don't know what would happen if the NAS itself failed? Do you just connect the drives to PC and copy/paste the files inside, or do you have to get another NAS of the same brand and hook the drives up to the new NAS to access those files?
 I'm planning on getting a 2 bay Synology and set up RAID 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I'm having a hard time finding a quality 6+ port USB hub to hook temporarily (4-5 months) six MyBooks (all 14TB) to a mini-PC on a Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 port. Typical usage would be copy/move stuff between the internal SSD drive to any one of the six MyBooks (one operation at a time). The important thing is the presence of individual on/off switches, so the drives would only run on demand (I need each one only 2-3 times a week and don't want them spinning up randomly or at boot/shutdown).
 The only semi-legit device I can find is this hub by StarTech, however, most people in the sub have a pretty bad opinion about that brand and the price seems a bit steep, to be honest. That being said, the last thing I want is for my data to become corrupted because of some alphabet soup brand's bad hardware... (speaking of which, any recommendations for a solid USB-B to Type-C data cable are much appreciated!)
 What I like about StarTech's device is the use of actual switches, and not buttons, which usually don't remember the last state after power-cycling...
 Thanks for reading and have a good one!

 My guess would be using old laptops? Most of the use would be for TV shows and music for most people, but I also run a business that requires streaming video meetings. I suppose a Starlink would be required, and as it is finally covering most of Australia it has to be an option, esp as 5G is nowhere near ready for proper use yet.
 Any other suggestions or directions towards websites where someone has already tried this?
 Thanks.

 I just received 4 ironwolf 4TB drives (ST4000VN006) and started checking them for potential damage from shipping.So i did a smart check on all of them (https://file.io/0e2x4hA6sV8m)
 smartctl /dev/sdX -x 
 and discovered that one of them (Disk 2) is having "Pending Defects log (GP Log 0x0c)" unlike the 3 others.
 Is that something i should be worried about ? Should i send it back for replacement ?I can't seem to find what those infos means.
 I also started a badblocks and a long smart test on all 4 drives, but it's gonna take time.
 badblocks -v /dev/sdX smartctl /dev/sdX -t long 
 Thank you in advance.

 I've finished ripping the Blu-Rays for Avatar: The Last Airbender. And while I'm very happy with the result, each episode clocks in at around 5.5GB which isn't exactly ideal for streaming.
 I will of course be keeping these original files, but I've recently built a new PC with a 5700x and a 6700xt so I can once again re-encode things (hooray).
 The BD of ATLA is an upscaled version of the original 480p broadcasts (might've been 480i, unsure). I'm looking for "visually lossless", which should be easy as many scenes already look not the best. I'd have to apply lots sharpening filters and such to get a better look, something which I don't have experience with.
 Anyhow, using ffmpeg, how do you guys usually re-encode media for smaller sizes? Doom9 mentions a few x265 options specifically, but ofc many clients don't support direct h265 streams.
 Bonus question: blu ray subs are not fun, what's the best way to turn them into actual subtitles?

Is it possible to burn a few gigs to an M-disk, and then come back later, do a file compare and add more files to the same disk? Keeping everything that's already on the disk just adding more data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a solution for cloning images of my drives that works for Linux systems and supports incremental backups. My current solution is Clonezilla. Works really well but requires me to clone the entire drive every time.
 I've combed through the community posts. Many seem to recommend Macrium Reflect. The posts are a bit on the older side, though. Is Macrium still a good option? 
 Also, not strictly necessary; but is there an option that allows me to keep using my system as it does the backup? I don't think even Macrium allows that on Linux systems.
 I'd really appreciate any guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the media I host, it seems like RPG Rulebooks are the odd one out in that nothing works great for them. Big PDF files that need to be organized by Game, and subfolders for different resources per game (Maps, Adventures, Rule Books, Player Guides, etc).
 This 'hierarchical' structure becomes a real issue when trying to use any current solution out there for PDFs, because they really need to be grouped together, but nothing provides a folder level grouping. 
  
Paperless - No folder grouping at all. No way to subdivide rpgs into various groups without a ton of manual tagging, which should just be read at the folder level
 
Komga - Doesn't read folder hierarchy. It reads the individual folders, but it doesn't nest folders in the UI
 
Kavita - Doesn't display folder based hierarchy, and instead shows each individual PDF
 
 Are there any good PDF organization tools that can use nested folders and possibly even tags properly to organize RPG Rulebooks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been on the hunt for a good self hosted “notes” app for a while now, but apparently that’s not the right word to use for what I’m looking for. 
 Apps like MilaNote is more what I’m looking for. I’m currently using Notability, but don’t like being tied to iCloud.
 I am still currently playing around with Etherpad, but it doesn’t allow embedding PDFs, and lacks any serious way to organize different pads. Plus I can’t find much of a community. 
 AppFlowy looks promising but is lacking most of what I currently need. 
 Affine has started over so it currently lacks everything I need, but I’m keeping an eye on it. 
 I have found a few projects that run in browser, but most don’t allow importing PDFs which is big for me. And none seem to have any “in app” organization.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this moment I have a high available k3s cluster running on proxmox containing ZFS storage with several applications like Authentik, jellyfin, firefly, sonarr, radarr, nextcloud, and much more. I have some applications running on a docker host as well. Every application that doesn't use sqlite has it's own database statefullset with a PVC using longhorn or NFS. The docker apps have a docker container with docker volume. Since I now have different approaches, I would like to migrate this so all applications use 1 external high-available database.
 I don't have much experience with HA databases, so I can't really decide which way I should go. I found a postgres-operator to be run on a kubernetes cluster: https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator. And a guide to setup postgres HA with patroni: https://arctype.com/blog/postgres-patroni/
 Which approach do you use at home? Any other recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am managing my self-hosted applications via Docker Compose. As the number of applications is growing, I am thinking about a backup strategy for my data stored in the Docker volumes.
 I still haven't decided whether it is better to use named Docker volumes, or just simple local volume mounts. For local volume mounts, backup would be fairly easy to do (just tar everything a move to a backup storage). For named Docker volumes, it seems like the process is a bit more complicated, since Docker doesn't seem to provide any built-in commands for backup and restore.
 How do you backup your Docker stuff? Does anyone know of applications making those things a bit easier?

It seems that hard drives of that size and at capacities over 1tb are a rarity/mostly exist as external hard drives. I'd ideally like a warranty on the drives as well as opposed to shucking the drives. So far I've just been able to find a Toshiba 4tb drive for 84 dollars. However I have my doubts about it's reliability. I was hoping and wondering if someone would know of a better option than what I've found.. thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, I have what I think is a proprietary connector, but I'd like to make sure before I shell out the big bucks on something that is commonly sold under a name I don't know.
 My company just acquired a bunch of busses, all of which included 24/7 Security's "Zeus" DVR, the problem is none of them had hard drives in them, go figure. 24/7 sells their hard drives for a cool $400 per, and I'm about to need probably 30+, that's a ton of money for hard drives. 
 Here's the info I have:
  
They're a single connector which is 20 pins.
 They are a hybrid style drive with an SSD and HDD inside- the SSD records while the bus is in motion and then transfers it to the HDD once the bus has stopped.
 There's multiple other SD card slots and the like as seen here.
  
Is there any sort of alternative to their "infinity drive" or am I stuck buying those and-or replacing the whole system? Any and all help is much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I have had 2 different lab setups I did in the past at home. However I have never really done anything involving switches... it was always tinkering with and connecting up DD-WRT flashed routers and really old computers I had acquired when I was doing computer repair. We have an issue at the small office of 7 employees that I was hoping I could receive some help on. This may not be appropriate to ask here, but /r/networking seemed like it was more of a place for enterprise level stuff, and this subreddit seems to be a place for home networking. My problem falls kinda in between. 
 At my new job we have a bit of a mess in terms of a "network"... Lots of ethernet cables ran all over the building to offices that aren't used anymore. We have 2 people using USB Wifi Dongles to connect wireless to the router and the rest of the computers are hardwired between two switches. We also have an old server that is not being utilized. Folks that are hardwired to the switches can't Samba share to anyone not hooked up to the same switch. 
 I have a network cable tester and tracer coming in the mail Thursday. I figure that is probably step 1 in trying to find out what is going on since nothing is labeled anywhere. What I'm hoping to achieve is to do minimal wire runs and configuration to allow for all of us in the office to be able to communicate via Samba and set up a way for automatic backups to be done on the old server that is not in use.
 It seems to me that connecting the switches together through a simple configuration might would solve these problems. A very basic overview of networking basics seems like where I need to start. I'm hoping to not have to dive too deep and eat up too much time. If anyone has a good link or resource for me, it would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've had a home server up and running for a few months, at first it was just local with only plex exposed. Now I am going to visit family in December and I want to access my media server while I'm away, and I've got that working. I've done the following for my server and i want to know if I need to do anything else, security-wise.
 - I have NOT exposed the unRAID web UI to the internet.
 - All exposed containers are running on a customer bridge network.
 - Nginx reverse Proxy manager manages which ports are exposed to subdomains.
 - Nginx has an SSL certificate and all containers are forced to use HTTPS.
 - In Cloudflare, I've set the domain to full SSL/TLS encryption.
 - All containers have different passwords to access.
 The only thing I can think of doing next is adding a VPN, but I'd like to know from you guys how important you think it is to implement.

The one thing that is a bit challenging is that if I resolve some of the duplicates without all of them. It "concludes" my session and requires me to essentially start over. I was wondering if theres a similar program that allows you to "recheck found duplicates" or "update" without starting over... Thanks

 I'm building a website for a political party and we need something similar to Google Forms but with the ability to ask the user to confirm his entry by clicking a link sent in his emails. Compatibility with Zapier is a really nice bonus, but at least ease of integration for third party APIs or webhooks is required (we'll need it to link the forms to compagnies' API in order to send mail IRL when an entry is confirmed, and we're also working with Ghost's member panel).
 I spoted Budibase, which looks quite cool and way simpler / cheaper than Backendless for what we'll do with it. (two or three forms) But I can't find any documentation mentionning the ability to require the user to click on a confirmation link. Is it doable ?

 YMMV. This is definitely a hacky solution.

 First I added the card to the VM following the instructions at https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Pci_passthrough
  
Enable IOMMU

 Find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add amd_iommu=on or intel_iommu=on for AMD or Intel CPUs respectively

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear all that read this,
 I’m new in this self-hosting game, I’ve been watching this sub and looking into self hosting myself for quite some time but haven’t been able to for money reasons.
 I want to self host for multiple reasons. First reason, chalenge, i don’t have much infra/system/server/network experience, i have a beginning diploma but I don’t have the school smarts to continue. Second reason, fun, I like tech, always have and I love having these kind of projects. Third, privacy, in my tech journey I’ve discovered how messed up compagnies handle your data and i don’t like it. Fourth and important one for this post, I kind of want to put this in my resume somehow, might even be a part of my resume, or even could be the full resume if I can somehow.
 So, my actual question is : since i want my self hosting on my resume, and i know that in entreprise level hosting, they mostly use Kubernetes and not docker (wich i am currently using but can change that, I’m not toi far yet) should I and can I use Kubernetes on my main and only server as a server with no Kubernetes clients attached to it, I might and probably will attach more servers to it in the future but for now is it actually doable and is it worth it ? I could also make multiple VMs in my main server and cluster those together but i know that doesn’t go too well with the Kubernetes philosophy so not too sure what to think about that. Anyway, I’m waiting on all of your opinions to see what i can/should do, thanks !

 After research and many calls with my lovely German wife (who helped translate) we were able to get the Sh$$ box into bridge mode.
 I Currently am running OPNsense on a Fujitsu thin client and love the functionality and security it provides for my homelab.
 My problem is that the internet just sh$$s the bed sometimes, and I'm uncertain whether it's me or Vodafone. Sometime ill have a stable version I get working and then all of a sudden, internet just stops working or drops out.
 We called them, and they says there is nothing they can do and intend to improve my network where I am, but give no time frame. I also get no help configuring some setting that I need from the ISP for my OPNsense and need to find German forums of people who have figured out what setting work for them.
 Now, as tech-savvy as I am, I'm also learning with the whole dualstack configuration. Should I just give up and get this Fritzbox? Will this solve my issues, or is this just a German infrastructure thing that won't fix itself?
 I'm just searching for some advice from people who run home labs and such in Germany, specifically ex unity media customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Which one would be more desirable? Is there any advantages of one vs the other in terms of price, modularity? I currently only have a 2.5Gbps network card in my server, and I have an unused SFP+ port in my router, so as I see it I have two options:
 Buy an SFP+ PCIe card to go in my server, and connect via DAC cable to the router
 or
 Buy an SFP+ RJ45 1/2.5/5/10 Gbps module, plug it to my server via a regular properly rated ethernet cable. I wouldn't upgrade to a 10 gig nic in this case (not immediately).
 On one side I like the idea of having the DAC connection but have no idea if I actually currently need the bandwidth between the server and my proxmox cluster (4 machines). On the other hand I like the fact that, if I want, I can plug the RJ45 cable to any client that doesn't have the SFP+ module as well.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've been running old HDDs for a while now on a Chembro chassis (SAS2-compatible) that can take 24x regular 3.5" disks. Since it came later, I never bothered with moving my system onto the Chembro, so the chassis is only being used for disks, and a different chassis hosts the system, which is connected to the disks via an external SAS cable. 
 Things have been working alright, but now I want to expand. I've been eying a Supermicro SC847 chassis with capacity for 36 disks. I'll likely replace the 24-disk chassis with this one. I could also look into moving the system onto this same chassis, but I'm concerned about heat. If I were to keep the disks separate, is a chassis like the 847 the best solution? Are there any "disk only" chassis out there that would allow me to connect my system to this array? What are people using these days?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m working on building my unraid NAS using a few recycled parts from previous builds. I was getting things ready when I noticed several bent pins in the old mobo I had slated for the build. I have a 10700k and an 11600k for the cause. I know neither is ideal in terms of power draw/heat, but I’d prefer not to sell and replace. With all that in mind, are there any ATX boards with 2.5g LAN that make more sense than others in terms of features and price? Currently, I only need 6 sata ports and a single m.2 gen 3. Any guidance is appreciated! Thanks!
 Edit: based on my own research it looks like the Gigabyte B560 Aorus Pro AX board might do the trick. Eager for your input though!

 On my homeserver i'm running an Ubuntu 18.04 VM on which i'm running a slightly old C# console application that i wrote myself. It is made in .NET Framework 4.7.2 so it needs an application called Mono to run. In case anyone doesn't know, Mono is a conversion layer to run .NET Framework applications on Linux.
 Now on the same VM i'm trying to run another console application i wrote, but this one is written in .NET 6. This version of .NET does not need mono anymore, so my exe should be able to run natively (as long as i have the .NET 6 packages installed which i do). However Mono has hijacked my './' command so now when i try to run the .NET 6 exe i get a mono error.
 What i want to achieve is to be able to run the .NET 6 normally, and explicitly use the 'mono' command when i want to run older .NET framework exe's. I don't want it to run mono when i use the './' command. How can i achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I updated my computer to Fedora 37 and installed FreeFileSync v11.28 from FlatHub. 
 I've been using FFS for many years for backing up my files to a NAS Share.
 I do not keep the share permanently mounted in Fedora, I only mount it when I want to do a backup. I'd like to keep this practice. 
 In the past, I would first mount the share in Nautilus file manager, then open FFS and it would appear as a destination. Now, even if I have mounted the share in Nautilus, the share does not appear in FFS at all. 
 The NAS has the IP address 10.10.10.6 and the share is called "backup", so I assume I could enter any of the following and one would work: 
 /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=10.10.10.6,share=backup 
 or 
 //10.10.10.6/backup 
 or 
 smb://10.10.10.6/backup 
 but none of these works. 
 Has something changed?
 Is there a way to manually add the share's full path to FFS?

 Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases/tag/v4.0.0
 The new server version is a major update with the support for basic client authentication - previously all servers were public, now you can deploy your private servers (or change the configuration of the ones that are already deployed), so that only you and your friends can use them to receive the messages, and any other contacts will only be able to send the messages, as the invitation links you share with them in SimpleX Chat do not include server password.
 The latest version v4.3-beta of SimpleX Chat apps also includes server testing and sharing/adding servers via QR code, but the server authentication.
 We have also prepared a detailed guide about self-hosting the SimpleX messaging servers.
 SimpleX Platform
 SimpleX is the first and afaik the only communication platform that has no user profile identifiers of any kind - not even random numbers, unlike Signal, Matrix, Session, Briar, Jami, Cwtch, etc.
 Instead of user identifiers it uses temporary pairwise connection identifiers and anonymous credentials, allowing the servers to asynchronously deliver messages without having knowledge about how many users are there and how they are connected on the protocol level (some transport-level and timing correlation is possible, of course, and there will be further improvements to mitigate it).
 The security of SimpleX platform was recently assessed by Trail of Bits - see the announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been backing up my PC games from places like Steam, GOG, etc. on 100 GB Blu-ray discs. However, I have a lot of games to back up, and modern games can very easily go over 100 GB per game. I've been throwing around the idea of giving up optical media for my backups, and going with something like a 4TB SSD, especially today on Cyber Monday; putting games onto an SSD would be a lot faster than burning them to a Blu-ray disc, and obviously any SSD that I choose is going to hold more than a single Blu-ray disc, even a triple-layer one. If all I'm using the SSD for is long-term storage, can I expect reliability? I don't even plan on putting it into my PC, I would only plug it in externally whenever I want to add something to it for safekeeping, or if I want to restore/recover something later.
 Or, if I'm looking to save some money, how are mechanical HDDs for the long-term? I assume they're not as good as something with no moving parts.
 Thanks in advance for any insight, I really love the idea of long-term archiving, but I admit that I'm pretty new at this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A computer geek since birth, a dream since childhood has been to own a CRAY SUPERCOMPUTER!(dramatic keyboard strike) While kinda fudging the definition, it is Cray branded equipment. The picture is old, but this post is motivation for me to get the setup photoshoot ready.
 The stack consists of:
 Cray Green blade SR5110 5U blade enclosure with 10 GB512x blades. Each blade has: Motherboard: Intel S2600JF CPU: dual E5-2630L V2 OS: last running oVirt, considering OpenStack next PSU: 2xAC 2x48vdc
 Chassis: SuperMicro SC826E16 2u with 12lff bays + 2sff rear bays Motherboard: X9SRH-7F CPU: Xeon E5-1650 v2 cpu PSU: 1xAC 1x48vdc OS: TrueNAS Scale Storage: 2x1TB sff mirror boot 2x3TB lff mirror 10x5TB lff Raid Z1 40TB useable 58TB raw
 Chassis: SuperMicro CSE-847 4u 36 lff bay Motherboard: Tyan S5512 pulled from a HYVE-CYGNUS-J CPU: Xeon E3-1230 V2 PSU: 1xAC 1x48vdc OS: TrueNAS Scale Storage: whole mess of sata and sas drives
 Mellanox SX6036 36 port infiniband switch in Ethernet mode PSU: 2xAC 
 Brocade ICX7250-48 with the PSU chopped out so it runs off 12vdc directly
 8 Odroid HC2 arm sbc sata drive sleds Running Ubuntu 20.04 as gluster bricks 3x14TB 2x12TB 3x8TB For 90TB total Which all run off 12vdc
 All 12 vdc is fed from an AC power supply and a 48 to 12 vdc converter.
 So why all the DC? I also have a diy solar array and self built 48VDC lithium ion battery packs that directly feed this equipment, no need for an inverter.
 Glad to answer any questions. This post is to motivate me towards cleaning up and better documentation habits.

 Is anyone aware of an e-ink-based system (similar to rasbperry pi) that I might be able to hack together to always show the guest wifi code? I'd like to randomize it and change it often, but that's difficult in practice without being able to display it readily.
 My initial thought was to try to figure out something with the e-ink price tags at best buy, but they're designed to update by NFC, so I'd need to tap the device to my phone which defeats the purpose.
 Anyway, interested in thoughts...

We've used Kuma in the past, but it's unable to handle more than 300 urls. We're currently using our self made tool, which checks realtime http status and SSL validity (and a few client specific monitoring). 
 What we'd like to have:
 - Capacity voor atleast around 1000 urls
 - Uptime monitoring (history isn't needed, as long as we know a recent (5~10 minute difference, uptime status)
 - Current status page (sites that are down have to be visible in one view)
 - SSL expiry check (list those who will expire within the next 21 days)
 - optional: Notifications in teams (this is something we currently don't have but would really like)
 - optional: Notifications via mail
 We've tried zabbix, kuma, upptime and one self developed sollution, but none seem to fully qualify. I've been scrolling github for about an hour, and figured it might be time to ask for some help, so here I am.. 
 I would love to hear some of your suggestions!

After a lot of research and trial/error I’ve finally got the LDAP Outpost up and running and responding the ldapsearch queries from the terminal. I’m stuck now trying to figure out if there’s a way to configure the LDAP outpost to respond to anonymous queries, for example Mealie doesn’t have configuration options for a bind user.
 As far as I understand in a general LDAP implementation this shouldn’t be a problem as LDAP queries can either be submitted anonymously or as an unauthenticated user. What I can’t figure out is whether or not Authentik supports this and if it does how it should be configured in the outpost. I’ve been through all the Authentik documentation and every community guide I could find for integrating with other services that use LDAP but I’ve had no luck so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two routers; my ISP provided router, which handles my IoT and families devices on subnet 192.168.0.0, and my OPNSense router sitting behind my IPS router, which handles my server and personal devices on subnet 192.168.1.0.
 When my laptop is connected to the internet, it connects to my home server something like this:Laptop => https://nextcloud.foo.bar (123.45.67.89) => ISP router => OPNSense router => home server
 This configuration does not work when I am connected to my OPNSense router because my ISP router believes the connection is a loopback (Or at least, that's what I can infer). For this reason I am not able to connect to my home server without adding a line to my host file for every subdomain on my home server, which is a pain.
 TL;DR I would like to configure OPNSense to forward all connections which are directed towards my public IP, say either https://nextcloud.foo.bar or 123.45.67.89, towards my server's local IP instead, say 192.168.1.2. Basically, I'm trying to MitM myself. DNS entries will not work because my devices use a secure DNS.
 I was hoping to discover a setting similar to port triggers, except for IPs instead of ports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently set up my own personal Pleroma instance as I wanted to run my own single user instance. I was able to install Pleroma on the VPS and it runs without errors. When trying to move & follow others on other servers, it can show their profile but not their posts and when trying to follow, the follow functionality doesn't work.
 I also tried to find my own profile on my new Pleroma instance but other instances can't seem to find my instance at all saying it doesn't exist. I also tried to register my instance on instances.social as a test and it errors out saying that there's no Mastodon or Pleroma instance found on my hostname.
 Federation seems to be enabled but I'm not sure if it's actually working. I initially thought that running through Cloudflare was an issue but I disabled the proxy and that didn't fix the issue...
 I'm a Pleroma/Mastodon admin newbie and I'm not sure if I'm missing anything here. Anything assistance is much appreciated.

 It's not possible to use the "Multi file organize/Custom filters" to move all the files to a new directory. All directories needs to be kept as they are.

 I open dummy ssh on port 22, if someone tries to connect I want to give IP ban on my router (pfSense, I may move to opnSense).
 In this case no other services can be probed. Is it possible to set it up without magic?

 Features I'm looking for
  
Add one-off tasks
 Set up recurring tasks
 Have reminders or some kind of "jobs to do today" mobile page or similar
 Two users so my other half can help
 Can run via Docker as easily as possible i.e. there are pre-built images on a registry and all I gotta do is run them, have found a few but I have to compile my own images or clone a github and faff and fiddle - and that's a level of skill & concentration I can't manage :(
  
I have add and I humungously struggle with starting and completing tasks but I have worked in IT for decades and when I had a helpdesk ticket I could always GTD. So hoping something similar can help my private life.
 It doesn't have to be a specific task management / to-do software, it could be a FOSS Service Desk / Ticket System which also has a Task management module, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey homelab, I've recently needed some additional storage and thought it was time to hack together a NAS to last me a few years until I have the budget for something nicer. Digging into my spare parts box, I managed to find four 1 TB HDDs (two internal drives and two old externals that are not in use) as well as a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB). 
 I was thinking of somehow connecting these together and have the Pi control them. Three of the drives would host media/documents and the fourth would work as a backup of just the most critical files. Should I set these in some sort of RAID array? 
 In terms of hardware, I've seen some four-bay HDD enclosures/docks such as these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2WRB97
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L7PSWV9
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUSU8MI
 Would this be sufficient for my needs and do I need to purchase anything else? Alternatively I have an old tower with a water-damaged motherboard that I could chuck everything into if that's a better option.
 My other questions were with regards to the OS. I'm really only looking to set up Jellyfin and Vaultwarden via Docker. Is it worth considering a NAS distro such as OMV or TrueNAS? Or should I just go with Raspbian and create a SMB share? It's only me using this and I don't plan to configure anything fancy so I'm leaning towards the latter...
 Appreciate any feedback and advice, thanks in advance!

 I just (finally) decided to build my homelab and my question is about how safe it is to plug everything in the bedroom have allocated for this.
 The room has a total of 4 wall sockets.
 My hardware:
  
3 HP Z800 with 2 x 6c/12t, 96Gb, 3 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 HP Z820 with 2 x 8c/16t, 256Gb, 4 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 DELL T7600 with 2 x 8c/16t, 256Gb, 4 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 NAS (DIY) with 4c/8t i7, 32GB, 4 HDD, 1 SSD, 1 NVME and 1 x540-t2 card
 my workstation with 8c/16t, 64Gb, 2 x 1080ti, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 2 x 8 ports 10G-base-t switches
  
This lab with be used a my personal cloud with Openstack, Proxmox, Ceph, OpnSense, Truenas. All this for Kubernetes mostly.
 Is that too much load for 2 sockets? As the other 2 are on the other side of the room or I should spread on the 4 of them? I’m just worried about fire risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run a honeypot on my home network and visualize the logs it collects for a personal project. I understand the risks, so before I open anything up to the internet, I want to come up with a plan that will maximize security given the situation. Here's my plan so far:
  
Honeypot is on its own piece of hardware (RPi, NUC, not sure yet)
 Honeypot is in a DMZ (router has an option for this, but from what I've gathered, it'd basically just be a single-firewall DMZ)
 Vulnerable apps/services/etc. would each run in their own Docker container, which would have AppArmor profiles configured for them based on their capabilities
 Instead of running on the honeypot host directly, all Docker containers containing vulnerable things would run in an LXC container (or possibly a VM, not sure which would be better)
 VM/LXC container would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the Docker containers; host device would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the VM/LXC container
  
What do you think of my plan so far? I'm a complete novice, so please let me know what can be improved and what you'd do differently or add.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently acquired a second-hand Synology DS218 and am trying to find out how best to use it. I see a lot of people on here mentioning that they do indeed have some kind of Synology DS, but never mention any of the apps provided by Synology.
 For the following intention, do you even boot DSM (and what do you do next to, e.g., install and then run photoprism/lychee/librephoto or nextcloud or jellyfin)?
 What I'd like to set up, is 1. a file server to share with my family and maybe a few friends, 2. a photo server where my family members can all upload their images and then share specific albums or pictures with specific outside people, restricting unintended people from access, 3. syncing our contact lists, so I don't need to register contacts my wife has already added, 4. aggregating all the digital music from my family members, 5. shared task management and "project" organizing, 6. co-journaling 7. a postgresql db (that should be higher up there...) 8.9.10.11. etc.
 I am looking into port forwarding to make all of this accessible from the outside, but I've already found out this isn't trivial at all. I'll get there, I'm confident.
 Where do I start? Install software like nextcloud and docker through DSM and continue from there or do you circumvent DSM completely and ... ? Well, what, actually? or do you use any of the Synology software, and if yes, what are your experiences?
 I am not a programmer, but know how to RTFM and I am pretty patient and happy to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)
 I'm based in Europe and I've just setup a small cloud storage service.
 A short story about my initial thoughts on this project:
 I've been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I've noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).
 All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren't many affordable (mind you, $5-$7/TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.
 So I've decided to make a little project to "fix" this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?). I've had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.
 I'm basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.
 Requesting Feedback:
 I'm offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(
 You can check it out here.
 I'm already working on the next phase (the first one wasn't anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think it can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)
 Thank you for your time! 
 Tom
 PS: I've got approval from the moderators to post this thread.
 PS2: I've made a similar post on Hacker News earlier today, just a small FYI.

 Problem 1: Getting video from the PS5 in their game room to the TV in the livingroom. Pretty easily solved with Monoprice HDMI over IP encoder/decoders. Luckily I ran ethernet everywhere when we remodeled a few years ago. I can add additional decoders to other rooms.
 Problem 2: PlayStation consoles use Bluetooth for controller connectivity. Since these devices were designed to be used in the same room, the range isn’t all that great. This required pulling the case apart to install a pair of external antennas.
 NOTE: You do need hardwired Ethernet at any location where you are installing an encoder/decoder.
 All parts below. Maybe $130 total.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just looking for an enclosure to hold 2 3.5" drives. They don't even need to be raid, just independent. Just trying to keep them safe. 
 It seems like they are all expensive, and it's hard to find one with a cooling fan. 
 Do I really need a cooling fan? The data is important and cannot be lost, so longevity and reliability is important. Just not sure if drives can actually get that hot or if it affects reliability. 
 Looking to get something for like $80 or less. Seems tough to find. But I can't have something that kills one of my drives. I figured something like a raid enclosure should be relatively simple to manufacture...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me, been cycling through a couple of the usual suspects for years now. But I'm getting tired - been at this for almost 30 years - and am ready to hang up the hat, let the horse loose, and settle on the rocker....in other words, ready to stop tearing down and rebuilding the lab every few months with a new hypervisor. So, I'm kind of curious what you all use at home, and what you use to manage it. So far, been through:
 - ESX (Welcome to a new version! You know all that hardware you carefully curated to work with me? as of this release I now support none of it! Enjoy the upgrade!)
 - Hyper-V Server (You can create virtual machines after you domain join me. Oh...you have no domain? Ok, I can still work, once you set up constrained delegation....and the default client config doesn't work without modifications...and I no longer support the out-of-box cypher suites without several config settings...you sure you don't have a domain?)
 - ProxMox (Wanna buy a license? Wanna buy a license? How about a license? Hey, sexy mama...wanna buy a ProxMox license?)
 - OpenStack (Have you got 14 extra server chassis lying around? Good. Let's begin)
 - and KVM (Welcome to the command line! The default setup does almost but not quite what you, personally want. Enjoy these twenty copy/pasted blog posts and have fun with these command line tools with 400 different settings!)
 That was all fun for awhile, but I'm wanting to use my home lab and not just rebuild it endlessly (and yes, I wanted to rebuild it endlessly....that was part of the fun). So, I'm curious, all of you...what do you use day to day, and how much does the rest of what everyone else's choice suck? :)

 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February I picked up an OWC Mercury Elite Pro external enclosure for pretty cheap, as it was open-box. It's a dual drive enclosure with USB 3 and eSATA connections, fairly well built with an aluminum body and fan in the back, and - importantly - has a hardware RAID controller so it can run your 2 disks individually, in Span mode, or in RAID 0 or 1.
 Thanks to Black Friday, I nabbed 2 10TB WD Red Plus drives for a good price, and my intent is to stick them in the OWC, run them in RAID 1 for mirroring, and then connecting the enclosure to a Thin Client PC over USB 3, and then installing Debian to the Thin Client to run everything I need - Plex, backups, maybe some minor game server hosting and file serving.
 The OWC's RAID seems fully featured, if one of the mirrored drives dies, all you need to do is insert a new identical drive and it will automatically rebuild (I would obviously still back up the remaining good drive before initiating the rebuild), I'm just wondering if it sounds like a good idea. On one hand, USB 3 is a very fast standard, but on the other, it feels weird to be running a 10TB mirrored NAS over a single USB cable. Maybe it's a common setup, and I'm just new to this, but I was looking for some reassurance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: So I want to upgrade my SuperMicro board. I would need to get a Intel board (quick sync for plex) and preferably a new 13th gen CPU (delay the need to upgrade). Now I am not opposed to getting a 10G LAN card if that saves me money but I would like to maintain 2x 10GB ports like I have now. I will need to get an HBA card that will give me enough SATA for 15 drives, but there are many posts on this subreddit on which to get, so no issues there. This server will need to handle 8 transcodes simultaneously and at times 4-5 of those will be 4k video's.
 Help: Should I stay with a server board to maintain ECC or is DDR5's sudo ECC enough?
 Help: Are there any boards under $600 with 13th gen support and ECC support?
 Help: Are there even any server boards that support 13th gen?
 Notes: If I am making any wrong assumptions or am crazy with what I am looking for please help me and point in the right direction.

 is the following backup scenario kinda “overkill” for personal usage?
  
Data is stored on a RAID10 (4 disks)
 Every day a backup gets created of the RAID10 - Backup gets stored on a RAID1 - same location
 Another backup gets created which has a different location. (RAID1)
  
Do you think the RAID1 setup is necessary or just “overkill”? 
 Note: - RAID10 data pool size is 8TB (4x4TB) - RAID1 setup is also 8TB (2x 8TB) - Hardware price is ~1500€, too expensive? (Seagate IronWolf Pro)

 After a friend recently moved away, and inheriting her homelab I was able to obtain:
 25u Startech server rack
 Mikrotik CRS-317
 Mikrotik CSS-426
 Rack mounted application hosting server
 Rack mounted 36TB hosted storage
 Rack mounted Gaming PC
 Don't have all the specs written down, but it's a really good start for me.
 Things I'm looking to host:
 Proxmox
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 Heimdall
 Pterodactyl.io(game server host & manager)
 ???
 ------------------
 Any thoughts before I get too deep into trying to set things up?
 Currently using Cloudflare as a proxy for my public IP, and routing for subdomains.
 Will probably have a firewall/router at the front of the network, to route traffic to a public facing network hosting a website, game servers, and other services I plan to offer through a main site on my domain. Separately, my private network with gaming PCs for my roommate and I, and a shared gaming pc on the network rack.
 Part of my network is ready for 10gig, and with AT&T, I can upgrade my 1gig to 5gig at minimal cost.
 Viable to offer online services for game server hosting? I will eventually move to colocation or obtain redundant internet/solar for the rack and connections.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to plan on building a new NAS with ECC. Currently, I have am using an old gaming desktop I had for a NAS. Just learned about the importance of ECC, for data, and want to start planning on building for it. Can anyone recommend a good combo of hardware that is current? I am planning on using my old desktop case and PSU.
 Budget is preferably under $1k for the whole thing if needing a new case, etc.
 Currently, researching on my own, it seems like possible choices for a motherboard would be either a Asrock b450 (although I don't know what version/model) or a ASRock X470D4U AMD AM4 X470. Not sure what brand/type of memory and CPU I should be using or if there is other motherboard I should consider? Thanks in advance.

I can also confirm my SATA cable and PSU cables are good, as they work with a WD 4TB Blue. SATA set to AHCI. But when I plug in the X16 the drive doesn't even spin up on boot.

 Is there something picky with this drive/mobo combo? Why does it work externally but not plugged into my mobo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there!
 I have recently gotten a good deal on a cpu, mobo, case, and psu from a friend.
 My plan for the hardware is to turn it into a nas / plex / minecraft server and probably run a discord bot or two.
 But I have a few questions:
 - How big should by boot drive be? would a 32 gb nvme optane drive do?
 - How do I access this server? it'll be at my parents place since I don't want the noise in my living room
 - What os should I run?
 - should I have 16 or 32 gb of ram?
 For the NAS I plan on running 2 8 tb hdd's in raid 1 since that's what my budget allows for, specifically two Seagate Exos 7E8. and then probably a decently sized ssd for the minecraft server so like 500 gb or something. The cpu will be an intel i5 8400 and networking will just be gigabit as both my parents and I have gigabit fiber networking.
 Thank you for your help in advance I hope to post a pic of the final product

And I'm not sure its possible to make another usable clone from a USB drive to SATA drive if the original windows drive was to fail.
 I would expect a USB to SATA connector could potentially fix the problem, but I also don't know (rookie) if I would have to use the USB to SATA connector as I was making the clone, or if I can attach a SATA convertor after making a clone only with the use of a USB connection.
 Im using Macrium Reflect Free.
 If keeping backups of windows isnt considered data-hoarding, my bad.

 Don't have much to work with, just a Fios G3100 router and Windows Server 2016 running on an Unraid box. My understanding is that Windows Server needs to also run DHCP server to also be a Domain Controller. Won't this conflict with my Fios router or it all depends on where I set up the DHCP server on the Fios router that would be the primary choice when devices connect to the network?
 ​
  
If i had to make the Windows Server the primary router, what would happen if the Windows Server goes offline?
 Or would I be better off making the Fios router range 2-200 and then set the range on WInServer to 202-240? and then manually setting the default Gateway (on the devices that'll be connecting to the domain) to the WinServer? 
 Is the right strategy to just put the Windows Server on its own subnet, like what do y'all do? I used to have a Unifi setup but short on space at the moment so I'm familiar with this, but is there any way to have a failover DHCP server?

 Currently, all that stuff is handled in Evernote, but if possible, I'd like to leave behind the world of proprietary systems for that task.
 Any advice?

 ​
 I have a NextCloud instance on my old laptop (the AIO version, in Docker) with an external URL. I set up port forwarding and a static IP for it. I've now set up a Jellyfin instance (also docker, this time with docker-compose) on the same device, and I want to be able to access it, but only within the network. The problem is that I can't get to it from other devices on the network. I tried 196.168... and 196.168...:8096 or 8920. 
 On Firefox, I get "Secure Connection Failed" for all versions. It keeps redirecting to https, though. I don't know if http would work, but I tried from the Jellyfin android app as well and all its "candidates" (including http) failed. I assume that it's because of some conflict with the NextCloud instance, but I don't really know how to even debug that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article on ServeTheHome got me thinking... in a RAID array where periodic "scrubs" or consistency checks are recommended to prevent bit rot, the entire disk has to be read. 
 I did some quick math for my own array which uses HGST He10 10TB drives with 550TB/yr rated workload and the default MegaRAID settings of weekly consistency check AND patrol read, resulting in
 10TB * 2 * 52 = 1040TB/yr read
 While doing both of them monthly instead is
 10TB * 2 * 12 = 240TB/yr read, leaving 310TB/yr for actually using the drives
 I searched to see if anyone else had posted here or on other forums about this concern and couldn't find anything. Should I reduce the frequency to monthly to avoid 'wearing out' the drives, or is a weekly check needed to prevent bit rot on high capacity drives?
 EDIT: thanks for all the data points confirming monthly check is okay! I was going by some old threads like this one which scared me into thinking I needed to keep the weekly default. I've switched mine to monthly now.

Logged in to see what was happening and a filesystem was missing, a disc too. Check documentation to see what disc had failed and what was in it and saw it was no valuable data and though I could just buy a new HDD and copy over the backup. Went to check other applications on the same machine and realized docker was running but not the containers. The disc where I mount all my docker volumes and keep the docker compose files is gone too. Backup discs also gone. Ups logs show no power failure. 4hddw decided to die on me the same day.
 Let's hope I can find a nice deal tomorrow on HDD or I'll be taking a break from hosting my stuff at home. 
 Check you backups and smart status. And backup at least your config elsewhere.
 I'm down and feel pretty dumb right now.

 The point is to have a private server, non federated but using Element's integration manager. But for these tests I tried to run in federated anyway but it still did not work.
 We can connect to Synapse just fine, chat with each other, send files etc. Location also works, only Integration manager fails to connect.

 Posting about MyNixOS here for the first time. This is a tool I've been working on to help build and share Nix and NixOS configurations. Nix is a powerful tool to deploy software in a reproducible way, and with NixOS you can control your whole operating system through a declarative configuration.
 Starting out with Nix was exciting, but it definitely had a challenging learning curve. This made me start building a website focused on making it easier to create and share Nix flakes, which are the core unit of software deployment in Nix.
 Using the website, you can create flakes without knowing the Nix configuration language, as the necessary Nix files are generated for you. I hope this can be useful for those interested in trying out Nix for self-hosting. I'm currently us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is more a docker question than a selfhosting one but I hope that maybe someone knows this specific docker container so here we are...
 I'm using the docker hub image for Kanboard: https://hub.docker.com/r/kanboard/kanboard
 The issue I'm having is that the data and plugins volume files/folders do get assigned odd user and group permissions on the host. I understand why but I can't find a way to change them.
 Specifics:
  
From inside the container the nginx:nginx user/group have userid (UID) 100 and groupid (GID) 101.
 On the host UID 100 is assigned to user _apt, GID 101 is assigned to group systemd-journal. 
 So this user/group combination is being set for all files / folders from the volumes.
  
Things I've tried:
  
It doesn't make a difference if I mount them as volumes or bind the folder.
 There doesn't seem to be a way to pass UID and GID in the docker compose file as environment variables.
 Setting user in the compose file through user: "${UID}:${GID}" does change UID/GID of the container root user, not nginx.
  
Does anyone have an idea how to correct the file permissions on the host without building my own docker image?

 I have a novice question. 
 Do 3.5" drives that are used to write once and accessed once every blue moon because they are stored elsewhere have more durability than one inside a system that has daily usage or it does not matter?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! My name is Noah, and I am looking for an apprenticeship in Network Engineering, ideally in the East Midlands, U.K. This would be once I have finished Year 13 in June, so starting around August/September 2023. 
 Interested in anything from ISPs, Large Enterprises, and MSPs. Indifferent to vendors as starting afresh - Juniper, Cisco, whatever! I own a little HomeLab, made up of Cisco Routers/Switches, and a WLC. I study L3 BTEC IT, L3 BTEC Business, Geography, and did an AS in Core Maths last year. Predicted grades are excellent. 
 If you or your employer can offer me an apprenticeship, or if you have any contacts, I can happily provide my CV and Cover Letter - just send me a DM or email me at hello@nturneruk.com. Thanks! 🙂

I’m trying to help a couple friends get started in data hoarding and self hosting. Since I have a good stock of old spinners and the mini-PC’s that I am using don’t have internal SATA slots, I was hoping to buy some external enclosures for cheap to keep their costs down. I’d recommend that you keep a couple enclosures for Warranty returns but if you have extras let me know. Thanks for your time. If this post violates any rules, I am extremely sorry and will delete it immediately.
 Edit: I was asked to include my location since I am asking if people are willing to ship items. I am located in Florida USA. Thanks for checking out the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I would share my experience if it helps others in Australia with a similar experience.
 I shucked a Seagate 5TB Hard Drive I purchased from Amazon Australia on July 2022. It was in my Unraid server and now refuses to power up at all, completely dead. 
 I tried to use the return process on the Amazon site, but it doesn't work since its outside of the 30 day return window. Since the drive itself has a 2 year warranty, I contacted chat. They gave me a standard auto reply of "You need to go back to the manufacturer for the warranty" which is not how it works in Australia (in Australian consumer law, the retailer cannot refer you to the manufacturer or importer for warranty repairs). I replied with this information, and the chat officer offered to have someone higher up call me on my phone.
 I received the phone call, and the phone support was perfectly fine. I told them I needed to return a drive for warranty, but it was outside of the 30 days, but still has a 2 year warranty, and that I am in Australia, and purchased from Amazon Australia and needed to use them for the warranty. He accepted it straight away, and sent me a brand new 5TB Seagate Drive (he asked if I wanted a refund or replacement, but since I use it I went with replacement).
 All done and dusted, completely swapped under warranty! Not sure how it works in other countries, but in Australia the manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that shucking the drive caused the failure before they can reject a warranty, and retailer are required to work with the consumer to facilitate the warranty process (they cannot refer to manufacturer).
 If you are in Australia and need to refer to the specific detail around manufacturers warranties, just send them this: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-bought/repair-replace-refund-cancel

 version: 3.3 services: mosquitto: image: eclipse-mosquitto container_name: mosquitto volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/mosquitto_data/data:/mosquitto/data - /var/lib/docker/volumes/mosquitto_data/log:/mosquitto/log - /var/lib/docker/volumes/mosquitto_data/certs:/mosquitto/config/certs - /var/lib/docker/volumes/mosquitto_data/config:/mosquitto/config ports: - 1883:1883 - 9001:9001 restart: unless-stopped 
 It took me months to set up everything so your help is much appreciated!

Looking to upgrade my networking gear. I love the Unifi UI and easy setup but everything they have seems to be on back order at the moment. I don't mind spending a little extra to get what I want but just looking for something that has an easy to use UI. Any suggestions?
 Also currently I am running Docker on one PC, a few VM's on a different server, and finally I have my plex server on a different device. So 3 main servers in my rack currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, I've been labbing for a while now and have just ignored the dreaded untrusted site message as I haven't had a need. Well I decided to rebuild the labs software stack from the ground up, new DC, new OPNsense install, new everything really. As part of this I finally bit the bullet and bought a domain instead of using no-ip. 
 So after buying the domain, wasting half a day realizing that Google Domains does not use Google Cloud DNS, converting my nameservers to Cloudflare, building a webserver, and configuring certbot I now have a wildcard cert for my domain. Yay!
 I manually imported the key into OPNsense, and hooray, the secure connection lock is there, I did it! Now what? I have all the *arr's to configure, my Windows domain environment, a bunch of ESXi hosts and vCenter, etc. Is there a way that I'm missing to manage and automate the updating of certs across all these services? Across any of the services? Is it really that once a certificate is issued its your job to apply it to any service you want to use it? 
 I feel like I'm missing the whole management after issuing part... help me out here folks.

 So I thought I'd check my storage space, which reports this:

 What's going on here? CrystalDisk Info says the drive is in good health, so why have I suddenly lost space and what's the warning of reduced resiliancy all about?
 I'm pretty new to this stuff, so I'm quite confused here - any help is appreciated.In the meantime, I'm moving what I can over to another drive that has free space. 
 EDIT: Wait no, that last disk doesn't show up in CrystalDisk Info, but the others are.
 I'd try unplugging and replugging it in, but not sure it seems worth the risk here.

AllHDD has it listed at $489 but with the wrong warranty & poor English in the listing. When I called to confirm it was the right HDD yesterday they left me on hold for 15 min while they "called the warehouse" so I hung up.
 AAAWAVE accepts both PayPal & Amazon Pay, so those of you with PayPal Credit &/or an Amazon credit card can have 6 - 12 months with no interest to pay off the purchase. 
 I own the 18 TB DC HC550 & have had a great experience with it, so I feel confident about the DC HC570. Yes, there are less expensive HDDs out there, but for those of us who have less space than funds & are fairly demanding of our HDDs this is a great way to get massive storage in a small footprint.
 1 The only other 22+ TB non-SMR HDD on the market is the Western Digital Gold which I have not been able to find for less than its 599.99 USD MSRP anywhere. It appears WD uses the same tech in both, with the exception that the Ultrastar has an SE (Secure Erase) functionality.

 But they dont claim to have linux support and the reviews for linux are mixed. 
 Does anyone have something similar like this to recommend for Linux?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 I'm trying to cobble together a half functional system using hardware I've obtained for free from businesses and recycling centers, and I'm looking for some advice on how to hook up an odd assortment of hdds to my bizarre server setup and create a half decent NAS.
 So far I have an HP z2 mini g3 (i7 6700, 32GB ram, 256GB SSD) I was given by a friends workplace who didn't need it, and a massive bunch of drives I got from a recycling center (don't worry I tested and scrubbed them all).
 At the moment I'm messing with Ubuntu server on the z2 to learn, but planning to switch over to Truenas Scale and create a nice little ZFS Pool when I start storing data. This is really my only server head option atm as don't have the Budget for a new system
 My main issue is: how tf do I hook up all my drives? I have: 4x 4TB 3x 3TB 2x 2TB ~14x (lol) 1TB
 All 3.5in SATA HDDs
 The z2 has a bunch of 10gbit usb ports but not much else. So far I've looked at using an external USB jbod enclosure such as the sabrent 10 bay one, but am totally open to ideas for how to connect server grade hardware to this thing.
 How would you do it? 
 Happy to experiment and put up with a reasonable amount of jank, or to try more complex solutions too!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I've been thinking of "upgrading" to a proper server for some time for my home services. I currently run everything out of an old laptop (4th i7 from 2014 w/ 16GB RAM) and it's fine, but I'd like a more dedicated machine. More specifically, I'd like to do some large-scale network automation exercises, so to run CML2 or GNS3 I would ideally like 128GB of RAM, but 64GB would be a minimum.
 I've found most mini PC's can get up to 16/32, but not as many with 64 or 128. Any good recommendations ahead of Cyber Monday?
 My budget is preferably <$500. I can pull 32GB of DDR4 from my desktop (and upgrade in the process) and I have SSD's/M.2 drives, so I'm not concerned about storage. Thanks!
 Edit: I think I may have found one that might fit my needs - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NKQQSQP/ref=emc_b_5_i?th=1
 I'm thinking worst case, if I outgrow it, I can easily turn this thing into a replacement for my Raspberry Pi retro gaming station.

I came across these two seeing their price and reviews. 
 One is the 2TB WD easystore at BB and the other is this Lacie HD at Apple, I was also looking into the Lacie Rugged. I can get this one for 60 because of a discount.
 Any one can recommend any of these, or anything else? I am open to suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Denizens of r/DataHoarder
 I just bought 2x14tb WD drives, that I'm adding to my NAS, which is running OMV. It currently only has an 8tb drive in it, on EXT4, which is almost out of space.
 I've been looking into snapraid-btrfs and snapraid-btrfs-runner.
 This and Mergerfs seems to be the perfect combination for my use case of mainly media storage(and maybe a steam cache later) on mixed drive sizes.
 But this is my first time even having enough data/drives to even have to worry about parity/bitrot, so i want to make sure I do it right the first time.
 I have a few things I want to make sure I'm understanding properly.
 1) So in Snapraid, a 'Sync' is basically creating/updating the parity data on the parity drive. Does updating a parity file go faster if little to nothing has changed on the data drives?
 2) Snapraid 'Scrubs' periodically check the integrity of a file based off of the Parity data, and timestamp. Still don't exactly get how this one works
 3) Snapraid Sync will fail if anything is writing to the drives. Snapraid-btrfs gets around this by having Snapraid take a snapshot of btrfs's Read Only snapshots. No idea if that's correct.
 4) Using Mergerfs and btrfs on my 8tb + 14tb drives, I can fill each drive rather evenly, without striping files. I can use my second 14tb to store the parity file created by Snapraid-btrfs. This should be pretty protected against bitrot, and the rare drive failure, right?(other than files lost between a sync and a failure)
 Sorry this is so long winded. I appreciate any insight :)

 I see 2 options. 
 A- 1 disk dedicated to each VM
 B- 4 disks with RAID0 or any stripping option, pooled together and the pool is used by the 4 VMs. 
 Option B makes more sense in terms of storage. 
 But in terms of pure performance, which one do you think is better ?
 Edit 1: Additional information: - The 4 VMs are desktops. - 99% tiny files constantly read and written. - each ssd is directly connected in sata to the motherboard. - all ssd are in the 370-450 MB/s speed range (simple hdparm test speed) - I do not want any redundancy. Just max speed.

I tried compressing a small 49GB set with 7zip and it compressed to 12GB. These are the RAW files that aren't used too often (they are mostly processed and the processed version is what we used. however, since they are data, we want to keep the raw files too). Is there any downside to compressing the raws, and deleting the raws after to save space? I saw couple of posts but most dealt with low compression ratios and not worth it. But i think saving 60-70% in my case might be. I am just worried about unforseen comsequences i might not be aware of. Like accessing files, likelihood or corruption or whatnot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sorry, I am new in all of this and I am not from english speaking country, so I apologize if I say something incorrect.
 I would like to ask you for a advice, because I am bit lost in this scenario:
 In my computer, I have this three drivers, encrypted by BitLocker: 
  
A: 500GB SSD - Samsung 860 EVO
 B: 1TB HDD - WD 1003FZEX
 C: 10TB HDD - WD 102KRYZ
  
OS: Windows 11 Pro
 Motherboard: MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4
 Would it be possible, to mirror the drive A to the drive C through some kind of a software, where if needed, I would create a basic partition on the drive C so it would be the same size with the drive A. The same scenario I would like to use for the drive B to C, same as A to C. But the data on drive A are the most critical for me and I would like them to survive the trial of time with naively ideally no corruption and so on.
 I understand backups are vital in this, but one of the problems at this time is money, so unfortunately right now, something like NAS is out of question for me. (Note: The 102KRYZ. It was a gift from colleague of mine.) Second problem is, if bit rot happens, even with backups, I will have no idea about it and the backups would get overwritten through time, so ideally, the software for the mirroring should check for checksum, if I understand it correctly.
 Space in the PC is basically taken, so adding later another 500GB SSD would be a bit difficult. Thats why I would like to ask about this scenario and how I could utilize the setup I have to the best of capabilities in protecting my data. 
 If this scenario is impossible, then maybe, is there a software for just plainly generating checksum and warning the user, if the files gets corrupted, so you could overwrite it from the backup from other drivers? Just a thought.
 I will be very thankful for any idea, answer or anything to my problem. Thank you if you read my post and If I may, I wish you a very nice day.

 First of all, I'm just a hobbyist trying new things. I've taught myself the very basics of Debian and Docker, and I'm not a native English speaker. So bear with me if I mention or say silly stuff.
 I was willing to ditch Duplicati as I just had my second corrupt database in a couple of months and I also find it desperately slooooow.
 As I mentioned above, I'm a real noob, so I was looking for a FOSS alternative with a GUI of some sort as CLI is not my cup of tea (I still have to get confortable with it and I don't have much time for this now).
 I decided to try Kopia that has the wind in its sails at the moment. From my beginner's perspective, it isn't as polished as I'd like, but it's fast and powerful. So here I am, after 3 weeks hardly working to understand how to run it, with…]]></summary>

Is there an open source alternative that achieves the same?

I'm not tied to using Jellyfin but it would be nice.
 I have looked at Sonos speakers but apparently they come with Alexa built in.

 I'm sorry if this is a silly question but after perusing the "about", the wiki and searching through here I'm not sure exactly what to search for what I want. 
 I currently run a Plex Media server and use it for movie / tv. I can download stuff to my devices, stream, etc. 
 I would like to create the same thing for ebooks but more importantly audiobooks. I would like to run it from Windows. It seems most things around here run on Linux and that is something I'm not comfortable with unfortunately. Any thoughts or am I asking for a unicorn? 
 Thanks!

 It looks like the big players are: * SWAG - https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag * NGINX Proxy Manager - https://nginxproxymanager.com/ * Traefik - https://traefik.io/
 So here I am looking for some reviews and Pros/Cons from the community. What do you use/like and why? 
 Me personally, I work in tech, but focus windows side. Limited experience with Linux, Docker, Web, Networking, so not an expert in this realm, but happy to learn. Thanks!

 Are there any selfhosted eye-candy type of apps out there? Geiss in a browser window, screensaver type stuff, or just general cute/interesting animations that can be accessed from systems/devices on the network?
 I can think of many different ways to accomplish this and I may just end up making something myself. However, I'd love to see what's out there first! 
 Thanks for any recommendations, you all have a great weekend! I'll just be here jamming out to 90s music in WinAmp.. the way it was intended by everyone except Lars. IYKYK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've not long started putting together my own little lab and want to ensure I am putting security first as while lurking I've read many horror stories.
 I'm running a small server that I put together myself (I'll post specs in a comment below).
 On this server I am currently running Proxmox with 1 VM and 1 LXC.
 The VM is running Ubuntu Server 22.04 (Minimal Install) and atm is only running Home Assistant via Docker with a couple of other containers that are used within HA.
 The LXC is just a monitoring tool I am running to check the Ubiquiti store as I can never seem to get a G4 Pro Doorbell as scalpers will be scalpers.
 After installing the Ubuntu VM I have a list of tasks I carried out to aid in the security first approach:
  
Setup unattended-upgrades
 Configure SSH via keys using ed25519
 Disable password access to SSH
 Install and setup basic rules for UFW and Fail2Ban
 Disable root login.
  
The same steps are applied to the actual Proxmox server where possible (Disable root login wasn't possible).
 ​
 Going forward I am looking to expand and add Plex or Jellyfin that would ideally be accessible externally (I know, not exactly security first here). I hear a lot about using reverse proxies, VPNs etc but its not an area I am familiar with and many YouTube videos seems to explain it differently so I have chickened out for the time being as not to get it wrong.
 Finally I am debating if there is a need to create another Ubuntu VM to installer another instance of Docker for all my other future applications so I can keep Home Assistant and its companion containers segregated.
 ​
 Apologies for the long and boring post.
 TLDR
 Newb labber, using Proxmox, trying to keep secure.
 Using HA, expanding to external access Plex/Jelli.
 Seeking advice on ReverseProxy/VPN and other security tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking to selfhost numerous things. I picked up a Beelink SEi12 yesterday for $350, comes with 16gb of ram and 500gb storage.
 I currently use my PC to serve Plex to my family, but am looking to move that to the Beelink (I got the SEi12 instead of a Ryzen box to take advantage of QuickSync). I'm also looking to host my own Bitwarden, Lightning wallet, DNS, usenet, cloud storage... basically anything I can.
 I use 3.5" HDDs to store video and large files. Obviously those will not fit inside the little Beelink. Whats the best solution for housing HDDs? Would a DS220j work? Or something similar?
 TLDR; setting up first home server. Best way to attach storage (NAS? Just external drives by USB?) to something like a Beelink SEi12? Appreciate any advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have now a handful of users and I'm looking for a directory-based solution that would run on kubernetes. It should have functionality to allow users to restore their passwords and an admin UI.
 What do you recommend? FreeIPA seems to be a resource hog but the best one I've seen so far.
 Should I use a cloud provider like jumphost, that allows for 10 free users?
 Any other cool projects or recommendations?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all so I'm taking the leap and going to buy a rack. I am looking for two cases, one to transfer my NAS into so it should have a few drive bays I've seen quite a few online and I'm pretty happy with some of them, but I'm also considering putting my PC into the rack as well so that I have ample space on my desk. So I have a couple of questions regarding this:
  
The case, I see a lot of server cases but they all have lots of HDD slots and are kind of overkill from what I can see, maybe I should be looking for a 2U or 3U for a PC case. I would like to make sure I can fit whatever available GPU I have and maybe some things like NIC cards or other pcie devices and don't want to end up restricted. I'd be inserting a regular ATX motherboard.
 
Will this work? I want to have some kind of small type c device on my desk that will deal with monitors mouse etc connecting back to the server rack (same room not too far) and maybe even type c powered monitors for a very minimal cabling job.
 
 I keep getting caught in a googling loop with type c docking stations when I look for devices that essentially just give me all the ports I'd need over type c so maybe someone has a better idea of what these are called.

I currently have the H200 perc card in my R710 but I'm not sure exactly what I need for this case in order to use the SAS drives properly between the chassis and the MOBO I choose.

I also sometimes wish transcoding worked a bit faster with my nas on some files so I won’t have buffering. Not a common problem. My question is should I go with a bigger nas, just get an expansion bay, or is it time to go custom? I’ve built many pcs but I’ve never messed with Linux or other nas software. None of the data is critical, but I would like to keep some form of raid in case a drive fails. Anyone have any opinions or tips for me?

I see a lot of posts here and on Home Lab about virtualization. As a techie by trade this seems like overkill to me for my needs. Dockerizing everything seems fine but I didn’t know if there were added benefits to virtualizing over this. With a pretty simple machine (specs not on hand), would virtualizing kill my resources where they should just be running in Docker?
 Idk. Just really confused and looking for general reasons why to choose virtualization, docker, everything all on one is, etc.

 online editing
 don't have that red section (which almost every wiki with the above requirements contains)!
 fast (confluence is lagging when you have big documentation)
  
good to have:

 db support
  
Unfortunately, I don't like bookstack. I can't convince myself of its ui.

 For that I wanted to see if there is some kind of selfhosted flatshare tool. The basic things Id like to have it do is chore managment (ideally with some kind of automatic redistribution if someone is on holiday and not just a set date but a timespan in which the chorse should be completed) and some kind money & shared groceries managment (for example every week someone else is supposed to buy toilet paper and gets a reminder but somebody could also do it for them and then the amount owed is added to the money balancer) and finally maybe some kind of shared note taking.
 Does anything like this exist already, I havet found anything on my search so far. It could also be a couple different services, as long as its easy to use in house for non-technical people :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered the whole world of Docker containers and I find them extremely useful for quickly deploying and managing stuff, however, it's a bit painful to be manually ssh-ing into the machines and adding a docker compose or running the containers, plus configuring them to run on reboot etc.
 Is there anything to manage this kind of stuff across multiple nodes? So I can, let's say, have now 3 machines but in the future add some more and manage their containers from some UI or something.
 Thanks in advance.
 EDIT: After seeing lots of comments and wrapping my head around Portainer, Kubernetes even Podman, I think for now I'm going to go with Portainer because:
 1- It seems simpler, since it's just Docker and I've been using that for the past months
 2- Kubernetes seems more suitable when you need to manage a cluster and big stuff, add like HA to your services, and overall, too complex for my use case. However, I really liked the idea, and I'll definitely try it out for fun when I have some time
 3- Also I've seen that regarding memory usage, Kubernetes tend to hog more than plain Docker, and that's a concern for me since I plan on using Raspberrys for now (or at least until I have enough money to get a decent home server)
 Thanks again to all of you that commented, I have still a lot to learn!

 Therefore i want to upgrade to either - a newer version raspberry like rpi 4b 8gb - an alternative like odroid H3+ - or a thin client like - Fujitsu Esprimo Q920 0-Watt Intel Core i5 240GB SSD 8GB RAM link: https://amzn.eu/d/byXAt4b - Dell OptiPlex 9020-SFF, Intel Core i5-4570 3.2GHZ, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD link: https://www.amazon.com/Dell-OptiPlex-9020-SFF-i5-4570-Windows/dp/
 What would I like to do with the new machine? * Docker * UniFi remote + guest portal * Domoticz * Make a small (2TB) NAS. Preferrably with a minimum of 2 disks * Run a Adblocker like pihole * Build up some virtual Linux machines 
 My question is: is this all possible in one of the above options and if so which would be the smartest option?
 I also have been thinking about splitting tasks, with a stand-alone NAS and a thin client, but am very curious about you’re opinions.
 If you have better advices regarding machines, I am also curious for those options!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started this project just to see if my Intel NUC (NUC7i7BN) could replace my larger custom power-hungry NAS. I started with just one drive bay which then quickly evolved into four bays. After a couple months of designing, printing, ordering parts, and testing, this is the final iteration. My goal was to keep the whole server as compact as possible and self-powered, which is why I chose to go with 2.5" drive cages. It's not the biggest capacity At 14TB of raw storage but it's more than plenty for my needs.

 ​
 However, I just stumbled upon the Exos x16 by Seagate (manufacturer recertified) for a whooping 10.62 / TB. Looking at backblaze stats, https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-drive-stats-for-q3-2022/ this is one of the more reliable drives according to their Q3-2022 report. 
 ​
 What am I missing? Should the manufacturer recertified be a red flag?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My storage needs have outgrown my little 4bay nas and im considering a JBOD system with a virtualized truenas. Im really just having trouble with a few things.
  
Enclosure
 Controller card
  
I plan to start with 6x 20TB drives in a raidz2 so id like some room to grow, redundant power supplies are a must and if possible power efficient when drives are in downtime. Thats the only wishlist for the enclosure but theres supermicro,dell,netapp,ect and im on a budget of about 500 for the enclosure
 As for the controller card Preferably not hardware RAID as I wish to pass the raw drives to the VM and allow truenas to handle it but some recommendations on what that card should be would be great.
 And finally my vm server is a dell r710 with a Zotac 1050Ti inside (incase that helps with options.) Rackspace is not a problem

 I asked this question before but I think it phrased it wrong maybe. Hoping this gets more traction.
 I am considering buying a Dell C6400 chassis with 4 Xeon salable blades. One of the particular questions I have is, how loud does this puppy run. I can think with 2 100W+ CPUs per blade it will be quite loud. Has anyone ever heard these go? 
 4 fans to cool 8 100W+ CPUs seems like quite the challenge.

 Came with an Adaptec AHA-2940W/2940UW interface card, but it seems to use some different form of PCI connector than any of my modern boards, where the notch is on the inner side furthest from the outside of the case. It has the external 68 pin connector which goes to the external drive, as well as another 68 pin inside along with a 50 pin scsi connector. I'm not sure what these are for, presumably data is transferred through the PCI part. I'm guessing there is some sort of PCI jumper but I'm not sure what to look for. 
 After that, I have no idea what sort of software to use. I do not expect any sort of automation, meaning I'm sure I'll have to divide my data into 200gb chunks to write as opposed to it being done automatically. I'm on linux mint if that matters, but I guess I could use a windows (98?) VM if need be. 
 Again, I know this is ancient technology but I think it'll be cool to have up and running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Sharing a self-hosted project I’ve been building for awhile: ecowitt2mqtt
 TL;DR: this is a small web server that receives data from Ecowitt weather stations & gateways and sends it to an MQTT broker. This allows for local, near-real-time weather data to be sent to any number of applications via MQTT (including full support for Home Assistant MQTT Discovery). Ecowitt gateways can even be used to receive data from white-labeled weather stations, like those from Ambient Weather.
 It has a lot of great features (including several calculated data points that the weather stations don’t provide natively, like how long various skin types can be in the current sun unprotected before burning).
 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I'm trying to figure out how to best set up my Terramaster T6-423 NAS in terms of speed, noise level and longevity of my larger drives (16TB IronWolfs). I'm thinking of adding a 2TB SSD for the "everyday" processes like the system itself, backups of local machines, torrents (seeding from SSD), Plex server, basically all applications running on the NAS and having all my media and data that I archive and stream on the array with my 16TB IronWolfs. This way that volume can sleep when I don't need it while the processes on the SSD run quietly in the background. I'd run mirrored backups of that single SSD once a day with another older drive or external USB for now.
 What do you think, does this make sense? Happy about any feedback.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm trying to setup an NGINX reverse proxy to my webserver running on an Ubuntu Server 22.04 machine. My internet comes in trough the router I got from my ISP, to which I have connected a separate pfsense firewall and my server is connected to that. Ports 80 and 443 are forwarded on both my ISP router (to the address of the firewall) and the firewall (to the address of my server).
 ​
 I have bought a domain and directed the name to my public ip address using an A record. This works, because I can forward a port (for example 5555) and access it from outside using www.mydomain.com:5555. However, when I try to access just the domain through the NGINX reverse proxy, it doesn't work. When I try to connect to the reverse proxy from inside my network (by just accessing www.mydomain.com) I get sent to the login page of my router. My router doesn't use CGNAT (I think) because when I traceroute my public IP it only takes 1 hop:
 traceroute to my.public.ip (my.public.ip), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 my.public.ip (my.public.ip) 100.108 ms 100.062 ms 100.769 ms 
 My nginx/sites-available/default file looks like this:
 server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; proxy_http_version 1.1; } } 
 I have also added the host in my /etc/hosts file. I found that the second line was already there, where it connected 127.0.1.1 to the hostname of my server (I don't know if that is correct or I should remove it). the file is this:
 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname my.public.ip www.mydomain.com 
 The server I want to connect to my reverse proxy is a nodejs server running on address 127.0.0.1 with port 8000. I have allowed NGINX on my firewall:
 Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- Nginx Full ALLOW Anywhere Nginx Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) 
 Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this?

If I grab it in my hand (disconnected of course from power) and turn it upside down and back ... I can hear something inside. It is like a small part knocking something like a small spring sliding up and down on a bar or similar. It is def. not something just flapping around in the breeze but more like something that has a very limited and "controlled" movement. I don't have this in my WD 8TB Gold neither in my Seagate Exos X20 20TB. Could someone check for me? 
 I have a HC550 18 TB too but it is not with me right now but later I'll check it, probably that would be a "fair" comparision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to figure out the best software setup for my server. It looks like I'm going to run Proxmox, and then a VM for windows 10. I also need Plex on the server and some sort of NAS feature. 
 I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how it all interacts. 
 I have my main laptop which I edit video in using adobe suite. It will connect to the server via 10gbe directly to a dual port 10gbe in the server. 
 The server has a HW raid 10(24TB) that I will store all my videos and photos that I'm not currently editing. I will transfer new content to the server, process it into proxies, and send it to the laptop. This will all be controlled by RDP from the laptop. The server will also be used to render the final files via RDP
 Is this simply accomplished by a proxmox install, and a win10 VM? 
 Is the raid 10 volume accesible to Plex if I run it in a container? 
 Is the raid accessible to win10, Plex, and Nas software simultaneously?
 How does GPU access work if I'm using the server to render, and Plex is using the GPU to transcode?
 Is there a way to get simultaneous access to the GPU for win10 environment and the Plex server?
 Is the HW raid a problem in accomplishing this?
 Sorry for the list but it's actually pretty hard to pin down solid answers on my exact use case, and sometimes one variable being different changes the answers to every other question.
 Thanks for your help.

 I have tried searching online but I usually find posts that involve app issues on truenas. I am running truenas scale bare metal on this server.
 I have replaced the power supplies with different ones, i have reseated the cpu's all the ram and addon cards as well as checked every molex/header connection to ensure nothing is loose, and i've tried disconnecting all the drives and it still happens.
 Nothing in the IPMI logs is showing an error. Need some help here if anyone has any clue as to what I could try to fix it or if it maybe just a bad motherboard. Happy Thanksgiving yall!

I got a used one off of eBay that did not mention if it was vendor locked or not. I am not sure if that is the issue here, there might be an issue with the motherboard, but it is a possibility. The motherboard is an ASRock brand board.
 Does a debug error display on the motherboard? Is there an error beep code? Does the system completely refuse to power on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heimdall v2.5.0 has just dropped, let us know how you get on with it.
  
Release notes: https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall/releases/tag/v2.5.0
 Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall
 Docker: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest
 Discord: https://discord.gg/CCjHKn4
  
Big thanks to https://github.com/keriati for putting in a lot of effort to get things moving again.
 The big changes this release:
  
Updated the underlying framework to Laravel 8, this will be the last version that supports PHP 7.4, v2.6.0 will move to Laravel 9 and require a min of PHP8.0. Just because this version works on PHP7.4 you are still encouraged to use PHP8 instead though
 Updated all the composer and npm dependencies (the latter of which are generally only used in dev)
 Lots of bugs fixed, including one that has been around for 3 years, where cookies would expire and the user would be left with an error 500. Turns out this was an issue when people were running multi-user, it's now finally fixed!
 Some basic keyboard navigation has been added.
 MySQL and PostgreSQL are both now officially supported in addition to SQLite.
 Stop polling when the API returns an error.
 Added a bunch of translations, some of the strings had to be google translated as some were missing though.
 A bunch of fixes have been applied to apps, such as the password field should work properly now.
 There is also a background job that updates old config files if newer ones have been released.
 Private apps and app development has been fixed
 There are instructions for running without external access to the app, however things like automatically downloading icons wont work in that case. This is also experimental, so let us know if we can improve this.
 Doing a tile search will now open the first item in the search results instead of returning an error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After doing some research about power supplies and what to do about powering multiple drives above 10 drives, it seems there is a lot of difference of opinions, experience and or knowledge about what one should do.
 Using Molex molded splitters are a hazard, crimped splitters are safer, however, some comments have had a bad experience with using molex splitting among drives. So then some reddit users recommend different sources for custom cables, yet, when you still get people saying that you should make your own since custom cables are not a good. Then some say not to have but only one splitter for each power supply. 
 I am confused because it seems like doomed if you do and doomed if you don't scenario.

 Now i have a use-case where i need to process the response of one service (get an IP address from the response body) and then check if that IP is reachable on a specific port.
 Does anyone know a slightly more dynamic monitoring system, that lets you do this? Would be great to also have notifications like Uptime Kuma has.

 I used to be able to download videos from Instagram stories by simply Inspecting, finding the video and downloading it. However, they seem to have made an update to how they display videos (both stories and actual posts): Instead of GETing the usual .mp4 video from their servers, they now do it by serving a stream of bytes like so: https://i.imgur.com/H4iAUUF.jpg
 My question is, how can I download these pieces and merge them properly?

 I have right now a 2x (12x 1.2TB 10K RPM SAS RAID-Z2) storage under TrueNAS Scale, it works really well I have no quips about it.
 But I also run a bunch of Docker containers. * Jellyfin * Calibre * 2x Sonarr (TV & Anime) * Radarr * Flexget * Stashapp * 4x qbittorrent instances (over 6k torrents)
 I think storage is becoming a bottleneck.
 So I was thinking of moving all the dockers to a SSD.
 I also have like 16+ VM's that I would like faster performance so is Fusion-IO a good choice or I should go with some other model? (I trust Fusion-IO devices on ESXi 6.x I have a bussiness clients running on them and they have performed flawlessly!) 
 I have been looking at ebay and I think I can get them at a good price 3~TB @ $200ish

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there
 I've been trying out different photo galleries, but none really managed to do what I hope to achieve. For some context, I have a huge library of artworks and content of different artists online (some might call that Linux ISOs). I have everything on my server, but I need a tool to easily view these from a browser.
 Those few photo management solutions that support existing directory structure, all have some kind of downside.
 - Nextcloud photos can't actually use the correct alphanumerical sorting and goes from "1 (1).png" to "1 (10).png" instead of "1 (2).png". The issue for that seems to be stale or just forgotten because it's open for like 3 years -.-
 - PhotoView has some problems with displaying large directories, as it makes giant database queries every time you switch a directory
 - Lychee is quite nice, but its import process is just too slow. With a library of around 300k images and videos, it takes for ever to import that once, but every consecutive one takes forever as well…
 - PiGallery2 is the only one that seems to be fast enough with what experience I want, but still some of the tasks in the background for indexing or general preview generation also takes a long time.
 ​
 Just to clarify, I don't need syncing to my phone or whatever other features solutions like Immich has. I just need something to quickly browse a giant library of photos and videos.
 Are there any solutions I haven't come across, that could help me in this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got all my data in one big 'ol shared folder on my NAS.
 This gets mapped as a network drive to my computer. I am the only user.
 As a result, all folders/files are exposed when the drive is mapped. I consider this an unnecessary risk for the following reasons:
  
99% of my files are archives, and don't need them to be mounted and available 24/7
 The files are irreplaceable
 Ransomware would have access to my entire universe of files
 Fat finger accidents can affect my entire universe of files
  
Before you ask -- yes! I have a solid backup strategy in place. But I still think it makes sense to reduce the surface area for a potential disaster.
 Here are a couple of strategies that I have been kicking around:
  
Create a read-only user account, and use that most of the time
 Create multiple user accounts, one for each high level folder, eg: 
 /Photos --> only allow rw access to 'user1'
 /Videos --> only allow rw access to 'user2'
 /Documents --> only allow rw access to 'user3'
 ...this would contain any potential damage to just one folder
 
  
​
 I am curious if others have a similar approach, or have thought about reducing the surface area to an as-needed basis.

 I read in this reddit post the optimal way to transfer files is
 large sequential writes.If you keep your writes large enough to write an entire track at a time it doesn't need rewriting and you won't get a slow down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a Linux box that runs 3 pairs of 4 TB disks, each pair set to RAID1 with the Linux software RAID (mdadm). I'd like to convert them to a single ZFS pool with 2 parity disks without losing the data in the process, to make it easy to upgrade in the future and to gain extra capacity (would jump from 11 TB to about 15).
 1st question is about the conversion. I'm planning to degrade all three RAID1 arrays to a single disk and use the freed disks to initialize a RAIDz2. I would copy over the files from the first RAID1 array then add the remaining disk of that array to the ZFS pool. Then repeat for the other two arrays.
 Is this doable? It's not clear to me if ZFS will let me start a RAIDz2 with only 3 disks... If I have to start with RAIDz1 can I convert it to RAIDz2 later "live"?
 2nd question is about ZFS portability. What I like about mdadm is that you can install any Linux distro and it will pick up the existing arrays right away, they aren't "tied" in any way to a specific driver or hardware. Is ZFS the same? If I create a pool on one distro and then switch to a completely different one (or dual-boot) will the other one pick up the ZFS pool without a hitch?
 TIA for any insight.

 Beyond the warranty (3yr for red plus, 2yr for shucked), is there a big enough difference in them to warrant one over the other? The red plus cost me $10 more so they are virtually the same price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm taking my first steps into the world on self-hosting with a RP4+OMV (running on a SD card)+SSD for storage.. and so far, I'm loving the experience and the challenge! I'm learning a lot!
 I'm currently running the following services:
  
Plex + Tautulli + Overseerr 
 RFlood + Sonarr + Radarr + Readarr + Prowlarr 
 Nginx Proxy Manager 
 Nextcloud 
 Photoprism
  
The latter of which I suspect is giving me some problems regarding resource usage: my RP4 frequently runs out of RAM and I'd love to know which container is responsible.
 My questions are as follows:
  
Do you think I'm running too many services?
 How do you monitor your containers? I'm considering grafana+prometheus but they look pretty intimidating to set-up.
  
Let me know your thoughts! Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, thanks in advance for any advice. I'm not new to building PCs but don't consider it a hobby, just something I do in order to have a PC.
 I'm building for a new work rig (high end editing/creation), and putting 3x 6TB Ironwolf drives in there for storage of mostly photo and video files along with SSDs for files currently being worked on.
 I don't want to be playing around all day with the RAID setup, I just want something that works and will allow me to recover if one of the drives die. And yes I know that RAID is not backup! The important files are going in the cloud, also it's not critical data to start with (once the jobs are delivered).
 I'm really attracted to the idea of just using windows storage spaces in parity mode, especially now that I found this article and this one shamelessly ripped off the prior article with no credit but does conveniently have the numbers I'd need for my 3 disk setup to run with better speeds, because let's be honest it was NOT easy wrapping my head around the original article.
 Am I right that this is the right solution for a data noob like myself with my 3 disks? What else should I consider that doesn't involve becoming an expert? Things like TrueNas etc just seem like they're way above my paygrade, and I get conflicting information on hardware raid controller PCI cards (e.g. that it would be difficult to recover in case the card itself dies). I understood doing a mobo based raid is suicide.
 Thanks in advance for helping out this n00b!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I need help deploying this docker container in my homeserver. Briefkasten is a self-hosted bookmarking application (Demo). Briefkasten has a lot of nice features that I would like to host in my network but I'm not experienced with building my own docker files. Especially those with a lot of dependencies.
 I'm using Portainer as my container manager and using docker compose files (stacks) in Portainer to keep my docker configs for every container (this helps me with my backups). All of my container images are hosted on DockerHub, which made my life until now easier. 
 I would like to have everything in a stack (a single docker compose file) and I don't want anything to be hosted/running on my server directly. 
 Can you please provide some help on how to build the container and have everything running in docker? I have absolutely no idea how to build a NextAuth.js container and connect a DB..
 ​
 The container's Prerequisites:
  
To self-host this application, you'll need the following thins: 
 - Server / hosting platform for a Next.js application (i.e. Vercel / Netlify) 
 - For OAuth login, a developer account at any one of the providers supported by NextAuth.js 
 - Database that works with Prisma (i.e. MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, etc.) 
 - Image hosting space (i.e. Supabase / ImageKit / Cloudinary) (optional) 
  
​
 Thank you, I appreciate the help!

I had it set up locally initially, until I secured it a bit and then added a subdomain on the host and allowed external access. Everything still works using the external FQDN and I also changed the URL in the env variables in Portainer.
 Trying it from an Android mobile (on the same network) using Opera/Chrome/Kiwi and the frontend loads but says it cannot connect to the backend. By default I still had the local LAN IP configured in the env variables. Changed this to the docker network address and also the external FQDN (after forwarding ports) and they all worked on desktop still but none of them worked on mobile. Changed the address on the error page the frontend loaded and also changed the env options in Portainer.
 I'm not sure what to look at now. As I said at the top, the frontend and backend are talking as it works on the desktop.

I'm thinking getting a bigger case allowing for quieter fans, as well as removing the SAS conversion and using the supplied SATA interface is the way to go. (The trays are missing as well) Any recommendation for a case below $200 with quiet fans? I see a bunch on ebay but not sure if they are any good. Also wondering if the power supply should be kept or replaced with something more efficient. I'm thinking 650 watts is a lot for a NAS. This is a DDR3 server so I'm thinking it's worth saving and using. 
 I've done server builds before using PC parts but this will be my first one using proper server hardware.

(I have found a converter service that backs up Notes to txt files, but that loses formatting and attachments.) I keep the Notes on iCloud for the syncing across devices. 
 Similarly, I'd love to back up my iCloud library of 1000s of epubs and pdfs, ideally with highlights and comments intact.

 I do have a decent amount of experience in Linux and Unix so I think from a software sys admin side I am comfortable. From a hardware side I am significantly less experienced and this is where I would need the majority of help/suggestions.

However I'm concerned regarding how long I should wait before getting a new drive. I've read online that hard drives generally last about 3 - 5 years but I'm not sure what they mean by that. It could mean the drive will become unusable after that period but it could also mean that that's just the time it'll take until bit rot sets in after that period of time passes in cold storage.
 What do you guys think? When should I start thinking about getting a new drive and transferring my files to it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I keep track of everywhere I go. For about a year I kept track of every city or town I went to and recently started cataloguing every park, restaurant or store I go to as well. I use an app called Pin Traveller which so far has been really great and easy but from the looks of the website and app store page it doesn't seem to be regularly active and I have a big fear that the servers will shut down one day and I'll lose all my pins. How can I back up the info somehow? I don't believe the app has any interface for such a thing and I would rather die than manually put down every pin somewhere else. Maybe somebody knows a better app for putting pins on a map that is frequently updated or has a way to back up the data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Newbie from Mexico here. I own a Synology DS413j with 3 Western Digital 6TB drives and one Seagate 3 TB using Synology Hybrid Raid. The problem is that this NAS has a very small CPU, very little RAM, so it is really S-L-O-W. Even when doing a small backup from my PC to the NAS, on a 100Mbps network (not even 1Gbps), the CPU jumps to almost 100%. Also, since it's a "j" (junior) version I can't run docker or anything else in it.
 So, I'm planning to replace it, and I have 2 options (of course, if you have a better one, I'm all ears).
 Option A: A new Synology Model ("+" plus version), with 4 or 5 bays. This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.
 Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. 
 My main usage is:
 a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)
 b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)
 c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)
 d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.
 e) As my own personal "Evernote", with DS Note on android and windows.
 What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? 
 Thanks!

The problem is that I have cgnat. I'm currently using cloudflare tunnels, but they're limited to few protocols and ssh access in terminal requires cloudflared deamon, which is problematic when I can't use my pc or laptop since I can't install it on my phone or school computer. I'd prefer something free or at least cheap. Best option would be having dedicated ports (dedicated IP would be great, but I don't need it and it costs). What are my options?

 so recently I bought a old NAS to finally clean up my external HDD project mess and have a place to backup my photos. But, to be honest, I'm very new to the idea of self-hosting and trying to figure out if this NAS would be suitable to install eg. Nextcloud on it, as it's own web software (Iomega Personal Cloud) is no longer supported and has security vulnerabilities.
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I'm back with another question. I recently got a T610 virtually for free. It has no drives and it's my first proper homelab. I intend to use unRAID.
 It is the 8x2.5" model, and I'm not happy with capacity or speed on 2.5 inch drives.
 I have done some research and want to make sure what I'm thinking will work and be beneficial. I'd like to get an expansion enclosure such as the Dell MD1200. 
 The T610 currently has a 6i raid controller, so I know I need to upgrade it. Should I go with an H200 in IT mode or is there a better option?
 I guess I may be overcomplicating things, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm wanting to do things the best way possible with the T610. I also am sure I'll upgrade in the future.

 Originally, my PC had two SSDs and one HDD all backing up onto an external USB HDD. I was using the Windows "File History" program at the time. 
 While Windows File History was good at saving media files like photos, music, videos, documents, etc... I found that File History was a little finicky when I was trying to get it to back-up all the files on my PC. I tend to play a lot of games on my PC and I like to backup the game files so I don't lose my game progress. Each game tends to save its progress in its own special save-file, usually inside of the "Program Files" folder. Windows …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autocorrect messed up my title. Thanks Autocorrect. 
 So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.
 The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.
 Everything running on Plex.
 So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.
 Obviously I can (and have) "optimized"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?
 Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?
 Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.
 Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.
 Any pointers would be appreciated.

 Next month I’ll visit relatives in another country where things are much more relaxed. I’m thinking about using an old machine as a remote torrent client, connected to my local server’s (running unraid) sonarr and syncthing.
 How do I securely set up remote access? What operating system would be easiest to safely set up? 
 I’ve done some digging on the sub but didn’t find something as beginner friendly as I’d like. 
 Heard about Tailscale but don’t know much about it. 
 It would be great to get some input and be pointed in the right direction.

 I can get a good deal on an HP StoreOnce 5100 G9 LFF server, but I wanted to know if it is locked to running HP's proprietary "StoreOnce" Backup OS, or if It's just a standard LFF DL180 (I'm assuming) Gen 9? I can't really find out too much about StoreOnce systems aside from as ESXI backup servers.
 Ideally, I'd like to run ESXI on it, with the VM datastores being stored on NVME in the PCI-E slots, and passing through the HBA (not the stock HP as it isn't a HBA) connected to the front 12 bays to a TrueNAS VM. Or something like that, maybe I'll try Hyper-V or Linux KVM instead.
 Don't wanna waste my time buying it if it's locked to the proprietary OS.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I'm planning to connect my NAS to my PC through a 10G connection.
 I found some ConnectX 2 QSFP VPI cards for dirt cheap on ebay and am looking for some cheap cables to connect them. I have found several cables declared as QSFP SAS cables. Can I use those to connect the two cards? 
 I also read about SFP cables only being compatible with one manufacturer. The cables I'm looking at are "NetApp X6558-R6".
 I know the ConnectX 2 is quite old now but I can get them for 9€ each while ConnectX 3 cards are still 60€ or more. The specific cards I'm looking at are "IBM Mellanox ConnectX-2 VPI HCA (81Y1533)", will these even work in my case? 
 If the cables I posted won't work, what are some cheap cables I should get?

 I have a Hightower with about 6 unused HDD Slots, should I use those to start with or should I get a dedicated case?
 The data is not overly important and more like: “safe it and get something from it every few weeks or month” 
 Currently I have an WD blue in my system for some years and am very pleased with it, no problem as of today.
 Or should I just commit and use the Red version?
 Any help would be appreciated

I would like to start keeping one of my copies of these archives on an attached JBOD enclosure so that finding files are easier and closer at hand. I generally wont be editing from this archive, and don't need RAID for speed or redundancy. I already have that with my edit dock. If I need to re-edit a project, I can move the files from the JBOD to my RAID overnight. 
 Is there anything out there on sale right now, that is inexpensive usb 3.2 g2 and reliable?

 I am working on building out a couple of servers for my lab. I've been looking at these E52699 v3 procs (18core/36thread). These will be for Proxmox VMs and my truenas setup running a bunch of docker services. The question is... in 2022 (almost 2023), are these procs still worth buying and using for this type of workload, or should I look at spending a bit more on newer processors/motherboards? I found prices for the cpu @ $88 USD, and a supermicro board for $180.
 Thanks!

 How many: Windows hosts, Linux hosts, and other devices do you have running in your lab?
 My friend told me 50 would be the upper limit, but I disagree. 50 might be higher than the average, but someone out there will probably have more. 
 For myself: 5 physical Windows servers, 5 devices (router, switch, managed power, temperature probes), 1 VMWare server (NUC), two Linux VMs, 4 Windows VMs (each Windows VM hosts 250 IP addresses!) 
 So 17 'things' in the lab, but over 1000 IPs :)

 I got this old pc for free it was going in the trash. It’s a 4 core 4 thread i5-3470, 256gb hard drive, 8gb of ram. I ordered 36gb of crucial ram, 18TB seagate IronWolf Pro NAS hard drive, and a 500 GB ssd. Newegg has some pretty good Black Friday deals. Got the ram for 60 bucks, hard drive for 300, SSD for 26 dollars. My plan is to use the hard drive and 3 cores as a plex server and NAS. Then 1 core and the SSD for a Minecraft server for the kids. So far I’m having a blast with this home lab stuff it’s a lot of fun setting up Proxmox and everything.

 I had one storage server for home use, but now i am adding two more and I want to add a load balancer in front of them so i just have to connect via SFTP to one address and the LB should automatically return the actual server with the least amount occupied disk space. Instead me manually checking ok which server had the least amount of disk space everytime i want to add something, or maybe cluster them somehow so they all appear as one device? 
 I was thinking like proxy server with a python script that queries my 3 storage server's disk util but I am not sure if that's do able? i use file zilla and opnsense fw. 
 my design is not very clear right now just wondering how others would approach this issue.

I would like to route everything except for the WebUI traffic through wireguard (which sits in a docker container. I'm using jordanpotter/wireguard). Unfortunately pretty much every docker wireguard setup tutorial that I've come across suggests using the wireguard container's network stack by applying network_mode: "service:vpn" to the relevant containers, and then using ports: - "127.0.0.1:8080:8888" to expose the WebUI ports to the host, and the reverse proxy picks it up from that point. I would like to avoid unnecessarily exposing ports to the host, however, if possible. Others suggest setting up wireguard on the host but I'd rather have everything in docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at the MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN as a cheap way to add 10Gb connectivity to a couple pieces of my homelab, mostly NAS and workstation, but there are a couple things I'm unclear on.
  
Can the 1Gb RJ45 port be used as the uplink to the rest of the network? Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.
 Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.
 How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.
 Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE? I'm wondering how much headroom it has in terms of power for the transceivers, either optical or RJ45 copper.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, this thread gained a lot of traction in r/DataHoarder:
 PSA: Verbatim no longer sells real M Discs, now puts regular BD-Rs in M Disc packaging
 c't-Magazin followed up on this and spoke to Verbatim:
  
Auf Anfrage stellte Verbatim jedoch klar, dass es sich bei diesen Medien um Weiterentwicklungen handele. Die technischen Änderungen führten zu einem anderen Aussehen und der Fähigkeit für höhere Brenngeschwindigkeiten, die veränderte Medien-ID sei auf eine Anpassung an andere Verbatim-Produkte zurückzuführen. Die ersten veränderten Medien hat Verbatim bereits Anfang 2022 ausgeliefert. Die Datensicherheit der neuen Scheiben steht jener der alten Scheiben nicht nach: Daten sollen nach Angaben des Herstellers ebenfalls 1000 Jahre halten.
  
Translation:
  
Verbatim clarified that these discs were advancements. The technical changes resulted in a different appearance and the ability for higher burning speeds, the changed media-ID was due to an adaptation with regard to other Verbatim products. Verbatim had already shipped the first modified media in early 2022. The data security of the new discs is not inferior to that of the old discs: Data should also last 1000 years, according to the manufacturer.
  
We will update you, should there be any new developments in this story.

 ​
 Just set up a new homelab, with a couple of servers running TrueNAS, apps like PhotoPrism etc. Also new switch (MikroTik CRS312-4C+8XG-RM).
 I'd like to be able to resolve hosts with a FQDN instead of I.P. address, so for example photos.homenetwork.io rather than 192.168.1.8. What is advised ways of doing this for mere mortals, such as hosting a virtualised private domain server service that's easy to use with intuitive UI? 
 ​
 You will note I'm no networking expert (!), so thanks for any guidance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, it’s Eldad from the Appwrite team 👋
 I’m happy to share that we just released Appwrite 1.1 with a fully redesigned console for Appwrite, the almost full open-source alternative for Firebase. Since the very beginning, the goal of Appwrite has been to create a new type of backend development experience. One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.
 The new Appwrite Console in v1.1
 Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.
 To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.
 In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:
 🖥️ Dashboard
 🔐 Authentication
 💽 Databases
 🪣 Storage
 ⚡ Functions
 🧙 New Wizards
 ... and more!
 Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.
 We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI. We’ll continue to evolve our developer experience, and we’d love your feedback.

 Currently I'm using Intel NUC8i5BEH with Ubuntu 18.04 as my home server (Plex, *arrs, wireguard etc.) and bought another old NUC where I installed Proxmox to get a bit familiar with the hypervisor. 
 I'm looking to build my first Home Server with NAS that will be:
 1. Small - preferably Mini-ITX, but I'm open to small cases that can fit Micro-ATX boards.
 2. Power efficient - I pay $0.55 per kWH :/ 
 As I plan to install TrueNAS VM within Proxmox I thought about the following:
 1. ASRock Z690M-ITX/ax LGA 1700 Intel Z690
 2. LSI 9211-8i to connect drives to and use PCI-E passthrough
 3. 3 x 8TB WD Red Plus 7200 RPM 3.5"
 4. WD BLACK SN750 NVMe SSD 512GB (from another machine that I'm getting rid off)

 Now, I also have a k8s cluster with a Traefik ingress controller that I want to use to expose some services on a different domain.
 My idea was to use the first instance of Traefik that is open to the web, and route all traffic for the second domain to the second reverse proxy managed in kubernetes.
 I can't really think of a better way to do this, besides doing all the routing through the k8s ingress, but that's something I'm trying to avoid.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link to imgur album of room
 I recently had a 4'x10' room added to my house. The room is accessible from inside the house and has an thru-wall fan exhausting into the garage. It doesn't have any dedicated cooling.
 I used double louvered doors with a 1/2" gap at the bottom, hoping this would allow air to be pulled in from the rest of the house.
 The fan on the back wall is a AC Infinity AIRFRAME T7-N exhausting into the garage.
 The rest of the house is usually kept around 70F. The server room stays around 80F in front of the rack and 90F behind the rack. At one point, I tried creating a hot/cold aisle with foam board, but I only noticed a 1-2 degree difference at best. 
 In the original design, I intended to put shelving on the walls of the server room and use it for bulk food storage/pantry, but I'd need the temperature to be closer to <70F for that. What could I do to lower the temperature of the room? I've considered cutting a hole in the wall for a window AC unit (exhausting into the garage), but I'd prefer to cool with airflow from the rest of the house if possible. Do I need a bigger exhaust fan?
 And finally, the rack contents (from bottom up) for anyone curious:
  
2x APC 3000s on dedicated circuits
 Custom build TrueNAS in Rosewill chassis
 Dell R210ii running pfSense
 Dell R620 unused
 2x Dell R630s running ESXi
 4U drawer
 2x Cisco 3750x switches

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current hardware / setup:
  
I own my own domain with Cloudflare as my DNS provider
 Unifi UDM SE with no ports open, upnp off, and wireguard (Teleport) to VPN when I'm away from home.
 Synology NAS with quickconnect turned off
 All services are running on the same LAN network (sans IoT devices)
 Nginx Reverse Proxy to internally point to my services by subdomain
 Pi hole as my LAN DNS with router firewall rules to prevent any other DNS servers from being allowed.
 All services are spun up via individual Docker containers hosted on my Synology.
  
I'm thinking about doing two things in the near future.
  
I'd like to share files from my NAS with friends with the link coming from my domain
 I'd like to stand up a basic web service and expose it publicly over port 80/443 when someone visits my domain
  
I have some ideas on how to be safe about this, but would love all of your suggestions!
  
Connect internal and external services to my NPM container and use Access Lists to control which services are externally reachable (via IP range allowlisting). Point ports 80/443 to my NPM.
 
Spin up two NPM containers. One for internal services, one for external. Create a VLAN and put my external NPM + external services on that VLAN. Port forward 80/443 to my external NPM. Add firewall rules so traffic can't escape this VLAN. This might make sharing NAS files externally difficult (unless I put it on my external VLAN?).
 
For just sharing NAS files (ignoring website hosting) turn on Quickconnect and create a CNAME on my domain to map drive.mydomain.com -> quickconnect.mydomain.synology.me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi homelab.
 I scored a free 12 U server cabinet the other day, but it's looking a bit sad with the current setup. Right now there is a 6 year old HP laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz and 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD. I only use this to run plex server with radarr, sonarr, qbt and Jackett.
 I want to expand with a rack-mounted server but I'm a bit overwhelmed with the options and price differences. I want something that can run ESXi with VMs for my plex media environment, as well as plenty of RAM and local storage options for NAS capability and practicing with virtual machines. 
 Low power consumption and noise are nice-to-haves, but right now I just want something to muck about with in my homelab, but with some solid functionality over the network. My budget is up to $400AUD, and I don't mind it being DDR3 as it's more affordable. 
 Can anyone point my in the right direction of brands/models/cpu configs I should be looking at for my needs?

 ​
 Just a quick question for today, so as of recently I have found myself with the need for some high clock speed cpu's in the datacenter lab for a project before i pull the trigger on some new hardware for my business, at the moment i am just using a couple of dell 7060SFF machines in the home lab but these will be too big ang bulky for the datacenter as i pay per ru, i stumbled across the r340 and the E-2288G in my testing on some rented dedicated servers but have been struggling to find the E-2288G for sale anywhere which made me think, its basically an I7 6700k, so can i use a 6700k in the R340 or a similar server ? 
 TLDR; will an i7 work in a dell server with the same socket ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been on this sub for a long time and have seen some really cool stuff on here and a lot of good advice so I'm looking for some of my own please.
 I have just bought a OptiPlex 7040 Mini/Micro to replace my old ass laptop that handles my plex server (All storage is done on a 12TB 2 bay NAS).
 The relevant specs of the OptiPlex are i5-6500T, 8gb ram (I'm pretty sure ill double the ram just to be safe)
 What OS do you think I should run on my new setup? I'm currently running windows but think I should convert to Linux or maybe proxmox with a Linux boot for plex or maybe even Linux with docker for plex not sure yet, Tell me what you think.
 I'm also looking for any other suggestions for software to run. Have been thinking of hosting some game servers for a while now, Minecraft etc.
 I'm in my second year of computer science so I'm not afraid of a challenge

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I want to setup an instance of Dendrite, a matrix home server. I have a docker-compose set, the yaml file in the correct directory, but I do not understand how to generate the key files. the dockerhub states that I should use this:
 go run github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/cmd/generate-keys \ --private-key=matrix_key.pem \ --tls-cert=server.crt \ --tls-key=server.key 
 But I have no idea how to use these commands. I am running dietpi on an OptiPlex and using docker-compose to avoid baremetal installs. Any help would greatly be appreciated.

 I posted this in the /r/sysadmin subreddit and was told this would probably be better to post here. I’ve been trying to research UPS systems for a little while now, but there were a couple of things I couldn’t find much information on. I was hoping maybe somebody might be able to help me out?
 I’m setting up a system in my house for my wife and me to use for gaming as well as video editing using Windows. I’m planning on putting together a Synology NAS system to be used as both a media center for Plex or Jellyfin as well as a storage space for the videos we’ll be editing. While researching NAS systems, UPS’s started coming up and I’ve been thinking it'd be a great idea to incorporate either one or two into my setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering what the best way to edit video metadata is. My current method works just fine but it's SOOOOO slow and I'm looking for a better method. Currently I've got a bunch of .mp4 files with data written to the Title and/or Comment fields that I want to replace. I mostly just want to put my movie title in and nothing in the comments field. The name of the file is in Plex format "%Title% (%Year%)". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.
 My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im using google translator and I hope you have a little patience, thank you <3
 A little context:
 I'm looking for some object hosting (S3) and among several alternatives and recommendations on the internet, I saw someone commenting on the combination of Cloudflare R2 and OVH
 I don't understand a lot about it, I'm at the beginning of studies about it but after reading superficially, some ideas came to my mind
 OVH Object Storage does not charge for "outgoing internal traffic"
 I read on the internet that this is like sending from one server to another, different from, for example, providing a link or GET operation for that file externally/publicly
 Researching about Cloudflare R2, I understood that it does not charge for external/public output of objects and is compatible with S3
 I searched a bit on the internet and couldn't find the answer. 
 Direct question:
 Is it possible for me to use this OVH "outgoing internal traffic" (that is not charged) to send the files to another server like Cloudflare R2 and from R2 make it available in my application, so I don't need to pay OVH transfer fees?

 I just want to know where I can find information about what I'm doing and what products exist and which ones are the best.
 Also as a random aside what do you guys use as offline storage? BD-Rs seem to be extremely expensive right now and I'd love a really cheap way to archive stuff like old youtube videos I love, DRM-Free games I have, and Minecraft saves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening and thanks for reading, 
 This is my first post here but I have been an occasional lurker for a while now and was wondering if anyone can steer me in the right direction to some resources or general information. I am looking to create a home media server that might be capable of some other things like ad blocking or running a VPN (I'm interested in exploring containerization later as well). With the equipment I have already where would I be best suited to look for instructions on how to go about accomplishing my goals and is there a better way of doing it? 
 Equipment thus far:
 - RaspberryPi 4B with 2GB in a starter kit (with power supply)[I wanted to try to make a Pi cluster]. https://www.pishop.ca/product/raspberry-pi-4b-starter-kit/
 - refurbished Lenovo ThinkCentre M73 Tiny Desktop (Intel G3250T 2.8GHz,128GB SSD, 8GB, WIFI)
 - Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Plus Switch
 I also have 2 older (from 2009 & 2013) MacBook pros I have been slowly upgrading [batteries, memory, RAM where possible] in the hopes of using them to be my media servers but I am having issues sourcing some parts.
 I do have some experience with virtual machines (VM Ware) and Ubuntu/Linux) if that helps.
 Any information would be greatly appreciated, thanks again for reading.
 ​
 tl;dr: Point me (beginner) in the direction of information on how to build a home media server with the equipment I have or suggest some additional equipment.

 I am looking to start learning Kubernetes on my homelab and am looking to see if there are any good guides that people would recommend. I know there are a lot of them on the web but want to see if there are favorites among this community. 
 My goal with this is two get a 3-node cluster (2 workers, one control) up and running and then deploying a pod or two within the cluster. I know there are things like rancher and so forth, but before I dive deeper, I want to have the basics mastered.
 Thank you!

 Any suggestions?

I've been meaning to make some upgrades to my desktop PC, and I'm currently struggling to find a very large internal drive, around 8-10 TB+, meant for standard/consumer desktops. Mostly everything I can find for a good deal right now is meant for NAS systems or enterprises, which have technologies that aren't recommended for a desktop, as compared to something like a Seagate Barracuda. Things like trade-off differences in speed and latency, error recovery, etc.
 I plan to store lots of large files, like lossless images and audio, movies, books, and maybe programs - all things I read and write regularly. My computer sees 15+ hours of use each day. I would also rather get one large drive than multiple smaller ones.
 One that I saw that seems like a great deal is the Toshiba X300 10TB CMR SATA 6 GB/s 7200 RPM 256 MB Cache - HDWR11AXZSTA for $189.99.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

 Right now i use thunderbird and add the mailboxes to each user(4 users with 5 mailboxes).
 Are there any tools where i can add multiple mail accounts and add users which then i can give access to them?
 Would be nice if the programm runs on a shared hosting like 1and1 because i don't have access to a root server.
 For the features i only need adding users, give access to one or multiple mailboxes, add signature, rules/automations like in outlook/outlook web would be nice., don't need any fancy ticketing system(but wouldn't be bad either)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit, this is a progress update post for Memories, a FOSS high performance alternative to Google Photos that you can host. Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.
 For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.
 40k photos in one view
 Progress update as of 11/22/2022
 tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.
 Some of the major new features:
 Live Photo Support
  
Thanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.
 HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.
  
Video Transcoding
  
Memories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.
 Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1
  
Multiple Timeline Folders
  
For maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.
 You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)
  
Server side encryption
  
If you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore
  
New metadata sidebar
  
You can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar
  
New photo viewer
  
With some fancy UX. Try it out ;)
  
The full changelog can be found here.
 If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone!
 So about a week ago I presented MonoBox here - a self-hosted music player I built 🎶
 And then a few days ago I published an article I wrote - a piece describing the entire process I went through, the difficulties I encountered, and how I learned everything from scratch to build MonoBox. All of this in order to help other people who are also learning programming and might be struggling 👨‍💻
 For a reason that is still unclear to me, the post was deleted. In the short time it was on the air, it received many upvotes, there were many sympathetic responses and it seems that the purpose for which I wrote the articles was achieved and helped many people. 😊
 I'm attaching the article once more in the hopes that more people will be able to read them and share their opinions, as it would be a shame for me if this opportunity were lost and those who didn't have time to read would miss it.
 And of course don't forget to star the repo! ⭐

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found myself scrolling through Github’s “trending” repos. Within the next hour, I stumbled across something called The Sherlock Project. Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.
 I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.
 I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.
 The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.
 Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!
 Whats next? Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think :)

I have a 300 square foot storage room filled with IT junk. I have about 40 Dell 7010 USSF pcs. I have a pile of about 20 Cisco poe switches next to me right now... I would LOVE to share, but r/homelabsales requires Paypal, which is a hard "No" for me. (And has been for a VERY long time.) I even tried to message the admins of homelabsales for options, and got no response. So, does anyone have any suggestions on how I can share some of my bounty, and get the wife to stop yelling at me about the amount of "crap" I have in the house? (Other than ebay... It is too much like a job, and I got one of those...)

 only other option is if there is a way to pull an OS off one nimble to install on another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So just to start I do not need a launcher that is not the problem I'm trying to solve, I've seen other people ask about this sort of thing in the past and it seems people tend to misinterpret "organizer" as launcher. The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.
 I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.
 Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.
 At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?

 ​
 I want to download all the pdfs from this website (https://www.supersummary.com/all-study-guides/) that will be available to me as soon as I pay for my monthly subscription.
 EDIT: 
 I want to access each of those books on the following 500+ pages
 ​
 After accessing the book the download pdf shall be executed and the pdf stored
 Edit over
 I tried HTtracker but it does not seem to work for me. Is it the right tool and I am just not using it properly? I have the feeling that it is not opening all the guides and does not try to download the pdfs but instead just downloads every link it can find without going into every link and checking again.
 ​
 Do you think Wget will get the job done? If so, how would I have to use it?
 ​
 Thanks in advance and sorry for my english.

 and I say that, because transcend to my surprise said that 220S (MTE220S) is losing warranty if it poweredon constantly.
 The NVMes (3 of them, in 3 computers) started having issues accessing data! and lost data in all. Because they all died in 1 month of constant 24x7 power on.
 The total TBW was 1TB out of 2.2PB 
 I am surprised with all this. and I want to use 3 NVMes. I expect 200TBW in 5 years so that is not a prob.
 I want not to lose my warranty because they are just powered on! 
 ​
 They will be installed on 3 NUCs
 I can give more info on Transcend's replies! never had this before in my life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.
 Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.
 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.
  
Huginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.
  
Hosting: Self-hosted.
  
automatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.
  
Hosting: Self-hosted (for now).
  
n8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.
  
Hosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.
  
Beehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).
  
Hosting: Self-hosted.
  
Power Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.
  
Hosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).
 ---
 I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what I'm asking is alot but I feel like what I'm asking should be a very common request for anyone doing basic YouTube archiving of descriptions and comments.
 I'm looking for something like:
 Root folder having the yt-dlp exe then in same directory folders created with the YouTube channel name
 YouTube channel name > Folder with name as the video title > mp4, description as txt, comments
 Repeat folder generation for each video on the YouTube channel
 Edit: It seems this post is getting alot of attention from people wanting to do exactly this. After a couple hours I figured it out:
 yt-dlp --get-comments --print-to-file "%(comments)#j" "%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s 
 From my understanding this will do everything you need along with populating a json file that contains info like keywords on the video, upload date etc. You can open it in Firefox. If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:
 yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file "%(comments)#j" "%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s

 There he is!
 I had forgotten about this site: https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/peer/ , but if you didn't know about it, it shows what torrent files were observed from a specific IP address. The link displays your IP by default, and could show if your firewall rules need a closer look because 'someone' on your LAN needed an ISO... but you can browse and see what your "IP neighbors" were up to, which is entertaining :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I just purchased a use Optiplex to replace the laptop I had some services on. In the past, I've installed software by hand, but this time wanted to focus on Docker.
 I followed the tutorial by highspeed_usaf and got SWAG and Cloudflare's tunnel working. I added NextCloud, Portainer, SearxNG, and Doku. Everything is working fine and SSL is working too even though, I'm not sure I really set it up (using SSL via CloudFlare).
 Anyway, NextCloud's security check is giving me a lot of warnings. Before, when I installed NC by hand, I was able to get rid of all the warnings and such. However, because I'm running NC via Docker, I'm not quite sure what to do. 
 I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'm still not sure what the process is when I get such errors. Do I change files within the container itself? Or is there a better way to do this?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I ordered a SuperChassis 505-203B and an X10SDV-4C-TLN2F motherboard.
 On Supermicro's site for the motherboard, it lists the compatible chassis as:
 505-203B and 504-203B.
 Funny enough, both of these "supported" chassis only have a 20-pin power connector.
 Can I safely use the 20-pin in the 24-pin header?
 I was doing some brief research and it looks like those pins are only for "extra protection," but I don't want to risk anything burning, shorting out, etc.
 Supermicro support told me that the 20-pin connector has the necessary pins and should work no problem, but I just want to be as safe as possible.
 ​
 Here are the specs for the PSU:
 1U 200W Multi-output power supply Gold level w/20pin Power Efficiency 91% Total Output Power and Input 200W with Input 100 - 240Vac AC Input Frequency 50-60Hz Dimensions (L x W x H) 192 x 76 x 40.3 mm Output Type 20pin ATX -12V Max: 0.5A / Min: 0A +12V Max: 16A / Min: 0.1A (100Vac - 240Vac) +5V Max: 8A / Min: 0.1A +3.3V Max: 8A / Min: 0.1A +5Vsb Max: 2A / Min: 0A Certification: 80 Plus Gold Certified Power Supply Safety / EMC BSMI CCC CE/EMC FCC class B TUV/CB UL/CUL 
 Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

 I have configured Grafana and Prometheus. They are pretty pog for long term stats and visualisation. But I just can't find a quick and easy way to configure Grafana so that it sends me a daily report of some metrics. I saw there is an enterprise feature similar to that.
 So, my question is, what do you guys do? Is there any quick and dirty way to set up daily reporting of metrics? Are there any containers that can do those for me? For now, I would prefer the process to be as hands off as possible. Please leave me your suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My gf and I both have iphones and she moved into my place. We were looking to create a back-up of photos we take to a 2TB hard drive on my windows PC. From searching on here, many recommend the PhotoSync app but I'm wondering if having 2 iphones syncing to the same computer hard drive will overwrite some of the files since I believe the file names by default on iPhones are IMG_xxxx and that prefix or the naming convention can't be changed (or can it?)
 We don't take much videos but good amount of pictures as we go on short trips every weekend. And we would like to have all of them stored not on some cloud.
 Just looking for a simple way to back-up photos that we take. Any suggestions are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So seeing how a ton of us are running CPUs from the pre-discovery of Spectre and Meltdown era on our servers, and that's still where the price to performance sweet spot is on the used market, what does that mean security wise? Has it been mitigated if you're running the latest version of Linux for example? 
 What about hyperthreading/SMT? It feels like yesterday where everyone was freaking out that hyperthreading got busted wide open and the only way to be safe is to completely disable it (particularly on Intel CPUs). Gas that been mitigated or is it still a bad idea to run hyperthreading on older CPUs?
 It feels like everyone was freaking out that the sky was falling after Spectre and Meltdown was discovered, how we've been plunged back into the age where just loading the wrong webpage can get your online banking info stolen, and then abruptly stopped talking about it a few months later. So what's the state of older processors today?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys... 
 Anyone here run a drivepool + snapRAID?
 I've been running stablebit drivepool on my NAS for almost a decade now. Great piece of windows software. I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.
 Here are my questions:
  
I'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?
 
Also, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.
 
lastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?
 
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Saturday there was a early Black Friday deal on Amazon for 16TB WD MyBooks.
 Since I had good experience with them in the past, I bought 3 to shuck them.
 ​
 They arrived today and I happily connected them to seemingly hear the tones of death.
 The sounds are very strong after spin up.
 During sequential write there is no sound but during rand read write it sounds like the heads are scraping the disks very lightly.
 ​
 I will do a full write/read test to see how they do but since all 3 of them make the same sounds I wonder if they are actually dead.
 ​
 Technical Data: 
 Smart reports them as WD160EDGZ-11B2DA0 which with a bit of google magic are white label Ultrastar DC HC550 7200RPM 512MB Cache 16TB SATA Datacenter Drives
 ​
 Tests via USB
 FIO SEQ WRITE [w=183MiB/s][w=183 IOPS]
 FIO RAND READ WRITE [r=87.0MiB/s,w=15.0MiB/s][r=87,w=15 IOPS]
 All 3 make the same sounds. 
 ​
 Sounds:
 Took me over a hour to convert it, so reddit accepts it and I don't get any sound...
 In case it does not work I uploaded the sounds here: https://filetransfer.io/data-package/1ncFUb2A#link ( 779KB )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up free three servers from my old college’s e-waste bin. It appears they were custom built from Canadian company for audio production.
 All of them are using iStarUSA D-300 3U rackmount chassis with C2D setup with some special audio capture and ASUS GeForce 8400 GS Fanless cards. I decided remove all existing hardware components in the servers because their motherboard and PSU are dead due to leaked capacitors. I gave away one of them to my friend.
 Then, I installed two servers chassis with old and. new hardwares I have:
  
 Chinese X99 board with Xeon E5-2640 v3, 32GB DDR4 ECC REG, and 12TB (4x3TB SAS HDD) RAID setup. It is currently running Unraid.
  Supermicro X79 dual socket board with two Xeon E5-2620 v2, 64GB DRR3 ECC REG, and 500GB SSD SATA. It is currently running Proxmox.
  
Now, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?
 P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.
 P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports. I will post photo of setup in comment this tonight.)

 I figure I can beat this cost, I already have a Netgear LM1200 but now I have to find an appropriate data plan. I am a T-Mobile customer right now, so I'm going to check out what they can offer, but I'm curious to see what others use.

 I know people with friends/family in Ukraine. They want to preserve their accounts but don't do well with technology. I did download a few accounts through instaloader but IG keeps temp banning my IP. This is a pain because I keep needing to verify my account and wait hours before doing it again.
 Is there a website that lets you download all pictures on an account? I know there are sites that show you Instagram posts but none offer bulk download options. :/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m totally stumped by this one. I figure if anywhere has experience with this kind of thing, it’s probably this sub. The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. 
 So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). 
 Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. 
 So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. 
 What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time 
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I used to run a simple windows server while exposing my services using port forwarding and mostly neglecting security. Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.
 I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).
 I have the following setup:
  
Cloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.
 
Nginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.
 
OpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.
 
 I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.
 Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.

 I cant seem to find any info if what I'm trying to do is possible.
 I want to run a matrix server without the session verification feature, only on an internal network, perhaps with a federation to one other trusted server. Even the encryption feature is not neccesary.
 The users are frequently going to login on different devices and I all this verification fuss is driving me mad. 
 Is there any way to achieve this??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an existing paperless-ngx docker setup holding about 2.500 documents (or approx 5.000-7.000 pages).
 Need to move the entire existing db and files to a new docker running on another host. Unfortunately some files using German Umlauts (like ä, ö, ü oder ß).
 I tried to tar, scp and zip the files but the special characters are not handled correctly. My Google-Fu pointed me to some solutions to change the files to ASCII naming - however as these are referenced within the db this could cause issues.
 What is the correct way of moving files with UTF from one host to another?

 im thinking of a way to back up my system automatically every day incrementally and ive come across dulicati, which looks great to backup filesystems.
 however, Im thinking attaching an external harddriver and creating a snapshot of my entire system to this drive will be much simpler and more effective in case of a whole system crash, wouldn't it? 
 what are you using to back up your systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently aquired a FiiO M11 player, which is pretty nice.
 So I got to thinking about music syching.
 Currently I've explored the following options:
 MusicBee on my Windows laptop with the MusicBee Android companion for WiFi sync. Works quite well, but requires my Windows laptop to be up.
 Resilio Sync, pointed to a folder on my network storage, with the app on the Android side pointed to a folder on the external SD card. Can sync files by dropping them into the storage on the network and remove from player by removing them from the folder on the storage. Would prefer to be using Syncthing, but that's unable to write to an external SD card.
 I have a Plexpass and Plexamp works well. However, as I quite like the default player on the Fiio, I'd like to use that too (Plexamp downloads are not in a format readable by other apps)
 What I'd really like would be able to browse a list of artists/albums/track from the player and select them to sync down.
 Are there any options anyone's aware of that I've not yet explored? Can Subsonic clients download in a format readable by other apps for example?
 Curious as to what others may be using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 ​
 So, request from my miss: a shared grocery list AND a shared calendar. On the same app. Go find it.
 ​
 Now, let me further explain that: as you may have understood may lovely half would like an Android app (if possible, but further on this later) which hosts both a shared grocery / to-do list along a shared calendar.
 ​
 I've already found a pre-existing app (Cozi Family on the playstore) which does exactly this, but I'd prefer a self-hosted solution because... reasons (and to justify the expense to upgrade the current homelab I'm running :D )
 Jokes aside, I'm already aware of multiple selfhosted solutions (Grocy, our-shopping-list, Nextcloud, etc.) but to my knowledge those are doing a single thing each (maybe it could be done with nextcloud, but for this scope is a bit overkill) but I'm looking for a single solution, and as mentioned, it should have an Android app (possibly) but it's not mandatory, if it's a webapp I could work with that.
 ​
 Any chance something similar already exists?
 ​
 Thanks!
 ​
 EDIT: after posting, I've taken a further look and found a multitude of similar apps, but they have the same """problem""": they aren't selfhosted.
 So if possible, keep this as a suggestion for selfhosted solutions and not altervatives.

 I am trying to get a bearing on how much resources I'll need to host it, I am anticipating approx 800 users, maximum maybe 300 will try to access it simultaneously, so how much ram, CPU and storage area would anyone recommend? How many users do you have and how much resources do you use? And is it comfortable or would you increase it? Should I go for shared hosting, will it be enough, or is it necessary to get a VPS?
 TLDR: for 800 users, 300 access simultaneously, how much ram, storage space and CPU cores do I need? Should I go for shared hosting (Namecheap) or is it necessary to get a VPS?
 Thank you everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody, I see alot of people using Tailscale here as you should as it's an efficient tool for cross-device acces. However I also see some people be a little bit bummed out by the lack of devices on the free plan. Well fear not as tailscale has a plan which is made for open-source projects to use, and also for friend/family use. The Github Community Plan.
 This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. 
 Step 1: Create a github account
 Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)
 Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.
 Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with "Select Network" as it should be under the "Multi-user tailnet" banner.
 Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the "Github Community Plan".
 Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. 
 Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi, i've been self-hosting stuff for a couple years now (freshrss, radarr, etc.) and have never had any reason to use port-forwarding, ddns, or tunneling to make my services available outside of my local network. for this reason, i skip authentication where i can, but i'm not a networking person, so sometimes i wonder if my setup is vulnerable. i'm not sure exaclty how uPnP works or if I should add firewall rules. 
 basically, if i never touch port forwarding, is there any reason my services would be exposed to the open internet? apart from using open port checkers on my own IP, how can i check for vulnerabilities? thanks! love this community btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm a not experienced user and this would be my first build. So if you don't mind I have a couple of probably simple questions.
 My goal: to run a couple of simple dockers application and then the occasional Plex/Jellyfish and file storage.
 I'd like to have something that uses around 15 watts per hour, anyway the consumption can be a little bit more.
 In terms of memory I'd like to connect: 1 SSD and two 18 TB 3.5 hard drives.
 I found a pc with those specs:
 -Itx Intel J1900 2,00 Ghz Quad Core -ASRock Q1900B-ITX - 16 GB ram 
 I went on the Asrock website and it says that the motherboard has:
  
1 x PCI Express 2.0 x1 Slot
 2 x SATA2 3.0 Gb/s Connectors, support NCQ, AHCI and Hot Plug
  
Now questions are: - Can I use the pci express slot to add more SATA ports? - Would the 2X 3.0 Gb ports allow me to connect 3.5 hard drives? - it is enough speed to satisfy my needs?
 Pardon me if the questions are too simple or obvious, and thanks in advance!

 I currently have firefox set up to search with my SearXNG instance. Let's say my server goes down. Then I can no longer search through the URL bar. I instead have to go to searx.org or something and type my query there.
 I would need a browser extension that periodically pings my services to check if they're up, and if they're not, automatically set up a redirect so that when I go to their URL, I get sent somewhere else instead.
 Does something like this exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious about the potential of cloud hosting. I had a server running hosting Siacoin with 29tb of redundant HDD via Raidz-1. However, the returns were next to nothing so I looked into other solutions and I found nextcloud. Through that I have a few options and was wondering what the community believes would be the best course of action.
  
Rent out storage on a central server and offer that to users via WHMCS and Nextcloud module.
 Offer users their own nextcloud server through VPS and use wireguard tunneling/reverse proxys to provide each VPS its own ip/domain and use an automated script to download and setup nextcloud.
  
Which option do you think I should choose? Currently I am leaning to option one because it would be simpler and continues with my business plan to expand into my own software, create mirrored servers for redundancy etc...
 Edit: I am also worried about potential liability concerns regarding data loss. What can I do to negate liability in a document form. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very pleased with cloudflare tunnels, it feels much less scary to publish each of my services at servicename.domain.ext because:
  
I don't have to port-forward
 I don't have to have something watching my dynamic IP address
 Most importantly, I can set security rules, like limiting access to my country, and more
  
It's against the ToS to use these for media streaming (on the free plan). I'd like to stay free but also serve media, without drastically reducing my security. You guys can tell me if this is unreasonable 😄
 What's the next logical step?
 All my services have their own username/password, some have 2FA, but I'm interested in OAuth. Does it make sense to use a cloudflare tunnel for the authentication of say, a Jellyfin server, but once logged in, just use a direct connection? How would one go about that? Looking into Caddy 2/Traefik but I'm not sure if I'm overlooking any big flaws.
 Or, if I want some services (say, Tandoor recipes) to be under Cloudflare's protection, but others (Jellyfin) using a 'direct' connection, is it possible to achieve both of those on the same domain name (under different subdomain)?

I haven't done something like this and am confused where to start but I like the idea of self hosting and avoiding as many monthly fees as possible. Is it a good idea to have the database on the company laptop, and pay for the site to be hosted? Are there any security concerns with that? Are there security concerns with also hosting the web server on the laptop if only 2 or 3 people will be using it? Or do I have to worry about random bots or trolls connecting to the address.
 I'd be happy with suggestions to a good starting point too

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am trying to build my server infrastructure completely with WSL2 and Docker-Compose. It should contain networking, backups, various services (Nextcloud, Gitea, postgresql...) and those services will be accessed from LAN only. Some services can have internet access for making requests into internet (Node-RED for example).
 I see there could be issues, especially with backups and disks. I am thinking to host a Kopia container which i use to backup data to another drive. Another question i have is related to disk health, S.M.A.R.T monitoring - Is there any solution for getting information about disks with WSL2? I see Scrutiny as an ideal solution but I think it's not for WSL2.
 I'd like to hear experiences about WSL2 if it has been successful solution, what are caveats, is virtual machine better etc.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Long time lurker here! Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. 
 I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. 
 The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. 
 My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. 
 After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. 
 I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. 
 Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?
 Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. 
 If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. 
 My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. 
 Thanks!

But since the drive is going to mostly be used for storage, the main thing I care about is the longevity. So which one do you think would last more as a storage device?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Similar questions have been asked a few times already. I don't really need fancy graphs or anything nice to look at. Just a tool that notifies me (e.g. using a WebHook, Telegram, ..) if a disk/mountpoint is almost full. It would be nice if it's possible to also get a notification if a systemd service fails or define custom shell commands but that's not as important. Prometheus and all these databases seem like overkill. It should be as lightweight as possible (RAM usage, disk usage, dependencies).
 If such a thing does not exist yet, let me know if you'd be interested. I might create such a tool if no one comes up with something. If you think such a tool doesn't make sense without time-series data (and graphs) let me know why you think so please.
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been using Unraid for years now. I have a lot of docker containers and NPM set up and running with a cloudflare tunnel and my own domain. I come across a lot of programs that I'd like to try out on a 2nd server so I don't mess anything up on my primary server. I don't want mass texts about plex being down. So I just spun up a 2nd server running proxmox and an ubuntu server vm. I installed docker, docker compose, and I'd like to kind of mirror my original unraid setup and get everything proxied through NPM, but I'm having a hard time getting it set up with the same domain. 
 When I try to go through the cloudflare tunnel setup it says I already have mydomain.net with a DNS record. Is it possible to have 2 instances of NPM on 2 different machines using the same domain and cloudflare tunnels or do I need to get a 2nd domain? I'm not sure how to describe this situation to search for a guide for it. Any help would be appreciated.

 I do not want to host the docker on my NAS, as I turn my NAS off when I'm not using it, and raspberry pis are now hundreds of dollars. 
 Does anybody think I'd have issues running a cheap, used micro PC (like a Dell 7050 or similar) with probably Ubuntu server to host this minimal web server? Not sure if the dashboard would require docker, but I assume since docker can run on a pi it could run on something more. 
 I'm not looking to host a file serverz or Plex, or anything else other than this web interface. Potentially if the docker turns out easy, I might migrate my piHole and diyhue from their respective pis, but not sure on that one yet.

 WireGuard works when everything is in a single compose file by adding the following for each service:

 However, when services are in different compose files, they can no longer see WireGuard and show this error:

Is there a better solution where I can back up my iPhone wirelessly or automatically to an external hard drive? What hard drive would you recommend to do this?

 I've been scouring the internet and racking my head to solve this for a few hours and finallyd decided to post this.
 My current setup is a RPi 4 running 64 bit Ubuntu with docker running pihole and freshrss. I can access the web interfaces for these two services on my WiFi network on any device currently. 
 My end goal is to be able to access these services over the internet (without having to be on the same network) on my custom domain, which is registered on Njalla.
 Currently from all my internet troubleshooting what I've gathered is I need to add DNS records to my Njalla domain, do port forwarding on my router and run an nginx reverse proxy?
 What I can't seem to find is a good guide to do this. I went into my router settings and did the port forwarding from ports 80-10000 for a test for both TCP/UDP mapped to the RPi, but when I check online using port checkers, it is still closed. How do I verify these things are working? And how do I configure nginx here?
 Any guides or explanations would be super appreciated! Absolutely lost here.

 I plan on using the eight 3.5" bays for storage pools, one SATA port will connect to the OS SSD (ProxMox, TrueNAS & pfSense) and the other SATA port will connect to the VM SSD.
 If I purchased this box, do I need an HBA card? Or could I simply get two SFF-8643 to SFF-8087 cables to connect the backplane directly to the board and disable the onboard raid controller? 
 Or, is there something I'm not taking into consideration here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been self-hosting for a while, but for the first time, setting up an always-on server.
 Many previous posts on this sub have suggested Proxmox for a first server. However, based on my requirements, I was leaning towards Truenas Scale Bluefin. I need it to host some reliable storage for Postgres and fileshares, provision VMs to throw at my (external) K3s cluster for burstability, and lastly, host dev VMs for builds and VNC. I dont need vm snapshots, or hardware passthrough.
 The other thing is I also want to learn for career development, and TrueNAS familiarity seems to be a more useful skill since Proxmox isn't used in enterprise at all- looks even less likely as K8s seems to be the future of enterprise.
 Wondering with these requirements, does TrueNAS Scale over Proxmox make sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey I live in Canada and winter coming I recently put my “server room” into a room in my house that isn’t well insulated and as we speak the ambient temp inside that room according to a dell power edge r620 sensor is 15degrees Celsius currently and I was wondering what is to cold for condensation to occur. The inside server temp are around 35-41C and I’m afraid that if that room goes any cooler condensation will occur and break part. So my question should I find other solution to heat up that room or move completely out of there (I was told if there a constant air flow this will not occur wonder what people opinion are on this) current plan is trying to warm up the room
 Edit: I have two sever and all my networking gear all in the same place as the dell sever stack one on top of the other with spacer in between and networking gear wall mounted
 Closed: I was not aware to the fact the the computer would need to be lower them temp room for condensation to occur

 Im working on building an offline home surveillance system. Haven't settled on an OS or software situation yet, so Im purely asking about hardware. 
 I cobbled together a server out of spare parts. Its an i7-4770s, H97 mobo, 32GB ram, gtx 750ti, 20TB storage (for redundancy). 
 Do you think these parts would work for a 4-8 camera system? Id love to keep it mega cheap so if I can rock these parts for a while thatd be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on increasing security in my lab. I currently have 3 VLANS setup:
  
Management - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc
 Home - My personal devices
 Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services
  
My firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).
 I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.
 This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.
 Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?
 ​
 Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN? No right?

 The summary says to consider replacing both disks. This is weird to me, how is it possible that both completely new drives (bought from Amazon) are failing?
 Is this normal for drives to come with some amount of bad sectors or should I immediately return them?

 support full-text search, or at least search by tags;
 have a user management system (rights/groups/etc.);
 support a review process for new files/materials;
 either have a sleek GUI or integrate with a popular CMS like Joomla;
 [optional] ideally, give users the ability to provide feedback on individual materials;
 [optional] ideally, have a free/community version (open source greatly preferred).
  
Great thanks in advance!

I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.
 A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.
 The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.
 Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.
 Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. 
 And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.
 PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment I have a server, it's an ITX build with 3x 14TB drives, and room in the case for another 3. Software wise it's a ZFS array under Linux.
 The system runs off an M.2 drive so we don't have to worry about that, but it's only got 4 SATA ports leaving me too short. The PCI-E 16x slot is unpopulated and I have no plans to put ever put a graphics in there, it's running terminal-only.
 Seems like I've got a few options:
  
Buy one of those super cheap PCI-E SATA cards.
 Buy a second hand SAS card (I know almost nothing about them, seems overkill for 2 drives?)
 SATA -> USB adapters? (plz no, but also theres enough unused USB headers on the motherboard to do this if it's actually not a bad idea)
  
Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, figured I'd share my home lab, providing all necessary services to my familly. I don't know if I'd really call it LabPorn but hey...
 From top to bottom:
 -2x cat6 patch panels to keep things "tidy" in the front
 -1x USW48 Pro for all my 1Gb switching needs
 -1x Mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ for iSCSI + backups
 -1x old Supermicro 1U server I got used with a Xeon E3-1220 V2 and 32Gb of ram that runs my opensense box (I really don't like virtualized firewalls, too risky)
 -1x QNAP TS453-BU NAS with 2 Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 2x IronWolf 8TB for backups
 -1x QNAP TS1886-XU NAS with 4x Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 4x Exos 18TB for storage
 -2x Dell R630 I got for free at work running a proxmox Cluster with plenty of power for all my virtual machines
 -1x Proxmox server for some Flux nodes
 -1x Truenas box as a 3rd backup target with 28TB of storage + 4 IBM SAS SSDs over iSCSI for my VMs
 -1x unused server
 -1x little APC UPS
 About 700W of power usage. Yes I like to have several iSCSI targets for virtual machines so I can move them around whenever the underlying server needs to get updated. That Mikrotik switch has been a great 10Gb switch for the price.
 I run a whole bunch of services on there, from basic storage, to active directory, exchange, the usual sonarr, radarr, prowlarr stack, paperless, netboot.xyz, some homebrew websites like a lego set inventory and investment tracker, openhab, docker, plex, gameyfin etc....
 It's located where our old heating fuel tank used to be. I pretty happy with the state of my lab for the moment tho I really need to take time (I don't have) to do some real nice cable management.
 The next major project is going to be to redo the room itself with a raised floor, drywall on all wall and ceiling etc. cause it's really just barebone and ugleh!

 I have a TrueNAS server running with a RAID-Z3 configuration and recently upgraded my entire server HDDs. Now I plan to sell the old used drives but before that I want to erase them securely. 
 This brings me to my question - what is the best tool to securely erase all my drives? Is a single format of my drives (for example Windows quick format) enough to format my disks since they were in a RAID or is it safer to use a tool explicitly designed for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a new computer and I plan on using the old one as a NAS server. I currently have a 4 TB and an new 8 TB ironwolf drive, which as far as i understand can't put them in a raid (i mean i can do raid 0 which would give me 4TB usable). 
 Is it a better idea to return the 8 TB drive and buy 3 4TB to run TrueNAS with 4x4TB drives?
 I have an mATX MB which has 4 sata slots 2x 6Gb/s and 2x 3Gb/s, should i buy a an hba sas and buy one of those sas to 4 sata splitters? Since i will be needing at least 1 more slot for the boot ssd. And do you have any recommendation for the hba?
 Should i even go with TrueNAS or should i go with Unraid (i read that they have a sw raid where you can have different size disks in it)
 I'm fairly new to this so any help is much appriciated :D.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What if we all from r/selfhosted come together to make our own community based globally distributed software? Like a giant cdn but provided my individuals who are willing to share their bandwidth (with limitations) or host FOSS software like searxng across all the nodes so it will never go down. It might be hard but can we do this? I can acquire a lot of IPv6 ips and we could try to boost IPv6 in a small way. We could use anycast as load balancing
 EDIT1: I get the legal implications with a cdn. So it is a hard choice. We could disable video or sharing or large files. But we can easily run Foss software for people who can't maintain that software to be up 24/7 or people who can't. It can be a centralized place for a decentralised network. One place with load balanced network or mirrors for the same

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've got several HGST Ultrastar HUSMM1616ASS200/HUSMM1616ASS204 that I bought as a bundle. I thought they were identical (except for the minor difference in encryption bits (the 4 vs 0), which I don't care about). 
 However, they fall into two groups:
  
EMC Branding: These show up on my computer as "HGST" disks, with the HGST part number HUSMM1616ASS200.
 HP Branding: These show up with the HP model number M01600JEFPC.
  
Question: How do I get the latest version of the HP and HGST firmware and the tool to flash it on to these drives? My understanding is that trying to flash regular HGST firmware onto HP OEM drives or vice versa would be an ... unwise ... idea.
 I should note that they're all working (even though the power lights don't stay lit on the HP drives when they're in my Supermicro backplane), but I'm aware that the latest firmware can optimize power usage/data integrity/etc.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the question is simply: will this cheap nuc work for a <10 person minecraft server and/or farming simulator quality games.
 amazon nuc in question 
 So my wife and I like to play games with our friends that usually involves her paying for a dedicated server. She is the one that typically handles it so I am a little in the dark about things.
 I have a very vague idea of what would be needed for a home server, but I could be way off the mark. 
 With Christmas coming up I wanted to get her something to mess with when it comes to having her own home server for just our friend group. We spoke lightly on the subject of just getting a home server. The interest is there, the knowledge is lacking, so having kind of a cheap starter setup seems like a decent enough way to go. 
 As for games, we would most likely have mod Minecraft, V Rising, Farming simulator, terraria, ect.
 We would typically have less than 10 people at any time, and the interests of the group swaps almost monthly in a rotation of games. So probably wouldn't need to be running multiple servers at once, but just have the ability to switch between them. 
 Thanks in advance for helping a well intentioned oblivious husband.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm wanting to setup Exchange Server in my home lab (Specifically 2019 but even just 2013 or 2016 will work) with the full shebang, configuring MX records, what ports to forward, making it so I can actually use it as an email server on the Internet and I'll be honest, all the posts I've seen on Google are either hard to follow (Many have broken images or just don't have them at all) or don't cover everything you would need to setup to make it work, some only cover installing it on Windows and stop there and others just try and coax you to use 365. But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.
 I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.
 What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.
 MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/
 Many thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got to the point now where the number of both hardware and software is at the point where monitoring health/status/logs needs to be centralized.
 Some of my hardware has options for remote log servers, or provide public/private SNMP traps.
 Some OS have the ability to forward logs.While some software have APIs/XML/SOAP for polling statuses.
 An overview of Docker and kubernetes running/error/IO/general usage would also be handy.
 I've been looking at a few results from google but my experience so far has left more questions than answers.
 Also some of the prices are focused on SMB / enterprise licencing and not suitable for homelabs. I'm really focused on community projects or opensource where possible.
 ​
 ​
 Question: What's everyone using for centralized logging ?
 ​
 What I'm hoping to do / hoping for :
  
I'd really like to find a way to access and log my switches' SNMP trap info about port status and monitor traffic stats, port disconnects or high traffic alerts would be amazing
 I don't want to install an 'agent' or application in each VM or docker where possible.
 The output should have a webUI if possible
 Options for IPMI would be cool for the management cards on the bare metal servers (most if not all of mine have telnet or ssh options)
 I don't need to monitor windows based machines
 Log retention options would be nice (day/week/month)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I want to take advantage of this Black Friday to build my own jellyfine server and need your help in choosing hardware.
 ​
 My priorities are:
  
Playback of 4K HDR x264 & x265 .mkv files.
 Use as little power as possible
  
​ 
My use case:
  
4K TV with Amazon FireTV 4K
 Full HD TV with DLAN or Chrome Cast via smartphone.
  
​ 
Hardware I was thinking of:
  
Intel NUC 11 Pro Kit BNUC11TNKI30002
 2x Crucial P2 SSD 2TB M.2 2280 PCIe 3.0 x4
 1x Crucial RAM CT16G4SFD824A 16GB DDR4 2400MHz CL17
  
​ 
I am open to any suggestion. Thanks in advance

 So I look for something like a selfhosted option to create tours for websites. Does anyone know something like that?

 I recreated all my containers through stacks in Portainer (previously did that in Synology docker GUI). I have typical containers like qBittorrent, Emby, Netdata (don't use arr's for my needs).
 I wanted to organize a nice interactive dashboard but it fails to pass the connection test, both in Organizr and Heimdall so I end up with static dashboard and information that it fails to connect (to be precise cURL error 28: timeout after 5000 ms).
 Somebody at Organizr discord suggested this: ' I would think more something with the way syno does it's routing for docker... it might be worth switching your containers over to compose (or at least a custom network) where you can use docker dns to do the inter app communication' and pointed to follow this guide:
 https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Synology/
 I tried to do the testing for a coulpe of hours but it was beyond me, so I recreated all of containers through stacks in Portainer, still no dice.
 Could someone point me what to try next?

 I'm building my first home server and wanted to build something power efficient but that could also do anything I threw at it for quite a while. The two CPU's I've been looking at are the 12700k and the 12700t. My thought process was to buy the 12700t but the performance seems to be on par with an i5. I then thought to buy the 12700k and undervolt it to be as power efficient as the 12700t. Which route should I take and can the 12700k be as power efficient on idle as the 12700t? I have found both for the same price.

 Actually i dont have a reverse proxy configured, yet - this will be the next step. I am trying to access the docker-host / container directly.
 I also tried it with start-dev mode, but hat the same result.

 I bought SFF-8087 to sata breakout cables, and it booted, showing no disks attached.. Disks didn't spin up.
 I learnt that SFF-8087 OCR (aka reverse aka crossover?) is what I need, so I bought those.. These to be exact: https://www.inline-info.com/en/products/cable/sas/5540/inline-sas-cable-mini-sas-sff8087-to-4x-sata-direct-ocr-0.75m

 What second-hand hardware should I be looking at for lab use? Thinking Cisco MDS if I can, but don't know what to really look for. Also don't know what SAN tech I should look for that won't murder my wallet in the second-hand market.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Internet. So, I managed to break my SSD today. As I was connecting it to a SATA-Cable the whole (plastic) SATA Connector just bent over. After unscrewing, I noticed that some of the connectors to the PCB of the Sata Connector were loose. In an effort to safe the thing by resoldering the pins, one broke. So I just desoldered the entire thing. Now I was wondering, is there any hope left for my drive? Could a skilled solderer just solder on a new connecter. It’s not really about the data, I just don’t want to buy a new drive :)
 Thanks for any help/advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering putting a row of HDD cages on a 1u tray and zip-tie them down. Each cage would have a 120mm fan. Example of cage: HDD Cage
 I would then have an HBA from my NAS go to each drive. Alternatively, I may mount a backplane/cage (but I can't figure out how to cool these appropriately).
 Will the drives being open-air help or hurt airflow? My instinct is that it would help, but I wonder if the exposure will prevent air from flowing in the direction I want.
 How would y'all power these? Should I tie down a PSU in the middle of the same tray? Is there a non-PSU alternative that would be cheaper? A PSU is capable of so much that it seems wasteful to only power hard drives.
 And most importantly - is this stupid / am I crazy? Are there things I haven't considered? Should I just get a rack mount case and be done with it? I'm having trouble finding what I need in a case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have received 3 x WD Elements 18tb drives. This gives me enough space to consolidate my data on lots of smaller drives into a single server and get rid of either my 2014 Unraid build or Synology DS918+. I am thinking I will keep the Unraid, but ready to be convinced otherwise.
 Unraid: 8 Drive Fractal Design Define R4 Case, Gigabyte H61MA-D3V, i3-2120, 8gb ram
 DS918+: No mods, holds 4 drives.
 I've tried a few transfers of different folders to both NAS units this evening. The Unraid seems to be about 5-10% faster. I'm more confident using the DS918+ and day-to-day that tends to be the device I use more frequently, but I figure the DS918+ is now end-of-life and the stats suggest I'm getting marginally better performance from the Unraid, not to mention future value.
 Is this a no-brainer? Or should I consider keeping the DS918+?
 My total data is only about 25tb, so the 3 x 18tb drives will be sufficient; leaving a spare bay even in the synology.
 Grateful for thoughts. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 We are a movie theatre that receives *ALOT* of electronically sent films. 
 These come in on a variety of different services and I've been tasked at coming up with some sort of automated solution to handle off this traffic. 
 We currently have an 30TB Unraid server that's near full, but the plan was to build another server, probably TrueNas with 60TB+ as the main rig with the Unraid server doing midnight backups. Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. 
 Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. 
 Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. 
 Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. 
 Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table.

I found it with the plastic of the cover to the left of the USB port bent out and slightly broken but not melted i think a firefighter may of stepped on it. There is a very slight smell of soot but no visual smoke damage and the hard drive it’s self seems fine. No rattling sounds either. I think it is also very possible that it may of gotten wet from the hoses but this was about 3 months ago so dry now. If i plug it in to retrieve data am i risking damaging it? Should i give it to a specialist before attempting this? Thank you for any answers!

 I recently got a Minisforum MINI-S, so I've been setting it up to be my main server. My current shortlist is as follows:
  
Traefik as the proxy
 Nextcloud for files and maybe photos
 Immich for photos if not Nextcloud
 Syncthing (already installed) for smaller file shares accessible anywhere
 tailscale (already installed) for remote access
 Timeshift for backup to disk.
 Homeassistant
 Emacs server for access over ssh
 misc small services like discord bots.
  
Anything I've missed? 
 My main restrictions are that I'm behind a CGNAT and the hardware itself.
 The hardware is:
  
CPU: Intel(R) Celeron(R) N5095 @ 2.00GHz
 RAM: 8Gb DDR4
 Storage: 128 Gb M.2 SATA SSD + 1Tb Extenal HDD
  
Currently I also have a raspberry Pi3B dedicated to being my filtered DNS/DHCP, and soon-to-be-deprecated Syncthing 'server'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I started setting up mailcow a while ago, and while everything worked fine (in terms of sending and recieving mails) SSL didn't work.
 On the left my blog (for school), and on the right mailcow's webmail client
 I have both of the above sites reverse proxied using NPM with the same SSL cert. I have even put the same SSL cert in the ssl folder of mailcow.
 ​
 So my question is, how is it possible that both sites have the same SSL cert but different subjects and how can I get mailcow UI to have the right subject. 
 ​
 FYI the cert is from CloudFlare's Origin Server tab, but the same happens with the Client SSL/TLS certs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally got PhotoPrism up and running and have run into a couple of issues that are kind of annoying but seem to be limitations of the platform. I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. 
 First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as "animal" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. 
 Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members "user level" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. 
 I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.
 It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server. Obviously, that would have its own pitfalls, but it's just a thought.

 I was wondering what your favorite services or containers are for productivity, quality of life, web indexing etc.
 I’m not that interested in things like plex, torrenting and stuff like that. But services like Uptime Kuma, changedetection, Pihole, Home assistent and Homebridge really make my life easier in both professional and personal ways. I was wondering if you guys have anything running that I’m not yet aware of!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[first off.... the code + demo:
 Repository - includes a GIF demo 
 What is AmbientWeather?
 AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.
 ​
 What does your tool do?
 Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. 
 If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.
 ​
 Which weather stations are supported?
 Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.
 ​
 What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?
 What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.
 ​
 Anything else?
 So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups. If you give this tool a try and hit any issues, please be patient and feel free to open an Issue or post on the Discussion board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a USB3 dual disk dock and have two spare 4TB drives left over that I thought I would put in there and have Windows use them as RAID1, BUT I noticed. USB disks cannot be converted to dynamic disk and hence, not possible to do the ”ADD MIRROR”. What is the best way to be able to achieve this? My idea is that if one disk fails, it just keeps working with the one disk and I can replace that and the mirror will rebuild. And the idea was to use software raid so I could read the disk on any system.
 I also have a Linkstation that I could put those disks into, but I would prefer to not be bound to the hardware.
 I read about windows storage spaces also, but from what I read, it seems it would not simply keep working if one disk fails like I was planning?
 If nothing else, I would just have to use them both individually and setup my robocopy to just copy to both of them…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I'm using a Pi 4 as a media server and currently using mergerFS to pool multiple drives which works great. I also have a 10TB parity drive and a cron job to do nightly syncs to the parity drive. The issue is the parity drive is nearly full. I just added a 5TB drive as a second parity drive but was looking for a way to pool it in the same way I'm pooling the main drives with mergerFS.
 I'm not currently using SnapRaid but was considering installing/configuring it, but can't quite tell if that will accomplish what I need. Or, is it possible to just use mergerFS and add a second line in /etc/fstab to pool the two parity drives? Then, I would change the cron job to sync to the mergerFS virtual parity drive. 
 Any advice is greatly appreciated!

 I'm stuck and can't figure out what's wrong. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or solutions I could try. I have a PiHole and PiVPN set up. PiVPN is using Wireguard and is set to use the PiHole as DNS. 
 When I connect a wireguard client, I see the client's DNS requests on the PiHole admin panel. For example, oauth.reddit.com shows up as a fulfilled DNS request from a .pivpn client. However, the client never displays the web page. `wg show` and the Wireguard phone app show that packets are being transferred between the VPN host and client, but the data volume is very small. 
 Has anyone seen this behavior before? Is there anything I should try? I have Fios.
 Thanks!

 I'm using Univention Corporate Server as a directory service for my user administration (several family members).
 Nextcloud, Bookstack, Tandoor, Proxmox etc all successfully authenticate against the UCS-LDAP. Only Calibre-Web won't work?
 I followed this guide, but when I try to sync my users, I always get the following error:
 https://preview.redd.it/r21bxt0tuw0a1.jpg?width=575&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09c6bc905ea14b18236e1853c77f85436bec77d0
 My settings for importing the users are as follows:
 https://preview.redd.it/mcjwg8qtuw0a1.jpg?width=983&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6f6dfd86cbecd5dcf8d2c218c5bd61f04b58d1f5
 Calibre-Web manages to connect to UCS, but can't find any users to import. All users who should have access to Calibre are members of the group "App-Calibre" (same structuce, e.g. "App-Nextcloud" for access to Nextcloud works just fine).
 Can you help me to find my mistake in the settings?
 Best regards,

 Hi guys, I'm starting with selfhosting and started thinking "ok, I have a bunch of ports, how to serve this?"
 I started with nginx and setting one url for each container I have, like http://domain/app. This proved to be a pain to setup, since some problems (static files like bla.js being loading as http://domain/bla.js instead of http://domain/app/bla.js for example) and etc. Then I changed everything to http://app.domain since it is way easier to setup.
 And you guys, what pattern do you use for your links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using rclone for years on my Linux server. I have a script I wrote that backed up data, logged in, and sent pretty HTML emails with status.
 For complicated reasons, I am getting rid of my Linux server and moving everything to my daily driver Windows 10 machine.
 I don't have time or patience to write a new script. I know I can use my old Linux script using WSL or something but I'm hoping for something more native to Windows.
 I was looking at alternatives to rclone that are easier to use on Windows like GoodSync but, honestly, when I do research, everyone says they all have issues and rclone is the best (it is).
 I don't want to re-create the wheel. I feel like this is a common problem that someone must have solved.
 If not, I feel like there is a huge opportunity here for someone to wrap a pretty basic GUI around rclone for Windows. Something that'll let you create scheduled tasks with features like email notifications and what not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I've been using Mubi to keep track of movies I've watched for the past 10 years through their "favourites" feature. At some point I think they introduced "lists" and only included this and reviews on their app. I just logged on to find they removed favourites entirely, so my collection is just gone. I emailed support about it and they just said they removed it because it was redundant and not on the app... the whole situation is just dumb. And with no warning.
 So is there any possible way to see it again? It's not on WayBack and I already tried Google cache, I can see the collection on my profile but can't click/access it. I also tried it with the direct link but it didn't work. It was quite personal to me, if anyone has any suggestions it would be super appreciated. (I'm on Mac btw)

 However when trying to connect outside of my home network i cant access it, after som troubleshooting I remembered that the raspberry pi is running a vpn and that is probably why i cannot access it from outside the network.
 ​
 Is there anyway i can go around this or is the only option to disable the vpn or get another server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So about 4 years ago, I was looking for a solution to get 2 ethernet ports back to my brother's room using an existing coax with the device being remotely powered. What I came up with was taking 2 DirecTV DECA adapters, I took an antronix power inserter and used it to deinsert power so I could split it to the two DECA devices, but I found out that there are no existing splitters on the market that power pass on more than one point simultaneously so I had to make my own DC splitter by taking an old crappy splitter prying the glued back off and cutting out the magnet wire and ferrites and soldered a piece of copper wire between all the ports. Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible. I only really ever used the device for testing, I never got around to installing it as I intended and then I went back to Comcast and the coax was no longer dead so it sat in a box until I found it today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright. I have an old PowerEdge R610. 
 For various reasons, I want to have a big RAIDed-together drive for media storage, and a separate drive for system files etc. I would prefer these are actually physically separate drives. 
 I have 3x2tb HDDs and 1x500gb SDD. I want to raid the HDDs together, and install to the SDD.
 How do I make the SDD show up at the same time as the RAID? I slot the drive in with SDD in slot 0, HDDs in slots 1,2,3, set up a RAID, go to install ubuntu serve... and the SDD doesn't show up. I've been banging my head into this wall for a couple days now. What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been recovering from chemo and mostly lounging in bed for a few months. Today is the first day I've felt well enough to spend time in the home office. So what did I do? I cleaned up my desk and then pulled each of my ESXi hosts from my lab and configured Intel vPro and AMT and put them back. 
 vPro/AMT was one of the things I was looking for when I upgraded my lab last year and replaced all my Dell Precision hosts with these Lenovo Tiny pc's. 
 I am amazed at how well this works, no more disassembling my rack when I need bios access. And MeshCommander runs on my mac, so no need to boot up a windows VM either to manage this stuff. 
 Is anyone else using vPro/AMT in their homelab? I know a lot of folks run iLo or similar on their commercial grade servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 I was told by someone I should download to D first and then transfer in order to not make the WD too busy.
 But I don’t have much space in D, so if I do this it may be a little annoying to download little portions and then transfer. And if I do so, I don’t know if it’s good whether I keep my WD constantly connected or disconnect and reconnect it several times.
 On the other hand, I can just download directly to the WD. I just wonder if it’s safe for it, as I’ve heard the small ones which are not SSD are very sensitive and vulnerable.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I've been struggling with this for a bit and was hoping someone could shed a light on the issue for me.
 I have an external server pointed to example.com with the intention to eventually reverse-ssh a connection to my internal Nextcloud instance at nextcloud.example.com.
 I also host a dnsmasq server in order to make nextcloud.example.com point to the internal IP when I'm on the internal network instead of the external IP.
 To be clear, currently only example.com should point to the external server IP and nextcloud.example.com should point to the internal server IP.
 This works fine for a short amount of time after I connect to the network, and then suddenly it's reading the Cloudflare record instead and says it can't find nextcloud.example.com. I can disconnect from wifi and reconnect and it works fine for 10-20 minutes and then starts having the same problem.
 Even though I have my client configured to use my dnsmasq server only (which then forwards requests it doesn't know to an external server,) it still inevitably ends up looking to Cloudflare instead of dnsmasq.
 I'm so confused as to why it would work for a bit and then just stop, especially since I'm telling my client to only talk to dnsmasq in this instance. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

I picked up what seems like good cable (Monoprice Cat6A Plus, 10G, 650MHz, UTP, Solid, Riser-Rated (CMR) 23AWG) and have been having a very difficult time terminating it into male ends (punch-block keystones are fine of course).
 I tried two sized of connectors ("trueCABLE Cat6A Extra Large RJ45 Pass Through" and "trueCABLE Cat6/6A RJ45 Pass Through Connectors") paired with two types of crimp tools ("trueCABLE All-In-One Crimp and Termination Tool, Compatible with Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6A Ethernet RJ45 Connectors" and a Klein tools variation).
 I am stripping well, careful in placement and crimping fully. Still, I get continuity failures on most pins. Am I jsut not applying enough force, or have I chosen fundamentally incompatible connectors? 
 Any hints welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: which domain registrar would you recommend besides GoDaddy or Google Domains?
 I've heard the horror stories about GoDaddy before. They're arguably one of the most recognizable names in domain registration/websites etc. I didn't have any problems with them; until I did. I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night trying to sort out an issue that should be simple. The person on the phone was obviously following their support script and I don't blame them for that, but how many times do we need to re-create the issue before you escalate it? I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say "2SV", is not well implemented in their system.
 For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. 
 So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).

 BeatLog parses and processes NGINX and fail2ban log data into a PostgreSQL database, so you can then assess your server traffic to your heart's (get it?) desire. Here is the data structure for the logs.
 I use SWAG for my reverse proxy, but it should be compatible with any common log format -- so not Caddy, and maybe Traefik depending on settings. You can also add locations to all the data using the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 Some other features I'm proud of and use:
  
Characterize IP addresses as "Home" or "Outside", based on server's current public IP address.
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren't found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names

 So I'm wondering if anyone is aware of something that meets the following:
 - Rackmount (I can deal with anything up to 4U, reasonably).
 - Narrow depth.
 - Enough space for 4x3.5" drives.
 - Provisions for at least ONE PCI-e card.
 I'm willing to build from a case up, or an all-in-one solution. The server will run Linux and does not require much processing power at all.
 Is anyone aware of a product/case/anything that I can reasonably get off-the-shelf that will fit these needs?

 After buying the DS920+ from Synology last month to replace my good old 10 or 11-year-old Thecus N2200 with 2x 1 TB, the time has come to buy the drives.
 At the moment, I have inside the DS920+, 3x 2 TB units + 1 TB unit.
 My idea in buying the NAS, is to have an easy place where to put my family photos, back up from the phones to the NAS automatically (ditching google photos), use a surveillance station with 2x cameras and the extra space is for building a media library.
 I thought to buy 2 big units, shuck them, and put them inside the NAS in SHR RAID type; at the same time, put one 1 TB drive plus one 2 TB drive that came out of the NAS, inside the cases where the big drives came, connect them to RaspPIs with Rsync, one at my home other at brother-in-law, to automatically back up the family photos folder which I don't want to lose.
 ​
 After looking at disk prices .com I found the 2 best deals at Amazon DE are the 18 TB Western Digital Elements units at €16.06/TB (€289) and the second-best deal is the WD My Book 16 TB at €16.5/TB (€264). 
 After reading around some older threads in the sub, I see some fellow hoarders point out the fact My Book has hardware encryption, making it not desirable to shuck and put it in the NAS. My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?
 My second question is, what drives are normally in?
 I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. 
 In your opinion, is this achieveable?
 Are there any deals I should look into? 
 What would you buy nowadays?

 Newbie here seeking for advice. I recently got a DL380 Gen9 from Ebay to start my homelab. After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.
 Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!
  
The server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?
 The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?
 The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'd like to set up a white box NAS that has some high-capacity HDDs with two mirrored 1TB or 2TB SSDs for additional fast storage. The goal with those is to keep the HDDs from spinning up every time the pool is accessed (for both a power and a noise perspective). I'd like for it to automatically shuffle data around periodically based on usage (i.e. most-used data stored on the SSDs).
 Is there anything that supports this? (Ideally with a nice GUI - nothing in Linux ever seems to "just work" from the command-line) I've messed around with TrueNAS in the past, but it doesn't seem like it can do any of what I'm mentioning (it cannot let the HDDs go to sleep (or something along those lines), cannot shuffle data around based on usage, and you can only use SSDs as a "cache" where the data is offloaded to the HDDs instead of having mirrored SSDs that actually store information).
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to configure NPM to play nicely with Nextcloud, and I've run into a bit of an issue. When I add the line "proxy_http_version 1.1;" to my config, the proxy goes offline with the error "'proxy_http_version' directive is duplicate in /data/nginx/proxy_host/14.conf:60", but as far as I can tell that file doesn't exist. Whether I browse the filesystem through the host OS or open a shell inside the container and navigate to that folder, there is no 14.conf file. Any idea what could be happening here?
 Edit: I don't actually need this line to work to fix the issue I was having with Nextcloud, I just want to understand what is happening here
 Edit 2: Two additional notes
 - The host OS is Unraid
 - The /data directory doesn't actually exist, it redirects to /config. Not sure what to call that, and also not sure if that's related or not

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I was going to get two large 12-16 TB drives and put them into RAID 1, but after thinking about it is putting five or six 4 TB drives in RAID 5/6 a dumb idea for a beginner? The dollar/GB ratio is better and in case of a drive failure it's much cheaper to fix at $80-ish bucks a drive vs $220, but that is a lot more moving parts and probably over double the power in drives. I'm gonna be using it for ripping and hosting the family's DVD collection, my Blurays, PS2 games, and some important file backups. I'll be using a retired 4670k and 16gb of ram as the base for the system.
 Actually, thinking about it now would it just be easier to see how far 4TB RAID 1 takes me and just upgrade to RAID 5/6 (if you can do that) from there if it looks like I can use all of those drives? Honestly I didn't really think about that until now.
 Also, hardware or software RAID? Every time I look it up I see hardware RAID is a headache or software RAID is a headache, so I have no idea what the current consensus is.
 Thanks for any help.

 When the ALB receives connection request from port 443, it will forward to my target group with http setup. It has my ssl certificate attached 
 Then in cloudfront, I set my ALB as the origin, and then set HTTPS, redirect http to https, and put my domain as the alternative domain and the ssl certificate. (Same as my ALb cert) 
 And then I added the Alias record 
 domain.com -> my cloudfront endpoint
 But after 15mins, when I refresh my pages, the cache is missed, it directly accessed to my origin. I don’t know if it’s related to the cachedisabled feature I set up in cloudfront…. 
 Do you guys have any ideas?

 I searched on github but most of the scripts are outdated and none seems to be able to download books which you dont "own". 
 Maybe a person with the skill is able to write a script this weekend. Sadly I dont have the knowledge to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I noticed that sometime within the last month or so most of the data on my two hard drives have become corrupted. I'm not sure what happened, but I can verify that it did based on an earlier cloud backup and some other backup I have on another machine. 
 I was wondering what is the best way to go about having some system to routinely check if the data has become corrupted? I could hand roll some script to calculate md5 sums for each file. I also thought about making one big torrent for each hard drive so I can verify the checksums that way. Are there any other standard methods of doing so?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! I'm just starting out with self-hosting, and have managed to set up a nice host of services on an old laptop I had laying around. I'm now at a point where I feel like the next few services I want to get running would involve long-term data storage, so attaching several disks for backup purposes would be essential
 My question is: how feasible would it be to attach drives through usb? The laptop motherboard only has one free SATA port available, but two usb ports. Would I run into issues with read/write speeds? How relevant is that question when considering data backups? And if I used a usb hub, would that make a significant difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am trying to figure out if this makes sense and if I am on the right track. Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. 
 I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. 
 Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this? I have looked around (Google) but if anyone has done this (or something similar), has a better alternative or can point to a good guide I appreciate the feedback.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 For a webapp of mine, Excel file/ODS/CSV import feature was requested, however instead of supporting a fix scheme(s), they wish to have bigger flexibility: some columns should be optional, sometimes the numbers, dates are formatted differently (because of the different locales) in those sheets, sometimes there could be a header row, or the values are starting at the 5th row, etc.
 I think these requirements are pretty general, they've certainly come up a lot, in a lot of software - personally I had to build it a couple of times, so I'm a bit borred now, and started thinking how to solve it generally. So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.
 Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situation: Migrating away from Google apps for domains to mxroute/own existing domain and a self-hosted instance (probably mailcow) for the "archive". Using the time to remove a decade+ of online mail.
 Desire: Have the "old" mail (maybe greater than a year or so) available on the LAN through a service for the rare time it needs to be checked. Maybe in the future "add" new "old mail" to it. 
 Need: A good user interface with search. It does not need to be reachable for mail routing obviously.
 Thoughts: Mailcow via Docker, pull mail in with imap sync from Google before migrating to mxreoute solution.
 But... any better solution/anything I've overlooked for this family solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm facing the issue that moving from one server to another (which shouldn't happen often, yet has to happen at some point), is a huge burden to even think about.
 So... the answer to this is... obviously, containerization, where we separate applications from data. Let's talk docker.
 However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.
 Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?
 Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.
 But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.
 How do you handle this issue? Do you have cron jobs that restart your containers every now and then and upgrade the images so that security fixes can come over? What do you do?

 How to get started:
  
Install Python. There is a standalone .exe but this just makes it easier to upgrade and all that
 
Run pip install gallery-dl in command prompt (windows) or Bash (Linux)
 
From there running gallery-dl <url> in the same command line should download the url's contents
 
 config.json
 The config.json is located at %APPDATA%\gallery-dl\config.json (windows) and /etc/gallery-dl.conf (Linux)
 If the folder/file doesn't exist, just making it yourself should work
 The basic config I recommend is this. If this is your first time with gallery-dl it's safe to just replace the entire file with this. If it's not your first time you should know how to transplant this into your existing config

Offices will reopen on Monday, November 21st. .. We look forward to working with you on Twitter’s exciting future."
  
​
  
Story to be updated soon with more: Am hearing that several “critical” infra engineering teams at Twitter have completely resigned. “You cannot run Twitter without this team,” one current engineer tells me of one such group. Also, Twitter has shut off badge access to its offices.
  
​
  
What I’m hearing from Twitter employees; It looks like roughly 75% of the remaining 3,700ish Twitter employees have not opted to stay after the “hardcore” email. 
 Even though the deadline has passed, everyone still has access to their systems.
  
​
  
“I know of six critical systems (like ‘serving tweets’ levels of critical) which no longer have any engineers," the former employee said. "There is no longer even a skeleton crew manning the system. It will continue to coast until it runs into something, and then it will stop.” 
 Resignations and departures were already taking a toll on Twitter’s service, employees said. “Breakages are already happening slowly and accumulating,” one said. “If you want to export your tweets, do it now.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So one of my clients at work has an iMac that is used as a Data Server. They are in the process of upgrading it to an actual Apple Server but it is a slow process due to cost. 
 The problem is, they have 4 external hard drives that are used for backup purposes. Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.
 I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available. Open to any ideas, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all.
 I am thinking of building a DIY DAS, with a SilverStone DS380 and 8xHDD, but I need something odd that maybe does not exist.
 I would need to connect my DAS through an USB interface (USB3.0 is enough for mechanical HDD), so I am looking for an interface that convert the SATA or MiniSAS connectors to an external USB connector, preferably with a PCI bracket to fit the PCI slots of the case.
 To sum up, I need something like a SSF8087 to SSF8088 adapter (pic below) but SSF8087 to USB instead.
 https://tinypic.host/i/yhZkj
 I do not find anything similar to it, but thinking about all the commercial DAS (Yottamaster, IcyBox, Mediasonic...), they all have an external USB interface, that expose the SATA/SAS HDD in the interior, so the card must exist. 
 Thanks in advance.

 What solution do I need? ZFS? RAID?
 I need to be able to access the files as if I would access regular disk on the system

Supermicro sys-210p-frdn6t

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just bought into VMUG and am excited to reconfigure my whole ESXi setup. I'll be using clustering for the first time and I think I know the answer to this but I wanted to be sure.
 My cluster for the time being is going to be a bunch of old laptops - I have a dl380p but it's physically elsewhere for a while. I have 2gbe through Google Fiber and the switches to support the throughput, but if I cluster these old laptops together and one of them doesn't have a NIC capable of that speed, then the whole cluster is going to suffer from a bottleneck across all resources right? 
 I guess I don't understand how to determine the bandwidth necessary for resource access in a cluster and if there is a determinable max throughput or if it's just "the more the better." 
 My question summarized though is: Will I bottleneck ESXi cluster performance if one of the nodes has a NIC that is significantly slower than the others?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm completely clueless about this stuff.
 I have a huge collection of obscure gaming books and materials. Including scans of rare developer interviews.
 I was reading the ArchiveTeam wiki and I found out that you can upload to archive.org using a torrent.
 https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Internet_Archive#Uploading_to_archive.org
 "Torrent upload, useful if you need resume (for huge files or because your bandwidth is insufficient for upload in one go)"
 I don't have the best equipment so I want to use this method in case I have some sort of interruption.
 Is it recommended to use torrent upload? Is there any file size limits to it? Can it handle 10gb+ uploads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 today my esxi 6.x is running on an old mac mini (2011, with a thunderbolt network adapter). It run mostly my pfsense firewall and some small test instances.
 With esxi 6.x endoflife, and VMUG only having esx i7.x + licences, I would like to move to a more uptodate hardware to use esxi 7.x.
 It need to be able to have 2 NICs (maybe one through thunderbolt or usb adapter) to run my pfsense firewall.
 Noise is also a concern, it will be on 24/7 in a small apartment.
 I understand most of the recent NUC may cover that ?
 ​
 I would also like to try GPU&USB passthrough with windows to be able to run windows virtual hosts and some 'game' on it. My main computer is a mac mini.
 How is the GPU passthrough with esxi 7.x and windows ? is it always a gamble for each hardware / software update ?
 Can I find a small SFF that I can add a modern graphic card ? or a 'tower' model with a modern graphic card that work ? Do I need to look at more 'server' style hardware (more noisy) ?
 Or forget about GPU passthrough and simply by an XBOX for Christmas ?
 ​
 Thanks.

 I don't want real bulky NAS that's why I chose this router because it's a portable solution.
 I'm in doubt which disk type to use. I need around 1TB of space. 
 Should I use 2.5 mechanic disk which may require additional power via usb hub which is less practical? Also I'm concerned about writing speed for a lot of small files like git repos or similar?
 Or should I use $70 nvme disk with 30$ usb adapter which is more expensive option but more performant?
 Another option is 50$ 512GB micro sd card which is less space and not so performant but could be an option.
 Which option should I choose?

I've been doing the later with about a dozen different distros, just periodically checking to see if they've been updated and downloading the new one manually. Works fine for a few ISOs, but it becomes a pain with more. Just wondering how other people are doing this.
 I've been bamboozled, y'all are just a bunch of horny nerds 🤣 
 More seriously, it looks like rsync and cron jobs is the smart way to go for actual Linux ISOs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit to answer FAQ: hardware choices are for cost and versatility, the whole budget for this build is under $350. Raid config is RAID 10 + 1 hot spare and four more drives on hand to swap in for failures. I am not afraid to cut holes in this case. 
 I've also posted this over on homeserver, but the level of jank I'm striving for fits a lot better here I think. 
 I'm currently working on building a home file server that could potentially host both Plex and Pi-Hole. I've already got the drives on the way but I have not ordered the rest of the hardware. Right now I am bidding on an auction for an Optiplex 7040 MT, i7-6700 with 8GB RAM. There will be a dedicated SSD for the OS. I know that the specs will be sufficient for any of the individual uses, but will they be enough for all three at once? Also, what would be the best way to install 11 drives? I'm not afraid of jank, so "creative" solutions are welcome. My array plans are for 11 2TB drives with 10 TB logical storage for full parity with 1 hot spare. I will also have 4 cold spares. Here are the solutions I'm looking for ideas on: 1. software. Currently thinking about Samba but would be open to any other free options
  
power. Will the 240w dell power supply be enough for 11 spinning platters or do I need another solution?
 
connection. Do I need to use a specific PCIe expansion card to make sure my OS can see all the drives?
 
physical mounting. How the heck can I get 11 drives connected to this thing?
 
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, selfhosted community,
 We're excited to announce that we launched Automatisch, an open-source Zapier alternative. We have been working on it for more than a year together with u/farukaydin and started to get early adopters. Now it's time to announce it to more prominent communities.
 In case you don't know what Zapier is, it is a product that allows end users to integrate the web applications they use and automate workflows.
 If you want to check it out directly, you can use the following links:
 Website: automatisch.io
 Docs: automatisch.io/docs
 GitHub: https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch
 If you want to check out the screenshots of the product:
  
Apps
 Flows
 Editor
 Executions
 Execution details
  
There are existing solutions like Zapier or Make in the market, but we still wanted to build Automatisch as an open-source alternative because you can keep your data on your own servers with Automatisch. It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.
 You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.
 Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.
 ​
 Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.

 Obviously any reports are going to be anecdotal and not a guarantee, but I'm curious as to if any of you have experience with used enterprise drives and reliability in that region of use.
 From my own personal experience, it seems that if a drive is destined to die it tends to die relatively quickly, and the ones I've had in the past that made it to 10,000 hours typically lasted another 50k+.
 Ultimately I spent £30 a pop on each of these, so I'm tempted to just consider it a good deal regardless and put it out of my mind. Am I crazy?

 Given these facts, would you: 
 1- Get 2x EnSky EWS377AP (old line)
 2- Get 2x EWS377-Fit and 1x FitController 
 3- Burn all EnGenius **** and replace with something else, please suggest (not cloud managed).

 Thank you

More specifically, we rarely talk about the process of restoring, if it works, how well it works, etc. I read many folks say they couldn't restore cause of a corrupted backup because of the backup tool they used -- not cool.
 So, I'm wondering, for folks who have had to restore data and it was successful, what tool were you using to do the backup + restore? Comment with your thoughts/experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All
 I've recently been trawling the internet for an alternative to Cloudflare to sit my Plex/Emby behind, the most promising I've found is GCore, they're pretty upfront, you get 1TB, after that you pay - cool.. 
 But then I found Yakucap which is listed on ProductHunt, its got quite a few reviews etc, it got "product of the day" etc. 
  
https://www.producthunt.com/products/yakucap
 https://yakucap.com/
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js4R8scCDfk
  
It looks promising and probably worth bookmarking, but I'd say approach with caution for now - researching on LinkedIn, TrustPilot, and Y Combinator etc, their presence elsewhere is surface-thin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my personal mastodon server ran out of space. Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:
 Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.
 Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.
 I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.
 From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.
 Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.
 (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple years ago i was really into old games and collected a lot of them from yard sales, ebay, traded them with friends. I knew what i already got for the most part, but i never really made a list/labeled them. In total i guess somewhere around 250 floppys & 4-5000 cds.
 Since many of them are nearly 20 years some even older, i am looking for a way to digitalis them.
 The first thing, is there an efficient way/program to convert them to isos?
 The second thing, are you familiar with any archive/collection management program thats selfhosted and where you could link the said isos?
 (Like Collectorz just Selfhosted, Browserbased & OpenSource)
 Thanks for any ideas

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Perhaps I’m just lucky and haven’t lost a drive but I feel like between SMART monitoring and using single addressable drives my 24 bay media server using drives on their own is running well.
 I’ve been considering some pooled sort of RAID like unraid or omv zfs for many years, and realize it means the loss of one drive for parity, but overall the bigger fear is that something will go wrong that will trash the entire pool of Files versus just one drives worth of content - tv and movie files which could be replaced. Anyone else have similar fears and how did you resolve? I just worry the implosion of say 100tb of a pool would be riskier than losing a regular 14tb drive. My drives are all of various size btw ranging from 5tb to 14tb all gutted from desktop cases so not bleeding edge. Also isn’t raid going to run slower than jbod on my 4u Xeon rackmount?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Kubero aims to be the most similar clone to run Heroku on your own Kubernetes (Cloud or selfhosted). It is 100% open-sourced.
 3 weeks ago, I promised this subreddit, I would build a CLI for Kubero, when the main repository reaches 100 ⭐. Thank you for this motivation booster. So here I am to deliver too.
 Kubero now has a CLI. And the best part is: It comes with an installer. So it is super easy to play around on your local environment. Spin up a Kind Kubernetes cluster, install OLM and Kubero just by running kubero install. This will start the fully guided installation.
 This is the current command tree:
  kubero ├── apps │ ├── create │ ├── fetch │ ├── list │ └── delete ├── config │ ├── addons │ ├── buildpacks │ └── podsizes ├── help ├── init ├── install └── pipelines ├── create ├── fetch ├── list └── delete 
 v0.0.3 is ready to download here: https://github.com/kubero-dev/kubero-cli/releases/latest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent power price increases have hit our country hard, and a discussion with the CEO and CFO at Chez Knurpel led to a review of the heavy power users. Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.
 The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)
 Sorry, lights out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of DRM-free games on my NAS. I often use steam in big-picture mode. Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.
 It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.
 My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. 
 Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line? Thoughts?

 It's a long shot, but there is a chance someone had a similar issue. 
 The trouble is, at the very end on the system load, the NetApp "blinks", all the drives disconnect for a moment and then reconnect.

 I think, something is faulty in my box. Either an LSI or the NetApp. This exact same thing happened in Ubuntu and now happens in the TrueNAS Scale.
 I have two cables, so far, I tried to connect a single cable to NetApp IOM1. I didn't try it with only IOM2. That would be a next thing to try, but I am not eager to mess with my data without absolute need.
 So far, I managed to load, by unplugging the NetApp, booting the NAS and hot-plugging it back. zpool import picks up the pool with no issues.
 Have anyone experienced anything similar?
 Thank you.

 I work for a company and we have digital files (raw footage, photos, edits, and project files) stored on about 100 HDDs, most are Lacie 2TB to 5TB capacity drives. We also keep a copy of these drive's contents on a cloud-based DAM system.
 I want to us to have a third storage option for our content so that we abide by the 3-2-1 rule and that considers long term storage, I'd say for the next 10-15 years.
 Altogether, we probably have close to 100 TB of data that would not need to be accessed frequently (we use the DAM for that). What are some storage/backup recommendations for this case?

 Fast forward to when the drives arrive; packaging seemed ok. I tested them one by one and discovered 1/6 was DOA, the 5/6 booted but when I tried to take a SMART, it simply wouldn't perform the TEST. It wasn't that there was an error per se, it simply wouldn't perform the test. 
 Weary of putting any data on the 5/6 drives even if they recognize. I email their support regarding the issue looking for a resolution. No real response for a week until they sent an email that it was forwarded to their 'IT" department; however what was weird was the ticket was 'closed'. 
 I emailed again to reopen the ticket 3-4 days later but no response. I emailed again another 3-4 days later with the same result. They are simply ignoring the support ticket even though there is a DOA Warranty for 30 days. I'm well paste the 30days and had to pay UPS customs/duties of $185. 
 BUYER BEWARE: I heard good things about these guys from the serverbuild forums years ago and thought I would give them a try. I am sorely mistaken with their overall lack of honesty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I work in a media production business and am looking for some advice on our current archival process. 
 Our projects are typically each 0.5 - 2TB in size, totalling up to 20TB per year, contain mostly media files like video, images, audio and project save files, anywhere between a few hundred to a few thousand files per project. 
 Currently, we keep a copy of the project backed up on an office raid server as hot storage.
 As warm storage we .RAR the project into multiple 300GB .rars and store on external drives.
 As cool storage we copy those .RARs to LTO tape. 
 If projects get old, we eventually delete the Hot storage off the server, leaving only the .rar on external drive and lto.
 My worry is the reliance on the .RARs. Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.
 I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.
 The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. 
 What do you guys think about this current workflow?

 I really appreciate any input. These discs will be used very heavily. For me the most important factor is reliability. Premier failed disc has resulted in loss of happiness.
 The price is also dropped and for the first time, these seem like they can fit into the budget.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Hard for me to summarize this, so apologies for block of text. I'll try to bold the more important bits. Thanks in advance.
 I have a 12U Gator rack I won't be using now that I'm selling my DJ equipment, and I want to build a reasonably quiet gaming desktop that's rackmounted. It'll fit nicely with the Furman power conditioner and shelf.
 In case it helps, here's my current PC Part Picker list.
 My problems begin with the rack's depth only being 16.5".
 That makes finding a rackmount chassis that fits difficult enough. So far the best one I've found (15" deep, reasonable price) looks to be here:
 Sliger CX4150a
 I'd love to find some 6U or 8U unit so I could get loads of fans running at low speed to keep it quiet and a bunch of 5.25" bays, but north of 4U appears to be either unicorns, or priced as unicorns. The two other variants of that linked one above ("i" and "e" suffixes) have one or two 5.25" bays, but can't fit a deep power supply like that "a" variant.
 I don't intend to have dozens of drives hooked up daily or anything. I just want three to four 5.25" bays available for 1) a Blu-Ray drive, 2) at least one 3.5" hot-swap bay, and 3) at least one 2.5" hot-swap bay.
 So I'm wondering if it's possible to have a separate case mounted directly above or below the linked one, and run the SATA and power cables to it (plus extra fans, I assume) for these drives?
 This subreddit just introduced me to "JBOD" (funniest acronym ever?), but even with that hint, most of what I'm finding is still into four figures. I'm literally just looking for a 1-2U piece with a handful of 5.25" bays that wouldn't be too difficult to link into from the other piece.
 Anyone have ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to get a new storage solution for what's now about 25 TB of data (mostly video files) with room to grow at several TB per year. We previously had some DROBO units but due to downsizing we got rid of the server they were attached to and the units basically bricked when we tried to update the firmware with the intent of moving and repopulating them. So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. 
 I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? 
 To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this, as my research consistently leaves me with as many questions as answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been trying to bypass Wi-Fi blocks at a place I go to frequently. I have my own server at home or on Azure to run it.
 I've tried OpenVPN and Wireguard (with algo). OpenVPN refuses to connect and Wireguard connects however I cannot search or directly connect to IPs (it does work on other networks.) Another thing I've noticed is that I'm able to connect to my Minecraft server, but not join as it cannot connect to Mojang's authentication servers. I'm not completely sure of how the block works though, since I am unable to connect to any VPNs on that port. Let me also point out, Hotspot Shield's "Hydra" protocol is able to bypass these blocks but I'm not paying for a VPN if I know there is some way out there to bypass these blocks.
 From what I know:
 The network has its own DNS, using Google's or Cloudflare's just results in a "The connection reset" page instead of the block placeholder page. The network also has it's own search domain (on macOS)
 If you have any questions about the requirements, let me know and I'll reply to the best of my ability.

Obviously need something that can accept data at a good rate, I have 1250mbps up but fine with 500mbps up or so. I'd like to keep it around $100 a month. I'm ok paying something to download, if things go well I would never download. TIA

I would like to create an NGINX Proxy Manager as a container with the same parent interface ovs_bond0 that I created a macvlan from for my AdGuard Home container. 
 Tried creating a macvlan from the same parent interface ovs_bond0 that I used for AdGuard Home:
 sudo docker network create -d macvlan -o parent=ovs_bond0 --subnet=192.168.7.0/24 --gateway=192.168.7.1 --ip-range=192.168.7.253/32 npm_network 
 I get an error after running the command:

 I am trying to use the network that AdGuard Home (running as a container) is currently using. Here's the output the macvlan I created for AdGuard Home.
 "Name": "adg-home_network", "Created": "2022-11-14T14:58:47.62068652-08:00", "Scope": "local", "Driver": "macvlan", "EnableIPv6": false, "IPAM": { "Driver": "default", "Options": {}, "Config": [ { "Subnet": "192.168.7.0/24", "IPRange": "192.168.7.254/32", "Gateway": "192.168.7.1"
 It seems like Docker does not allow you to create a macvlan with a gateway (192.168.7.1) that is already being used. Can I set this up with the same gateway 192.168.7.1 for the macvlan for NGINX Proxy Manager? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.

 My 2TB 5200RPM Drive its having a long death, so time to find its replacement. 
 Im running a Xeoma Docker instance, connected to around 16 IP Cameras, Resolution 4MP, all H265, each has a data load of around .5 - 2MB/s with my current settings, so a total for all the cameras 30 - 40MB/s. 
 My current WD Golds data transfer average its 180MB/s, so that means a 7200RPM drive can handle a lot of cameras (64 Cameras)... Im thinking my numbers are probably way off. 
 But well, the latest Seagate 2TB its having a premature death, so maybe this setup its a little hard on the HDD's.... or not?. 
 Would it be better to setup an small 512 / 1TB SSD as a cache of the recordings*?, and then send each day to the HDD?. Not sure if a lot of writes are better handled with a Enterprise SSD, or a spinnning one. 
 *For the unfamiliar, Unraid can use SSD's as cache, and a little script called "Mover" can send the data to the HDD at certain intervals, generally each night. 
 Current Setup:
 2TB Seagate, Single Pool Device, BTFRS partition. 
 Requirements: * No need to have parity protection on this data. * Try to not kill the HDD / SSD too fast. * Able to handle future expansion, maybe 20 - 30 cameras in total
 In other subject... -- Are the CCTV HHD Drives any different?. 
 Thanks!

After seeing the post a couple days ago about local cost vs cloud cost I put a power meter on my server and did some math:
 After 1 day, 22 hours, and ~30 minutes I used 2.318 KWh. https://i.imgur.com/NS7udB2.jpg
 So that boils down to 2.318 KWh over 1.9375 days or ~1.2KWh/day
 At my (admittedly low) rate that averages ~10cents/KWh with a high of 12cents/KWh i average ~$45-$55/year on power for my server.

 The hoard is on a Synology serving Nvidia Shields and Kodi. I was using Tiny to scrape the metadata and had Kodi pulling it locally instead of searching the net (faster and organized/renamed the files). 
 I'm open to other ways of doing this that do not involve Plex.

 I wrote some scripts for converting the UTZOO Usenet archive to a Mongo Database.
 Background
 I recently found out about the UTZOO Usenet Archive, a collection of something like two million Usenet posts archived by Henry Spencer from 1981 to 1991. I wanted to play around with the data, so I wrote some Node script to convert the files to a Mongo database. It's a little bit hacky, but it works.
 Getting the data:
 The data was available on the Internet Archive. You could download the data from the UTZOO Usenet Archive page. After legal demands were placed requesting the internet archive to remove the data, the data was removed and replaced with its checksum. Fortunately, some friendly folks on Reddit have preserved the data. You can download the UTZOO archive from …]]></summary>

 I was hoping you lovely folks of /r/selfhosted would be willing to partake in a short (maximum 6 question) survey! TLDR at the bottom
 Context: I was looking at setting up a couple services from scratch a few weeks ago and thought to myself, "I wonder if I can just buy something with it already installed." So I've been looking into it and I personally have not been successful in finding any kind of seller that provides this (self hosting as a service?). I have played around the idea a bit in my head and I am of the belief that there may be a few that would be possible with this method of deployment. 
 Those of you who have went through the pains of starting to self-host for the first time, or those of you that are just busy: Yes or no, please let me know! This survey is completely anonymous. https://forms.gle/bXZSfXjAzoa1FsyS9
 TLDR: I want to know if a "pre-built" device containing requested services is something you would ever consider purchasing over setting it up from scratch yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set up a Nginx server and, for one web application, it forwards request to tools/ to a webapp hosted locally on Tomcat (version 9). In the webapp, however, are a couple of javacript scripts and some pngs and the requests for those aren't getting forwarded.
 The Nginx is behind SSL, but is connecting to a Tomcat which is not.
 Here is the relevant config: https://pastebin.com/M12m3qDr
 The domain monkeypower.co.uk is only accessible on my local network. What have I missed? I know I could host these files on the Nginx server and have them served statically, but I'd rather keep them in one place and it's only a couple of files and only being served occasionally on my local network, so ease of config/development seems to me to be mroe important than performance.
 What am I missing?
 Also, I noticed that Caddy is an Nginx alternative - can it do forwarding to Tomcat? Would it be a better option for this kind of thing?

 I'm currently running it with 128gb. 4x 32gb rdimm ddr4 2400T. Looking to add 2x sticks of 128gb optane pmem. Will bring the machine from 128gb ddr4 to 384gb of "Memory Mode" space... 
 #1: I am unclear whether or not ALL DIMM speeds need to match, or can I combine 2x 128gb sticks of pmem100 @ 2666 with 4x sticks of rdimm 2400T? Will the optane pmem dimms clock down or will it just not work? 
 #2: It is my understanding that on this motherboard, optane dimms only works in memory mode. Is that correct? The description says "up to 1tb in memory mode". Can you run less than 1TB in different modes? 
 #3: TPM Modules: I have to buy a SM branded module right? Are there other options or just get the SM part from a known vendor? 
 #4: Anything else I should know?

I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct? Any decent places to pick up some ram?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 This has been bugging me for a while. There are great options for replacing the majority of what music services like Spotify or Apple Music do - Jellyfin, Plex, etc, supported by software like Lidarr and the like, to make it easy to self-host your music library, expand it, access it with ease from anywhere with a plethora of clients etc.
 The one thing that's missing, to my knowledge, is a discoverability/recommendation engine. Features like 'Daily Mix', dynamic playlists that encompass popular songs from a particular category, 'Discover Weekly' etc. These are IME very nice features for discovering new music and expanding your music library.
 Is there something out there that's usable with something like Jellyfin? I know there are tools like Gnoosic and TasteKid but these are external tools that can't really hook into the 'stack' so to speak.

 So I'm currently digitising all my grandma's photos from pictures from the 1950s and 1960s right through to the 2000s and 2010s. I was just wondering how you'd organise them all? (1000+). At the moment I've got a folder for each person, then within that I've got "Group" folder "Solo" folder and "Documents" folder. But when multiple people are in the group photos, having 10/15 copies of one photo seems overkill. There must be a better way to approach this? 
 Would love to see any examples whether it's screenshots or links to a folder set up. Just any help would be much appreciated! Also naming conventions too. Initially I had "Surname, First Name - Event" however, my grandma has 11 siblings so I can't list everyone within that. 
 I'll be using Google Drive to share the photos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get some thoughts on a setup to segregate my network a little bit using my current ASUS ac3100 router. I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.
 Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense
 Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.
 Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.

 But now there is the noop question. When I have all the data on my new NAS, will I be able to still use the M1 power? Or do I need to build a powerful CPU into my NAS??
 Or differently spoken; where is the Power needed? On the Maschine that is running Final Cut, or on the nas?
 Sorry, I really struggle to build this question in the way I mean it. But I hope my problem becomes clear and someone can help.

 From what I read, I will need to add the driver for the NIC but the storage controller should work.
 It's the tall version so I should have space to put an SSD 2.5.
 I will add RAM.

 Do you see any problem?

 Ive been looking a bit for an internal Reverse Proxy for my Homelab.
 I do not need any external proxy functionality, since I already use NGINX Proxy Manager for that. I just want an internal proxy.
 I plan on just using something like cluster.lan.local to get to my Proxmox Cluster Webinterface, if the proxy could also load balance the request, in case the first Node being down, that would be perfect.
 I thought about just using keepalived on my nodes and setting a custom DNS entry on my Pihole, but there has to be a better way to do that, right?

 Something that I managed to snag from work since it was going to be recycled otherwise.It was an appliance we use for Control Case. Something that scans our network for stuff. IDK exactly, it is above my pay grade.It all looks to be Supermicro stuff with a sticker on it. All the model numbers had that make. Case, board, PSU, I think the NIC.I am going to use it as a NAS since I was already using a i5-4570k for that and the hardware I picked up looks to be the exact same with server/enterprise bits tacked on. I just need to get a LSI/SAS/HBA card. eBay and y'all say $40ish for that. And a new case. Rack mounted stuff just doesn't work in my place.
 But the hardware mounted inside:
 Supermicro X10SLL-F mobo
 Xeon E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz
 32GiB ECC RAM
 2 port Intel Ethernet card with a model number of AOC-SGP-i2 on it
 2x 2TB Mech SATA HDDs. I think. I didn't pull those out, they didn't have it explicitly written on them, and I am taking a guess from the model number which has a 2000 in the front.
 It boots. I got to a VMWare screen but didn't have any of the passwords. Wonder if they will give them to me. But then I got high, watched the Bolts, and played video games. I will mess with it more during the weekend.
 Added pictures. I thought I added those.

 Probably the most useful addition in this release is the addition of a Docker image, which should make deploying or trying out whalewall much easier. Full changelog is here, please let me know what you think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese companies will literally manufacture anything. Amazon is full of new cassette players recently manufactured but no one makes an affordable solutions to play those old video files. 
 Just curious why that is? I recently digitized a lot of old Hi8, mini DV, and vhs tapes and I had to buy a 25 year old Hi8 player because my parents old one didn't power on when I started the project. It was like 100 dollars for a piece of 25 year old tech, lol. It just seems like SOME company out there has to make one, and I'm not looking in the right places online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife and I just picked up shiny new Pixel 7/Pro's and plan to take a whole bunch of videos in 4k of our family, kids, etc. However after seeing what 5 minutes of a 4k video eats up, I'm starting to worry about the limits of my 2tb plan. I saw there were some options, including buying a pixel 1... or paying $30/month for google enterprise that has either a 5tb or potentially unlimited space. 
 Two questions - is the latter still a thing, or is it limited to 5tb? If it's limited, wouldn't it just make sense for me to pay for 5tb plan on google one for $20/year (annual)? 
 And second, is there a better option out there? Or am I worrying for nothing and probably won't hit even my 2tb limit anytime soon?

Currently this is pretty overkill for what I need and I am looking at downsizing to a regular tower. I am stuck between buying a motherboard to house one of the 2695 and half the ram and then try sell the rest. The other option I am considering is moving to a epyc 7302, and then I can sell the R720 as a whole, which I think I would have more luck. I am not 100% sure if the move from a 2695 to a 7302 is really worth the $1200 CAD it will cost me or if I'm better to just use what I have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tl;Dr: Is virtualizing FreeNAS/TrueNAS in Proxmox alongside having other VMs for other functions a good idea?
 I have a vague idea of what I'm doing but at the end of the day I'm learning still.
 Purpose of this project: Half of it is to take some functionality off my main gaming rig and put it into a server that can run 24/7, and the other half is to experiment and learn some neat things. Right now, my server of choice is an Optiplex 5060 w/ i7-8700 and 32gb of ECC RAM.
 Things I want my server to run: NAS with Plex Minecraft Server Opnsense (this is something I'm not gonna touch for a while but it's a project I want to tackle once I get the ball rolling)
 This is it at the moment but there could be more things I want to do.
 For the NAS, unlike alot of people here, while I like the idea of having a NAS for storing media, I don't see myself needing to hoard alot of data. At most, maybe about 2tb for some TV shows, movies, and other things I want to save. So I was thinking of picking up 2 2tb drives of the Seagate IronWolf drives new and put them in a RAID 1 for redundancy. Of course, they will also be backed up in a cloud solution.
 After doing a lot of research it seems like Proxmox is the way to go for virtualization. I also seen that virtualizing your NAS is doable but it requires an HBA card for stability and performance. I seen this video that seems pretty reliable on how to virtualize your NAS. Think this video is good enough?
 And then I can just simply create a VM of Windows 10 for my Minecraft server.

I'm looking at about 100-300 GB of data. I have apple, windows and linux laptops, also proxmox servers. What I don't have, is a clear-cut solution to syncing OneDrive to iCloud Drive. Two-way sync would be nice, but it's not a must.
 My preferred Apple laptop for this application is an old retina MacBook Pro 2013 that doesn't run Monterey, but I'm willing to buy some SH Mac Mini for this situation. Currently the solution is more important than the cost TBH bceasue I'm looking for a set and forget scenario.
 I'm hoping others can describe solutions if in a similar situation. I was thinking of the following:
 Option 1: Setup a macOS system to do the syncing. Setup OneDrive and iCloud Drive to "keep all files locally" and then rsync between the two folders. 
 Pros:
  
native syncing of iDrive
  
Cons:
  
my macOS laptop for this "application" is a bit old (2013 rMBP) which is currently unsupported. I don't want to run unsupported OSes for security reasons and I don't want workarounds, especially when settings this up for the next few years;
 dedicated Apple Hardware to do the task, whereas Windows VMs might do the trick;
 Unable to check if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and healthy. When OneDrive might fail, it could desync, but worst case scenario I think it could completely wipeout 
  
Option 2 Run a Windows VM, signed in to iCloud Drive and OneDrive, both setup to keep all files on device.
 Pros:
  
cheapest and most portable
  
Issues:
  
as above, unable to automcatically check and resolve if iCloud Drive and OneDrive are signed in and sync is healthy.

 I have a laptop hard drive I want to plug into my PC right now to copy a back up of it. My pc is already running 2 hard drives and my SSD with windows 11 on it. I want to confirm that it is safe to plug in the laptop hard drive to sata and it won't automatically format it or anything. It has data that is important on it that we don't want to lose so I thought it would be easiest to plug into my pc and extract a copy. It also has a copy of windows on the laptop HDD. I am just asking to make sure. I've done it before with another laptop hard drive, but I just am making sure again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm completely missing the basics of how Wireguard should work on a router... I'm using a Cudy X6 router. Love it, and it has Wireguard built in as both a client and server, but I can't seem to wrap my head around how to actually set it up!
 Here's what I'm working with.
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/jsjpzkguj70a1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=090fa475379a92cf812c33505dd0ff6da628977b
 I thought, from my limited understanding, that the IP Address is what I would use when connected to access devices that are on Wireguard. Under Clients, I have this set up... is this just my router IP address as the Hostname and what IP address I'd like to use to connect to it over Wireguard?
 ​

 Thank you. I feel like I'm missing something fundamental, but there's little to no help on this specific server, and generic Wireguard tutorials haven't gotten me there.
 Ultimately, I'm trying to access ANY device on my network when connected via Wireguard.

 What I was wondering, is if I could run a local ad service with no actual ads that would allow me to not really have ads but allow mobile games to "think" there was an ad. So basically redirecting my DNS to spoof the real ad server and tell the game that the ad was successful and give me the perk.
 There may be some questionable morals here but they started it by giving more ad time than actual game play.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current home server (a Gigabyte Brix with 16GB of memory) is becoming too small for my needs. Therefore I am looking for a new home server. There are two options I can't decide between are:
 Option 1: Desktop PC as a server
 As my needs often change, I am considering building a desktop PC as my server (Example CPU: Intel Pentium Gold G7400T (TDP 35W), obviously no graphics card and an efficient Power Supply). Since this would allow me to, later on, add more parts (e.g. more drives, upgrade to 2.5GBase LAN, etc...). 
 Option 2: Intel NUC
 Or go with an Intel NUC (with an Intel Core i5-1135G7), as it is a very nice all-in-one solution with just a 12W TDP. 
 To my Question:
 How high is the power consumption for such a Desktop PC as I have described above, especially in comparison to an Intel NUC? What are your recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi datahoarders,
 I hope this is the right place. Over the years my iPhone photos and videos have numbered 300,000 with a total of 1.8 terabytes of cloud space. 
 I’d like to back these up physically but iCloud Photos on PC has severe limitations. I can’t physically download more than 999 photos at a time. 
 Im currently trying to back up my iCloud to Photo folder to google drive then use google drive to download everything on my eternal hard drive directly. Will this work or have I started a path to futility? 
 I’ve tried multiple phones calls with apple support and they are unable to advise on a clear path except for I need to get a Mac.
 I saw another thread somewhere where an individual had a python script to batch download photos. 
 Just looking for the easiest solution. (I guess if I needed to buy a Mac to aid in downloading them all to a external hard drive and then return it) wouldn’t be the end of the world for me as long as that would work for a fact. 
 All advice is welcome. Thank you

 I recently bought a Huawei RH2288H V3 for a very good price, but it is way too fucking loud for my homelab purposes. Is there a way to make it quieter, or is there a 4u case that is compatible with the motherboard of this loud mf.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm currently working on becoming a Network Admin (for work) and Systems Admin(for fun because why not) and the next couple of months have finally let me get back to a server I bought a couple of months back (R720 8bay with perc 710 mini). I roughly have an idea of what I need to do to get this thing up and running but would love some insight, pointers, or just a double check on the progress I've made so far. (This server is for personal use and training by the way)
 I'm running proxmox 7.1 directly from the 8Bay HDD/SSD drives in a RAID1 configuration. (I'll update to 7.2 once everything here is confirmed) My plan is to run TrueNAS in a VM and run Plex in TrueNAS so I can access all of my personal data /LVM data inside and outside of TrueNAS without duplicating information. I've been told that running Proxmox from a live USB is the way to go and that I should:
 1.) Clone my Proxmox live USB in case of failure (makes total sense)
 2.) Flash my PERC 710 mini into IT mode so that Proxmox VMs can have direct access to the drives
 I've found a guide for flashing my raid controller @https://fohdeesha.com/docs/perc.html that I'll be using for the flashing process
 Right now the server is currently running but the OS is install directly onto 1 of 2 internal 2.5 SSDs (in a RAID1) and the RAID controller is handling this directly. I'm going to implement the changes listed above and use the internal drives only for the VMs/Containers and the OS will run from the USB. Does this sound like what I need to do or should I configure my system differently? ( In the future I want to add PCIe NVMe drives for faster storage just as a side note) Any insight is appreciated and thanks everyone

 The error doesnt bother me, i assume its because the disk is damaged. BUT! When i click "ignore" it continues, but it is incredibly slow. 
 A regular CD/DVD might take 10 minutes to save. When this error pops up, 1% progression took 30 minutes. It still works, however it works extremly slow. 
 I tried a couple of diffrent damaged disks, i tried PowerISO and AnyBurn. It produced the same result. The process is incredibly slow after the error. 
 The error came at the beggining of one CD, the other CD produced the error at the end. The latter was at 98% and took an hour after the error. The first i gave up, 1% progression after 30 minutes. 
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been attempting this for the last 2 days and it seems that every time I make some progress, I move on to the next step and I get stopped by a new issue or conflict.
 Situation:
  
1 domain name
 
1 public IP/physical machine (running Proxmox)
 
2 containers:
  
PiVPN running ddclient for Dynamic DNS and Wireguard (works and can connect to network/Proxmox UI remotely) - port 51830
 Ubuntu 20.04 which will run a Minecraft server - port 55055
 
  
My goal is that I would like to connect to my vpn remotely through Wireguard via the vpn.mydomain.io domain name and also allow a group of 10-15 friends access the Minecraft server via mc.mydomain.io. I attempted to set up a nginx reverse proxy server outside of the VPN and the Minecraft server to switch traffic respectively, but I found out that you cant put MC data behind nginx/HTTP.
 Is there any type of setup that would allow me to achieve this functionality? The MC server should essentially be open to public access and the VPN requires a Wireguard config, but both are accessed via different domain names linked to the same public IP.
 Any input is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My sister lost her husband during the height of the COVID pandemic. He had just built a new rig. I'm the family "IT call center" so she called and said it was time to organize things and asked if I could get everything off that she could still access from her laptop as needed, things that are on this PC are family paperwork, finances, wills, death certificate, etc.. Important stuff!!. She essentially said she needs the giant computer gone soon, but wants to keep literally everything in case she needs it.
 Now I know I can drag and drop files from here and there onto an ext drive, or run a backup and dump that to a drive. But is this the right way? She doesn't know where all his stuff was stored and doesn't want to miss anything I'm sure there's more than just in the "documents" folder. How can I ensure I get everything that may be on the rig worth saving?
 I've done some googling on backup software and sounds like I can achieve doing that. I guess I just want to be sure that it is the right approach?? And will I be able to give my sister a drive with a file dump? Is something like that achievable?
 Does backup software just grab entire OS? Or can I grab just every file? Sorry for the long winded post. Really not sure how to help her here and just give her an external drive where she can just access everything that may have been important on the PC. 
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, im starting to plan my next file server. It will be replacing a 56TB QNAS that operates as a volume for my Plex video server.
 Originally, I wanted that QNAS to serve the compute for the video server as well, but it just isn’t powerful enough to transcode multiple streams as once. So, for now, my gaming computer is doing that work while pulling data from the QNAS. I’d like my next box to do both.
 So, im thinking of building my own this time. I’d like to have at least a GeForce 1660 in it, since that can transcode five 4K streams at once. (We have four adults living in this house).
 So, I could use some guidance on:
 1) A motherboard that supports at least 8 RAID drives. 1a) am I better off using a RAID card or finding a motherboard with onboard RAID?
 2) in terms of case, what do you recommend? I mean, I like the hotswap bays in my QNAS, with the lights on the front showing drive activity and health. Is there any way to achieve that in a consumer build like that?
 3) I assume a midrange CPU and 8GB ram will do?
 4) OS/software - what’s the best software solution for this? Once this thing is configured,I want to be able to do remote admin from my main workstation (win10).
 Teach me Sensei! Thanks 🙏

 I imagine this wouldn't be optimal - particularly for anything requiring a graphics card to do much? But I'd be interested if it was possible.
 Thanks!

 These are apparently selling for $600. Not a terrible deal, not a great one, but 32GB ram and a 512 GB M.2 SSD seems like this could be a monster media PC or home server. 
 Wired ethernet, mini display port, and usb-c and a connections. Curious if anyone's tried or thinking about trying this with a good linux install.

 I'm not super familiar with the Synology platform as a whole, but I have a friend that has an older NAS (DS214) from Synology that they are looking to get rid of. I have been looking for something more power efficient than my dual-Xeon server, so I am going to pick it up later today.
 That being said, how safe is it to use an older NAS? How often do they receive updates, and what sort of lifespan should I expect for this device?
 It very well may be out of support already, but it meets the basic NAS requirements that I have at the moment, so provided I can secure it properly I think it'll be a great choice for my use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I've been a lurker here for quite some time, and now that I'm starting to earn some money it's time to get myself a homelab.
 I've already experimented with an HP DL380 G7, but the power consumption was just too much to run it 24/7 (I'm in France so electricity isn't cheap).
 I'd like to build a server with consumer hardware: classic ATX motherboard, Core/Ryzen CPU so I'm not stuck with a motherboard which pulls 50W alone and other hardware which isn't made to be efficient at idle.
 My problem is that I'd like to build this in a rack form factor, ideally a 2U chassis with at least a dozen 2.5" SAS/SATA bays (I plan to use SATA SSDs because of the lower power consumption compared to HDDs). I can't find such a chassis with a reasonable price tag (ideally less than 400€) and easily available in Europe (if I buy from outside of Europe, I can count 20% more for taxes and a hundred bucks for shipping).
 I have another concern: 2U chassis only accept small form factor PSUs. Can I even find a PSU which isn't rated for high powers (remember, I'm aiming to lower my idle power consumption) and which I can plug into a desktop-class ATX motherboard?
 So there are two possibilities:
  
my 2U not-too-expensive lots-of-bays consumer-hardware-compatible build is, by some miracle, possible and maybe y'all can give me some chassis references and tips;
 I'm too focused on the idea of a 2U server with consumer hardware and I've missed other solutions which may be easier and cheaper to setup, then maybe you can enlighten me ^^
  
I hope this post is comprehensible, I'm not used to write on Reddit and I'm not used to write in english either. Please don't hesitate to ask questions about my requirements, I may have missed some points!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What.a.day.
 I got this huge project dumped on my desk this afternoon, and I am hoping some of you out here would be able to give me some pointers.
 Some context:
 We produce a software used by 80-odd companies.
 We collect data from various sources:
  
Datadog: usage of the software (which user accesses which function, at what time)
 HubSpot (CRM): Which stage of onboarding each company is at (i.e.: onboarding, admins onboarded, users onboarded, trial ongoing, etc…) 
 AWS database (RDS): user information (i.e.: how many users per company, data pertaining to the app functions, etc.) 
  
The project:
 The project is straightforward: produce a self-hosted platform that aggregates all that data (from all of these sources) and produce analytics, visually. 
  
For example, how is the productivity of a specific company before and after the company started using our product. Or, how much is each company using our software. Or, how is the usage of the tool varying, week by week.
  
Basically fancy graphs. 
 And, at the end, I need to be able to share these results with said companies, via an online portal (where the company can only access their own data)—preferably securely (password protected, SSL, etc.). 
 The process:
 As far as I can see, the steps are quite straightforward, when simplified:
  
Identify where the data required is stored 
 Centralize it somewhere (probably AWS S3?)
 Feed into the data visualization platform (self-hosted) 
 Serve the output externally.
  
The question:
 What data visualization platform would meet all the criteria outlined in the brief above? 
 So far, I have identified:
  
QlikView (I believe there is a self-hosted solution)
 Tableau
 AWS QuickSight
  
None of these tick all the boxes, but it would get me started. 
 Any other suggestions?
 Edit: clarifications & punctuation.

Is there a way for me to integrate the two music sources with one server-side app or one client that will work with both music sources? While away, I could stream songs from EITHER Spotify or my home collection- like the server looks at both my at-home collection and what Spotify offers & weaves them together to send to my client app? I know if I was on my desktop w/ the music collection local, I can ask Spotify to scan & include locally stored music and then just use Spotify, but I want access to my home collection while away from home on my cell without having to close my subsonic-ish client to open Spotify & switch between them. Does anything like that even exist?

 I was wondering if there was any sort of self-hosted web server where the sole purpose is to provide a webpage that you could browse the web through, basically a browser inside of a webpage, but when you enter a URL into it, it filters it with uBlock Origin and other filtering protections first, and then renders the page.
 The goal would be to use that self-hosted webpage and access it from iOS as a means of circumventing the iOS restriction of a proper ad-blocker.

I am looking to refresh my setup soon and add more disks and I'd like to remove this old Adapter 5805 from service before it becomes an issue (already failed once and I just happened to have a backup card at that point but some data DID corrupt!). 
 ​
 However, I do enjoy having Backblaze backing up my data and I cannot swing paying for B2 so I'd like to stay on my unlimited, which means "local" storage. Do TrueNAS or Unraid offer a method to passthrough data to the OS natively (to Windows 10 in a VM hosted on the same box)? I haven't seen a way yet in researching this. I know with dedicated NAS/SAN units I could setup an iSCSI target and I've done that in the past but I wasn't sure if this is a possibility within these OSes and I also not sure if I wanted to go through that method so looking for alternatives.
 ​
 Any suggestions or info on using the data within a vm, as a local disk, on TrueNAS/Unraid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With so many people jumping into the PhotoPrism boat, I want to give a shout out to PiGallery2. Not to dis PhotoPrism - it's gorgeous - it's just too much machine for my needs.
 I have very simple, but specific, requirements for a photo... "browser"(?) but have been having a nightmare finding one that sticks.
 I just needed something that I point to my curated folder structure of photos and displays them - read-only - in a nice, quick fashion.
 PiGallery2 does this by the truckload!
 All of the others I've tried either require multiple elements to their docker-compose, try to get too clever with re-organising the photos, are too cluttered, buggy, or lock your setup into their database or specific configs.
 I can now continue to organise my photos in a way I like on my NAS - making sure the location and tagged names are all just-so - and let PiGallery2 serve them up in a simple web view for the family to browse through. Without the worry of them nausing up any files! My god, it's almost too perfect.
 I'm not affiliated with this at all, I just love it when I come across a project that does one thing and does it well!
 Because of the one-way indexing I can completely destroy the Docker container and bring it all back up again without having to re-configure the world.
 I can't see any donate buttons on the site - how does one donate to such a project? I need to go share some financial love while I'm on this high.
 OK, OK, I'll stop gushing.

 New rack: https://greatcabinets.com/product/wm/ (39"/19U model with the plexi door)
 New UPS: https://www.apc.com/us/en/product/SMT1500RM2UC/apc-smartups-line-interactive-1500va-rackmount-2u-120v-6x-nema-515r-outlets-smartconnect-port+smartslot-avr-lcd/
 Existing: Cisco Catalyst 2960X, HP Elitedesk 800 G4, HP Prodesk G4 400, 24 port patch panels x2, Xfinity modem, two 1U PDU's and some other random IoT stuff. Probably another 50lbs max so I'm guessing we're talking 150 lbs. weight max.
 The existing rack is a 12U open frame rack mounted to a brick wall in my house. The new rack is going in the same place but I want to make sure I mount it properly.
 So that's the question...what hardware should I use to mount this new rack so that all my gear doesn't spontaneously and violently meet my floor when I'm least expecting it thus ruing thousands of dollars worth of stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies in advance if this kind of question is not allowed here 😊
 I am looking to create a file sharing service that works on a local network (that's not exposed to the internet) .
 The use case: I'm from a remote African village where internet is expensive and slow, and lots of people (when I'm there) ask for commonly used Apks (mostly WhatsApp, and other utility things like pdf readers) and also some other kinds of files. When I can I share these /download for them.
 I have old mini pcs, some Raspberry Pis, and hard drives lying around and I can get a router/modem to create a local network, and I've been thinking of making something where I can keep these files and allow people to connect to a Wi-Fi network and download them. It is essential that this does not require a data plan. It is also important that it consumes as little power as possible, since it'll run on solar and preferably 24/7.
 My preliminary research has yielded Nextcloud but I'm unsure whether it'll suffice.
 Additional context: I mostly will be adding these files with a USB stick so ideally this setup will not be exposed to the internet. However having it exposed to the internet will be great provided there isn't too much additional overhead, since I can update the files, monitor it remotely etc. I want also to keep the option of adding more content open, for example educational videos, free ebooks etc.
 The question to you amazing folk then is, is this doable, what are potential gotchas, are there other ways to do it, should I use Nextcloud or something else etc. Any general advice you might have would I'll be greatly appreciated. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since this has gotten so much attention I just want to thank the guys at r/DHExchange for providing the missing issues and the guys over at https://www.retromags.com/ for providing such a great resource having most of the issues. I would also like to thank every one who uploaded different sets of these magazines on archive already. Without them putting everything together simply wouldn't be possible. I can not and will not take credit for there hard work and dedication to preservation. I just wanted to get everything together in one package for everyone to be able to have easy access to all of them. Thank you so much for all the awards and appreciation but please thank them as well. They deserve it more than I do. 
 I have every single issue of nintendo power magazine all 285 issues of it uploaded to archive.org
 https://archive.org/details/nintendo-power-issue-128
 magnet:?xt=urn:btih:8a1a883270f3f094150ce258a26b4ca581839153
 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d69aOgbHU_hrI--Ie5Xhf84fHOkk6lMd/view?usp=share_link
 magnent and back up of the original archive.org torrent.
 Last time a big set of these were on there nintendo took it down so I'm sure it will happen again sometime. Either way I have them all backed up on my hard drive as well and was wondering how a good way to preserve all of these would be. Reason being is because as far as I know from days of looking and researching. There is no complete set of these magazines outside of the one I just uploaded last night. I used many existing sources to get them all with the help of some awesome dudes I met in another subreddit who had 2 i was missing to complete the set. If anyone wants to help preserve these before nintendo comes a swinging it would be very much appreciated. Thank you all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody I have multiple external drives that I kept all my files. I have used "whereisit" software for cataloging and to save content of these discs. It was a great software because it scans all the files inside a drive and save the content of this drive to its database. Then whenever I am looking for a file I search through whereisit database without even connecting the related external drive. 
 As far as I understand from the whereisit web site it is discontinued so I am looking for an alternative software to make a catalogue of a drive. (win and macos compatibility is preferred)
 any alternative is welcomed (macos, win, docker)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not sure if this sub is exclusively for digital data, but lately, I’ve been thinking about the best way to save and preserve important physical documents.
 I’ve recently been married, and I have all of our documents organized in a binder, but I wonder if there is a better way to keep documents.
 At the moment, they are not protected from water or fire, and that is something if like to consider.
 I live in a smallish apartment, so getting a safe is kind of out of the question. Besides making good scans of the documents, can you recommend anything to keep my documents safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I have been running Nextcloud in my UnRAID for a bit now under the URL nextcloud.{mydomain}
 I have my subdomains set up in Cloudflare dashboard with a dyndns docker image to constantly grab my public ip. 
 This is all set up in SWAG by editing:
 nano /mnt/user/appdata/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/nextcloud.subdomain.conf.sample
 and linking to the nextcloud docker and domain along with the appropriate port. 
 Now, I am trying to do the same thing but with a game server for ARK. I did the same thing, and even used the nextcloud sample configuration as it is very simple, and created a theisland.{mydomain}. To my surprise this actually worked, and it pointed the connection right to the correct internal port. Making a second one for another ARK map is where things led to trouble. 
 For some reason, I created an exact copy as the one for theisland.{mydomain} but for lostisland.{mydomain}. Instead of the IP redirecting to the correct internal port, it just points to my public IP. 
 Any ideas to why this may be the case? 
 If I am missing any information please just ask.

 I am, however, interested in sticking bigger hard drives in them. I have read that they will work with 4TB drives and some 6TB drives but the 6TB can be iffy. Supposedly most of the 4TB drives out there will work. I'm curious if anyone has experience putting larger drives in them and whether or not those drives were recognized at full capacity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just got some SFP+ NICs and I'm trying to figure out how I can set up Proxmox to use the 10G NICs for all the connections it can, while using RJ45 for communication with APs, any other servers, and devices.
 My first idea was to make a bridge with just the SFP+ NICs, a bridge with that bridge and the RJ45 NICs, and then give that one to OPNsense. However, that would mean any RJ45 servers on the same network would all go through OPNsense when they're on the same VLAN which is unnecessary.
 What's the best way to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's also a rare series (Paddington Bear 1976).
 I lost the DVD a long time ago but retained the VIDEO_TS files, which I've since converted to mkv. The issue is, each file has an odd length at [25:56], but each episode is about 4-5 minutes long, causing some episodes to split between files. I don't know how it happened (I didn't convert the DVD) but I want to correct this. So my questions are:
  
Do we have any control over how the VIDEO_TS files are created? And if so, how does it work?
 If I had to manually edit the files and stitch the split ones together, what opensource software would be best? I use Windows 11...don't OS shame me please you Linux and Ubuntu users.

 ​
 As you can see, Cloudflare has the ability to put all dns queries under a secure tunnel to their servers.
 How do i do this by myself with dnsmasq? Do i just start my resolver after connecting to a vpn??
 Btw, Cloudflare has their own dns protocol named WARP that acts like a vpn and encrypts your traffic.

 My self-hosting has been always been completely LAN based, and a VPN for when I'm abroad.. After seeing a few posts stating "Got my complete lab behind SSO", it inspired me to set-up SSO with Authentik - So I've spent the past week rebuilding my K3S clusters (I run 3 of them) in preperation for this, adding in some of the missing pieces (Cert Manager etc).
 Anyway, I've just gone to begin utilisng it with the 3 mains apps I want remote access too, i.e. Plex, Emby and AudioBookShelf - Just to realise, none of them support OICD or SAML... The best I can do, is Emby with LDAP auth.
 I'd really like to understand, how others are approaching this?
 For clarity - I'm looking to put a common authentication mechanism for apps that I want to expose the the internet.. i.e. So I login in to Authentik once, and have access to what I need, I also avoid the need to manage multiple accounts across multiple apps..

The answer, "looks like six fibers but don't know the rating" wasn't a terrible answer, as these things go. And based on the stated dimensions of the reel and what I can see in the photo, it's at least a few hundred feet of cable. So what the heck, I placed a bid without doing the in-person inspection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm hoping I can get some guidance from anyone with experience with what I'm trying to achieve: send mail on behalf of my users without landing in the spam folder.
 Some months ago I made what now seems like a masochistic decision to create an email service. At the outset I knew that deliverability would be an issue but now, even with all appropriate records set up (DKIM, SPF, DMARC, PTR) and server configured correctly, messages are still go straight to spam (GMail).
 My mail server is hosted by DigitalOcean and I've learned that entire ranges of their IP addresses have been blacklisted. I've tried assigning different Reserved IPs to mail server but so far it's no help. One obvious option is to try moving the mail server to a different provider entirely, but I'm not sure which providers have good reputation AND are cost effective AND will allow sending. I'm open to suggestions on this.
 Another option I was considering is using a third-party for sending since the larger players tend to have excellent reputation. But I'm not sure if this can work for my service. With services like SendGrid and MailGun, domains and senders need to be validated. My service allows users to create multiple profiles (senders) — I alone have ~180 — so limits on such services would probably be reached very quickly. If sending from custom domains these services require adding DNS records, but this wouldn't be appropriate in my case as the records would have references to the third-party domains.
 What would be the best option to ensure email delivery?
 Any useful suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance.

 I don't use it that much atm. Just for backups. But in case I ever needed to use it more frequently for longer periods of time, the information would come in handy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Would you guys recommend DISCTECH for buying some Factory Refurbished hard drives? They seem legit, but I'm on the fence. I really like that they (supposedly) don't open the factory seal and re-test the drives like ServerPartDeals does. If the manufacturer just recertified a drive, I don't want a seller opening it and re-testing ya know?
 Edit: I'm starting to think it's probably better to get a "Manufacturer Recertified" drive than a "Factory Refurbished". Refurbished likely means it was a repaired drive that was bad, when a Recertified should indicate a returned/open box drive. Does this logic sound right?
 Any opinions are appreciated cause I trust y'all.
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 Factory Refurbished from DiscTech:
 https://www.disctech.com/Seagate-Exos-X16-ST16000NM001G-16GB-512e-SATA-Hard-Disk-Drive
 This is what they said when I asked about them testing it:

 Manufacturer Recertified from ServerPartDeals:

 Update: DO NOT buy from DiscTech's eBay store if you want their 1 year seller warranty. FYI

 This seems to validate the thoughts on Refurb vs Recertified

 I have scoured the internet for this and can't figure it out. Every guide on OAuth/OpenID with Authentik assumes I have full control of the application so I can setup the OpenID login on the other end. If I understand correctly, OpenID could be used on any site without any further configuration on my end, since I'm hosting an OpenID compatible server.

 How do you folks manage (unify?) multiple systems with multiple containers having access to NFS share? Lets say Lidarr is on Device A. It tells the NAS (Device B) to download a file. Lidarr then has to have read/write to the path on the NAS to move it. And now another container (Dev A2) or separate system (Device 3) needs access those files for playback?

I use this VM lab to do pen-testing, intrusion analysis, disk forensic analysis, and traffic analysis. I will eventually begin deploying live malware to observe and analyze, and I am also building an environment that simulates an enterprise network environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have been running my Unraid server for over a year now, with no knowledge going into it. I have learned a few things along the way with the help of guides, forums and reddit. 
 Today I setup a reverse proxy so my friends could use Overseerr without exposing my IP address. It isn't that I didn't trust my friends, but mainly because my IP address changes so often from my IP that I didn't like getting messages that "it's broken". But I do know it is bad practice to let people know what your IP is.
 This is the first taste I have setting up a reverse proxy, though I setup Wireguard with Duck DNS to be able to access my server outside the network in the past.
 I believed I setup everything correctly in Nginx and applied the SSL certificate to the domain that was created for Overseerr. The only issue that I am running into is through Chrome I get an warning, "Deceptive site ahead". Edge and Firefox does not show this warning. After some googling people generally say that it is a Duck DNS problem, and after using no-ip to create a domain, it does appear that way as I get no warning when using the no-ip domain to access Overseerr. I don't want to use no-ip as you have to renew the domain every 30 days and I don't think I can set it up to automatically update my IP address when it changes (this could be a lack of knowledge). 
 I was wondering if there is a way to fix this issue. Currently I have Overseerr, Duck DNS, and Nginx all as dockers inside my Unraid server. 
 Thank you in advance.

 ​
 Please allow me to introduce myself to the community.
 Hope you are having great end of 2022.
 ​
 I have moved to new place aiming to setup homelab at home for my career to playaround, learn, break, fix etc etc.
 ​
 I have telus 2.5g with pfSense and Unifi equipemnt.
 I ve been trying to follow these tutorials online.
 https://youtu.be/KVYcZNvq8os
 https://youtu.be/Omm2pQUJO0o
 ​
 I succeed in making Telus(ISP) modem to talk to pfSense.
 I am struggling to make UDM SE to talk to pfsense.
 I think I don't know what I am doing or video above assumes that I have existing knowledge and to follow the video.
 ​
 Currently, I have comptia A+ with limited knowledge about Networking. I am trying to learn and hopeing to get better understadning of networking.
 ​
 It seems like I need to create VLAN for both side of pfSense and UDM SE to make it talk since there is no such a thing as bridge mode in between.
 ​
 What am I doing wrong?
 ​
 Is there any cabling I need to improve?
 ​
 How do I turn off DHCP on UDM SE and let pfsense take full control of it?
 ​
 I am assuming that all the unifi device need to be re-adapted to network when it has internet?
 ​
 Please help, I know it's hot mass but any help much appreciated.
 ​
 Cheers,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I currently have an Unraid server, and if I am being honest, it meets most of my needs. I keep all my media / data on it, and run a few docker containers (Plex, radarr, sonarr). However, recently I have gotten myself worked up about data rot, and have decided I should really build a TrueNAS system with ZFS. 
 My thought is to build a low powered TrueNAS system that is just used for storage. I am thinking 6 8TB drives in a RAIDZ2 config. Then run a higher powered Proxmox system for my dockers and a few VM's. 
 Does this make the most sense? I know I can run docker with TrueNAS scale, but to be honest, I would rather just setup TrueNAS once and leave it alone. I know I can also run TrueNAS on a VM, but again, I don't think the idea of that.

 I need help choosing the best solution for storage. Either an external drive, something like the 8TB WD MyBook or getting an external HDD casing with a few hard drives inside it. Although the ones I found people complained about noise and overheating
 Anyone’s got some tips or recommendations regarding my choice?

 As it is now, everything is in a single docker-compose.yml file. Jellyfin, Navidrome, Audiobookshelf, Photoprism. Each of the services have a config file, and are given a folder in /config that only that service uses. 
 My thought was that I could make a folder in Home called "Apps", give each service a folder inside, and put the config folder next to the docker-compose.yml. This would allow me to only have to back up that "Apps". Probably with Syncthing. However, it would put everything in my home drive.
 Is there a best practice? Or anything else I'll need to consider?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I want to move my power consuming plex server to another machine, since it is running on a gaming machine right now. I was able to get a cheap Optiplex which seems to fit quite well for my use case. Problem I have now is, that I read, that the HBA cards are getting quite hot and in that Optiplex SFF won’t be to much space to provide proper cooling. At the beginning I was thinking of a new case (Nanoxia deep silence rev 6b to fit everything in one case), but with that Optiplex a case swap seems to be quite hard. Building the whole thing new from scratch would cost way more then use that Optiplex. Now I thought of getting a random tower put that HDDs in there connect them to a power supply and then link them to an LSI HBA 9200-16e which I would then plug into the Optiplex. Is the card going to be to hit then? Should I just leave the case of the Optiplex open and this will do the job? Or will it be better to just plug in USB Drives into the Optiplex?
 If building an external enclosure all I really need is that HBA card (it mode), a case, a usual power supply and the SAS to SATA cables, right? 
 Any other solution or ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[SSDs are typically not seen as a good choice for cold storage because unpowered drives gradually lose their data. Consumer drives seem to be spec'ed for 1 year anyway and that spec is based on a pretty heavily used drive.
 How would you "refresh the charge" on a cold stored drive though? Is it as simple as plugging it into a power source (for how long?) or does the data actually need to be re-written? Does this require an OS to perform the task or does the drive firmware just handle it when it happens to have power?
 With a lot of drives going to SMR and SSDs going down in price I can sort of see a lot of backup tasks (certainly not all) migrating over to SSDs soon. It isn't clear to me how to work around their limitations in this space.

 recently I started as a intern and I'm overwhelmed with my job because I'm a total noob in network technology. We have a product which is hosted externally. We only have a simple router here.
 The Services and the Reverse-Proxy should be running in Docker Containers on a Ubuntu machine. These services should be reachable with another devices on the local network via browser. I have read about resolving through Windows/Linux hosts.file but the examples I found are using only localhost. Is it possible to use this file for my constellation/usecase?
 Is it better to set up a DNS-Resolver? I think it could be problematic because everything in the office runs in one network. We are thinking of getting a firewall anyway and in case of need we would have an second old router to set 2 NATs but I'm afraid I won't have time to set everything up and trouble shoot because I have to do a long research again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After doing some searching and not seeing an answer to my problem I decided to just post here. EAC works fine upon installation, recognizing my cd drive, going through the whole setup, and ripping CDs. But as soon as I close the application and start it back up I can't do anything. There is no CD drive to select and I can't rip CDs. I have had to uninstall and reinstall every time that Ive found a new CD I want to rip.
 Is there some EAC option I am missing, or does EAC just not like my drive? For reference my the CD drive I have as detected by EAC on installation is a TSSTcorpCDDVDW SH-224BB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all I work with very large 3d files, and I have upgraded an 10 year old synology nas to an Asustor lockerstor 4 gen2 with a Netgear GS108E-300PES switch, with 4 ssd of 2tb and 4 hdd of 12tb in RAID, I still do not buy NIC, so I have access only in 2.5gb.
 I hope someone can guide me, I don't know much about networks, but I'm here to learn:
  
Which NIC (not too expensive) do you recommend to use NAS at 5gbps, I work animations and 3d?
 With the Link aggregation of the switch, can I make the two 2.5gbps connections go to one 5gbps or 10gbps connection? but I bought the netgear one (I can still return the switch if I need another one).
 I have also seen another QNAP QSW-M2108-2C switch, which I don't know if it is better.
  I have four computers all they have 2.5g lan. 
 1 Workstation, 1 Renderfarm, 2 laptops.
 
  
I would be interested in future proofing this investment and then being able to have 10gbps for my computers and servers.
 Thank you all in advance .
 Edit: I made a mistake in the post the switch I have is the Netgear MS510TX-100EUS that have ports of 1gb, 2.5gb 5gb and 10gb rj45 + sfp. Thanks for the response!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to host some things like gitea and maybe other services in the future (mainly for privacy reasons).
 I was wondering what will be better: getting a physical server like Lenovo ThinkCenter or renting a VPS.
 From back of the napkin calculations—for the cost of the Lenovo ThinkCenter I can rent a VPS for almost 9 years, and it's not taking into account hardware replacements and electricity.
 I can't find any other pros for the physical server rather than my unhealthy obsession to own things rather than rent them. Obviously my calculations are based on hosting gitea for now, any other self-hosted service will double the price of VPS (unless multiple services can be hosted on the same instance).
 Appreciate your input.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the past i used: - selfhosted openvpn with duckdns domain (forwarded ports) - selfhosted wireguard with duckdns domain (forwarded ports) - zerotier 
 I also have regular paid domain. My network is 500/30 Mbps (yes its 30 not 300)
 I need secure access to my NAS (Synology) from outside (and ONLY to NAS, not entire LAN). Currently i use Quickconnect but i want to use sync and SMB services and AFAIK QC is not secure enough for that.
 So i wonder what would be the best for me.
  
Tailscale/Zerotier - simplest but yet the slowest (?). Im reading this ... https://medium.com/netmaker/battle-of-the-vpns-which-one-is-fastest-speed-test-21ddc9cd50db
 
Sefhosted Wireguard - i set it up once, it should be faster. But is it relevant in my case since i have 500/30 internet? I mean those 30Mbps will limit the download speed anyway
 
Cloudhosted netmaker - more reliable than pt. 2 but easier. Also (theoretically) faster than 1. But I would have to get some cloud. Probably i would opt for Oracle Free Tier since AWS i only free for a year. But again, will speeds be so much better when my home internet is 500/30?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I'm starting to think that what I thought to be trivial might not be. 
 I'm looking for a service to do the following: 1. Automatically backup specific folders from 3 Android phones (photos, videos, documents) and from one Macbook. I want to be able to define which folders I want to backup. *so an Android app is really important. 2. The service will maintain the original structure, e.g. Phone 1 > Pictures > Camera. 3. To have the ability to determine who sees what. E.g. Phone 1 will only see Phone 1's data, Phone 2 only Phone 2, etc. 4. Nothing will be automatically downloaded to any device or synced between them (I don't want phone 1 data on Phone 2) 5. I will be able to access the data regularly (to view, download and share documents and pictures). 6. I'd like to rely on it to free up space on these mobile phones and potentially laptop. 7. If it's possible, I would also like to store some movies I downloaded over the years (some of them are old and harder to find, but if it's an issue with copyrights then I'll just store it offline) 8. Security and privacy, speed and pricing are important so outside US is better (I'm from EU). 9. I don't need more than 1TB for the upcoming years.
 I read too many (probably) paid reviews and on the other hand a lot of bad reviews, so I would love your help with figuring out what would be best for me.
 (Can't add more options to the poll)

 Any other service that is better than what's listed

 I am planning to go paperless with paperless-ngx. I already have a docker setup where I can run the software with, but I am struggeling to find the right printer. All the scanners, that are recommended on the paperless repo seem to be quite expensive.
 Do you have recommendations wich scanner/all-in-one-printer does the job and is affordable (also buying a used one is an option). Being able to use duplex scanning and being able to scan multi-page documents would be important to me because I want to automate the incoming document flow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So z-lib going down prompted me to finally start to build a proper archival storage, which went quickly from raspberry Pi + usb external drives to planning for a full-fledged NAS.
 I planned to find a motherboard with 8 SATA ports, mainly eyeing ATX boards from ASrock, MSI etc in the $100-200 range targeting desktop builds. But asking around, experienced friends mentioned two things, 1) LSI card IT mode is a thing, therefore SATA port count does not matter too much, 2) apparently supermicro and decommissioned server boards exist (average pulled-not-refurbed offerings were on the higher end of my budget; not going to get any of the beefy ones).
 I start to hesitate whether to get an average desktop board and grab a LSI, or find a previously owned sm board. Searching in the subreddit, it seems both have been done, but I didn't see opinions of choosing between the two, although points have been made about whether it's good to get second hand motherboards. 
 I am comfortable with using HPC servers and have done some VPS self hosting for fun, but this is my first time to build and maintain a physical server. I have had no experience of using LSI.
 Is there any pitfalls to turn me away from either options? Any thoughts are appreciated.

I use bare drives as offline backup, and SAS drives tend to be a bit cheaper and have generally spent life in a climate-controlled, steady state and often are recycled out far before the drive has any problems. I've successfully used SAS drives for backups and temp storage for years now, and so far have had zero failures other than the rare case of a drive that came with bad sectors or other problems (like the ones I'm talking about here) already.
 NetApp drives are known for coming with 520 byte sectors, but those can usually be reformatted to 512 byte sectors with some sg_format magic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For this Christmas i want to do a little upgrade to my node 804 mini server. Because of this, im limited to only micro atx boards, but also in the need of a lot of connectivity.
 CPU: AMD 5600X
 Desired setup:
  
2 x NVME directly on the board. Preferably both at PCI 4.0 for a little future proof, but wont mind if the second only runs at 3.0
 1 x PCI at x4 - x8 lanes, for my SAS Board (LSI 9207-8i) | Probably only need x4 with my 8 HDD's bandwidth.
 1 x PCI x1 for a basic GPU (GT 710 1 lane most likely). | Second small slot
 1 PCI x4, for a 10Gbps PCI Board, last slot.
  
Drive quantity:
  
8 x HDD: Directly to the SAS Board.
 2 x NVME M.2 in the motherboard.
 2 to 4 Sata SSD. Directly to the MB.
  
So the Asrock PRO4 seems like a good option for this, but cots almost 250 USD.
 I think a cheaper one like the Aorus B550M could work (150USD), according to the specs... but i have been burned before with an AM4 board disabling SATA ports while using some of the PCI links, with said info buried a little in the user manual... so just trying to avoid the same mistake.
 Thanks a lot for any guidance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I actually was looking for a way to download rumble videos, not necessarily YouTube. 
 I found a YouTube video showing how to download rumble videos ( here ) and the guy used a website called davapps. 
 I’m asking Reddit if this site is legit because I’m not a big tech guy and it seems almost too good to be true lol. I literally just copy-pasted the url and downloaded the video, it took 20 seconds. I went to the website, pasted the link, and boom downloaded. 
 I didn’t have to download any software, or spend hours researching about some long ass complicated process, none of that. Just website - paste link- boom downloaded to my computer. It’s so simple and easy I’m wondering if there’s some nefarious catch, or if it’s totally legit. 
 I can’t find any posts about anyone using this website, everyone just uses YouTube dl or has some super long complicated process. 
 Has anyone used Davapps to download videos?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there-
 I recently set up a VPS to host a database and a python scraper. I route all requests through a paid proxy that rotates through IPs to ensure my scrape requests don't get blocked/throttled. Currently scraping a mixture of Amazon & Google pages, but want to potentially expand.
 Now that I've finished configuring all of that, I started thinking about attempting to host my own proxy service instead of using a paid one. Here are some of my thoughts:
  
Starting to get close to monthly data caps on current proxy plan
 I've used SQUID in the past, so that part isn't daunting to me, also read that it can be configured to rotate through IPs.
 I love technology and typically self-host whenever I can.
 Guessing this could be cheaper and/or more flexible?
  
I do have a few questions though -- 
  
I'm guessing I'd need a VPS with 5+ ip addresses. Which VPS providers allow that and have cheap plans? 
 Any idea how many IPs I would need for something like this?
 
 Is setting up my own proxy service worth it? Can it be cheaper?
  
Looking forward to hearing others' thoughts/advice. Thank you for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - I have Guacamole running in docker - pretty much just as laid out in their docs. It was 1.2.1 and I upgraded it to 1.4.0 just by pulling the new images and ran those. Everything seemed to work fine, but being rather new to docker, I was wondering if the SQL schema upgrade happens automatically? I thought you had to upgrade the database before running the new images, but for the life of me, could not find definitive info through my Google-Fu (which may be weak). Even the 2FA java plugin just worked fine. 
 I looked through the docker logs of both new containers, but didn't see anything where any schema upgrade scripts were run. So, just wondering before I do the same to my production containers if this is how it is done.
 Thanks - appreciate the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: Is it possible to create a backup image of a cloud server so I can use the image to re-run the server on a local physical computer on my network?
 Some years ago, I bought a cloud server from a local company for 3$ a month and installed Wordpress with some of their automated scripts to build a small shop. 
 I'm not using the shop that much anymore and I thought of turning it off, but I don't want to lose that data just in case in the future I want to reuse it again. The thing is that the company charges for storage used even if the server is turned off.
 So I was wondering what could I use to make an entire backup of the whole server and copy it to my computer? 
 Ideally it would be great if I could make some kind of whole-computer-backup or something that allows me to kind of create an "image" or something and in the future re-install the image in another computer and have exactly the server as it was (but on my local network for example). 
 The thing is, since it's a cloud server, I don't know if that's even possible?
 Thanks in advance for your help

 I have all containers tied to a custom network, docker_prod, so I am able to use container names in NPM rather than relying on changing port numbers. This works fine for just launching the apps from NPM, but seems to cause issues w/ Authentik.
 I followed this tutorial to setup Authentik and I was able to get it working the first time, but haven't had luck since. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, but I seem to flip flop between 500 and 502 errors.
 I've looked up and down for more documentation, or youtube tutorials, but it doesn't seem like other folks are running into this same issue.
 I also do not understand the terminology despite reading the instruction - provider? outpost?
 My need is (hopefully) simple - I'd like to add authentication in front of applications that do not have it natively built in. As a future step, I'll integrate 2FA via Google Auth.
 Can someone ELI5? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering upgrading my server from it's current setup (an old Macbook Pro and a 5th gen NUC) to an 8th gen Proliant Microserver. I really like the form factor of the Proliant and am not sure I have the space for a rack server. I'm just not sure a maxed out Proliant will be sufficient upgrade from my current setup. Current specs:
 Macbook (running Arch): - i7-3720QM @ 2.60GHz 4 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 5681 - 16 GB RAM
 NUC: - i5-5250U @ 1.60GHz 2 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 2493 - 4 GB RAM
 A maxed out Proliant would have the following specs:
 HPE Proliant Microserver 8th Gen (maxed out): - Xeon E3-1290 v2 @ 3.7 GHz 4 cores, 8 threads - Passmark score: 6470 - 16 GB RAM
 I'm not sure that it's worth replacing my two current machines with this one machine. I'd really like to get a Xeon with at least 12 threads but I think I'll either need to go rack mount or a standard tower (or build my own). The Macbook handles the heavier workloads (Frigate, Nextcloud, and a Mac VM).
 I'm kinda just basing my estimations on Passmark scores but I know that doesn't tell the full story. What are your guys' thoughts? Would this upgrade be worth it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently in the process of switching my home server from a Raspberry Pi 4 to a 2012 Mac Mini, and am not sure how to go about it. My reason for switching is primarily ease of use - I've spent so long dealing with user permissions, complicated docker setups, and general linux idiosyncrasies, and really just want to switch to something more plug-and-play. 
 As it stands, my server is running 4 1TB ext4 hard drives on OMV 5 that I want to move over to the mac mini. I know that mac has limited ext4 support, but I'd prefer to run the drives in a mac-native (still cross-platform) file system. 
 So my questions are:
  
What filesystem would work best in this case? I have heard good things about exfat, and it seems like a good cross-platform option. I am also open to APFS.
 How best can I go about migrating my data onto the new filesystem? Is there a tool that can do this?
 As a last resort (I really don't like the redundancy of running 2 systems at once) I have considered keeping the pi as an OMV-based storage server, and just having the mac mounted to the drives.
  
Thanks!

I want to travel overseas for about 4-5 weeks to oversee a different project of my own (construction related). The problem I am having is that even though I asked my supervisor he wouldn't agree to let me travel abroad.
 I have been trying to find a way to set up an openvpn server at home, preferably something not too complicated. I need to be able show my home IP address and it has to be a standalone device that I can simply plug to my router. Also, I cannot use a VPN as pretty much all VPN IP's are blacklisted by my company and I automatically receive a warning message.
 I could setup an unattended computer with teamviewer/anydesk but I am looking for something more reliable. A friend suggested to buy a Mikrotik router and plug it in my home router as there is an option to create an openvpn server. After some research I found out that some other routers have the same option as well. Pfsense seemed like a decent idea too. However, the problem I am having is that my home router changes it's IP address every 1-2 weeks or so. I asked my ISP for a static IP but that feature is only for business customers. Any ideas on how to get around that?

 I travel for work and want the ability to access my Home lab on the road. I understand SSH and VPNs and am running both OpenVPN and Wireguard. However my company says that I cannot install any client VPN software on my work laptop. (Intel 13" MacBook Pro)
 Ideally I would like remote CLI and web access, but could live with the latter only. I have two solution ideas.
  
Bring another tablet or laptop that does run VPN software (Heavy!)
 Bring an external router like a glinet device that can transparently provide VPN access (Less heavy but more annoying)
  
Does anyone else have any other suggestions on how to tackle this? I would even be okay with some kind of VPN that runs only in a browser.
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm spinning my wheels deciding how I want to accomplish some local name resolution. I'm not the strongest on networking stuff and I'm pretty sure I have several viable solutions in mind but I'm trying to figure out which will be the easiest to implement.
 I'm running a combined router/firewall/DNS/DHCP/reverse proxy all on an OPNsense instance on proxmox. My goal is to get simple URLs to point towards all of the services. My defined domain in OPNsense is we'll say "home.laxweasel" and the goal is to get my different services on tidy subdomained urls.
 I assume the best way to do this is to have a domain record in my DNS for home.laxweasel that points to my OPNsense IP, and then put all my services reverse proxied into Caddy. Then from there I'd need to set up every host with at minimum a static DHCP lease to ensure I don't beak my Caddyfile every reboot.
 However, I was also poking around and saw DHCP registration in Unbound, so that hostnames would automatically set up in unbound. In that case, all I would have to do is use the reverse proxy for things using a nonstandard port to access. That would also make it completely unnecessary to make static DHCP leases by hand for all my hosts.
 Thoughts/experiences? Anyone want to point me in a good direction?

 So I will be starting with 3x LG WH16NS40 drives and that is where I have come to a road block. Should I buy one of these, gut it and modify it to install a motherboard? Go with a tower and mount them? Or do I pick up a small used pc (m70 etc) and use these? So many difficult decisions...
 How much raw power do you think I will need? I am not worried about how long things take since it will sit somewhere out of the way and do its thing (probably headless).

 Hey, long time lurker here.
 I've been messing around with proxmox and networking for quite a bit on the side of my studies on my old desktop computer. I have been dreaming of setting up a system like this one for quite some time and decided to draw it out and ask this community for any recommendations on upgrades to achieve this, tips on starting a first proper homelab, or just overall thoughts on my setup. 
 Any and all discussions are welcomed. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a complete noob, I referred to this to install wget and this reddit post to try and download the images (for each separate perfume) from the Harrods UK website.
 I tried the following in the Windows command line:
 C:\wgetdown>wget -r -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png -e robots=off https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/shopping/beauty-perfume 
 which returned the following error:
  
OpenSSL: error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure
 Unable to establish SSL connection.
  
and then replaced https with http:
 C:\wgetdown>wget -r -A jpeg,jpg,bmp,gif,png -e robots=off http://www.harrods.com/en-gb/shopping/beauty-perfume 
 which returned the same error.
 I am sure there's something I am missing, any help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm setting up a home server rack with equipment (POE-enabled switch, router, NAS, two USFF PCs) drawing ~600w of power.
 I'm looking for a reliable rack-mounted power-conditioning PDU with surge protection and was initially thinking about a UPS. The $500+ UPSes I'm seeing are a little too rich for my blood, especially since I care less / not at all about the UPS' uptime benefits and primarily about protection benefits from a PDU and surge protector.
 This is for a home network -- I'm a tinkerer, not a network engineer looking to replicate an enterprise environment.
 Two questions -
  
Am I thinking about this the right way?
 Is there a reliable < $200 power-conditioner PDU + surge protection solution without UPS folks would recommend that would meet my needs?

 Lets say i got a server with 24 internal disks (where all the data is stored that needs to be accessible 24/7) and a jbod thats just used for backups for like 1 or 2 hours every couple days (two separate zfs pools).
 How is truenas going to behave if the jbod is powered off and when needed powered on again?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all i have researched a lot and i cant seem to find the right choice for this, i’m very aware of NAS adapters and NAS enclosures but the options are always focused on having only one specific drive attached.
 I think the best way to get an advice for this is to just detailing what i have and i want.
 What i have? - 3 external hdd (4tb WD easy storage, 2tb seagate, 1tb wd my passport) the first one has a power cable and usb cable to be able to connect to my pc, the others only use an usb cable.
 What i want? Access to all the data stored on those hdd’s via my pc or my phone (i want to watch videos stored on those hdd’s without having to connect them to my pc first)
 So basically a personal cloud made of a bunch of hdd external drives.
 I’m sorry if i explain everything like a child but is just that i’m very noob at this kind of things

 I have downloaded some videos from Panopto. Unfortunately, they are split between audio and video files; all files are MP4.
 Do you know of any simple application to use to join and sync the audio and the video? I have tried OpenShot but it freezes up.
 Would it be easier to convert the audio in MP4 to MP3 before joining them?

 There are many NAS options out there, but I don't want RAID or JBOD or any NAS operating system. I want to have each drive in the enclosure as a separate drive in Windows, like they are now.
 Technically, the enclosure should only include a power adapter, some coolers and a USB hub. Does something like this exist?

 For months, I've been looking for an open source travel tracker. I'm looking for something like Polar steps.
 For this I could use whether my mobile phone or a gps tracker to send my GPS position to some third party. Then I need that this third party has an public API then I can get my data.
 Have you ever heard about an gps tracker with an public API ? Or a similar project ?
 Links : - https://www.polarsteps.com/
 Thank you :)
 Edit : This is the closest tag I found, excuse me if it's not the right one

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am a Matt, a developer of ExpressACC, which is a ‘Family’ Time Tracking system, and hopefully an added Task Management system in the future, that I created for my kids. This allows them to be able to track their time left for the day that they can have on their devices/screens.
 Backstory: We have many devices through the house including TVs, Consoles, Phones, Tablets, etc… There are many built-in device tools (like iOS Screen Time), but they don’t take into account devices outside their ecosystem. This meant that I had to regulate their times individually, and we can have up-to 5 children at a time from 7 to 14 years old at home. This is when I decided to come up with a simple time tracking app, and they love it more than me telling them it’s time to get off their devices. T…]]></summary>

 In July, I bought 25GB Verbatim M Discs from Amazon. Even though I bought them directly from Amazon Europe, the discs I received were not real M Discs but regular Verbatim BD-Rs with an organic layer that were made to look like M Discs. I noticed right away because the MID of the discs was VERBAT-IMe-000, which is the code for their regular BD-Rs, instead of MILLEN-MR1-000 which is the MID that all 25GB M Discs have. At this point I assumed I'd been sold fakes, but 3 months later I again ordered Verbatim M Discs, this time from German retail chain Saturn, and once again received these discs that I assumed are fakes. I emailed Verbatim's customer service a…]]></summary>

 ​
 I am product repping for a small company and would like to track what samples I have, and when I send samples to customers. I would also like an easy way for customers to place orders, and then for both the customer and me to be able to track the order status, including tracking shipping.
 ​
 Helpdesk & Ticketing system as well as email management would be a nice bonus, but are not required.
 ​
 Does this product exist? Or do I need to build it myself? I would be happy to open-source it if it is something I need to develop, and would appreciate any help people were willing to give.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use Traefik as my reverse proxy and really find that once setup it is super powerful, but I found a few issues with the direct docker integration so created a tool to try make it simpler for me, and think it may make life easier for others.
 https://github.com/qwacko/traefik-config-gen
 The key issues I wanted had were:
  
Integration with docker containers on other hosts requires docker swarm.
 I felt that I was forever creating the same 8-10 labels on every container to make them work (but having to rename a bunch and hopefully make no errors).
  
Possibly there are different ways to solve these issued, but I created a tool that effectively hooks into the HTTP Provider that Traefik provides, and reads docker labels to generate a configuration based on a user defined template for Traefik to use. 
 This doesn't make the setup of Traefik any easier (you need a working system in order for this to work), but once setup, this should save a bunch of time keeping every new container functioning correctly and consistently no matter which host you add it to. I have found having this new way of working functioning means that for non-docker services, it is easier to run an almost empty container with the suitable labels to include it into traefik than to delve into the file config.
 This is the first time I have made something and put the effort into actually sharing it, and I learnt alot about how to do things like auto-build etc.. but also learnt the difference in effort between hacking together a script that works for me and creating something that others might actually be able to use (and documenting as such) Happy for any advice on how to improve what I have pulled together, as I have a few other items that I may end up releasing publically as well.

 I'd like to know if there is a way i can backup this system so that i can "easily" restore it to a working state.. I'm talking accounts, passwords, services, data.. the whole shebang...
 I consider myself fairly literate when it comes to linux but i'm by no means an expert.. I run proxmox in several locations and am more than happy with snapshots / backups in that arena.. but when it comes to a baremetal restore i'm lost..
 I understand i'd need to at a minimum reinstall the bare OS.. but is there some way i can then restore things to how it was at my last backup?

However, I have also heard that even when not used, hard drives can "rot" or rust, leading to the information inside being at risk of being destroyed.

 I really like NextCloud. When I decided to use my NAS for actual self-hosting, NC was the first service I spun up, back then as snap image because I had no idea how containers worked and it was the easiest way. Once I graduted to docker, NC was among the first services I spun up, again. I'm using the stable branch and it has been rock-solid so far. NC apps made it extremely easy to try new things and I discovered many useful services to self-host which I would never even have attempted otherwise. Thanks to NC, I did use at some point, at least temporarily:

 I'm searching for an online backup solution. All these 'lifetime' packages kinda freak me out since lifetime is usually defined by the lifetime of the product and nothing else.
 To explain further my 'sidehustle' is photography and well, it takes up a lot of space. Currently I'm using backblaze to backup my stuff, but I hate the retrival they offer and the fact that the service works kinda slow (my line is 3/3gbit and the upload never goes over 150mbit).
 So I'm currently trying out iDrive (since it was dirt cheap like 4eur / year for 10TB). Works fine for the price, the file retrival is better, but they don't offer sufficient storage capacity for me.
 Any other services out there that will not break the bank and will work?
 Thanks!
 Edit: Currently I need 60TB of storage

 TLDR. I have a site running on an old CMS(MySQL, PHP) I want to turn it into static HTML, CSS.
 I have a website running on an old very niche CMS that is no longer maintained. I want to self host the contents but don't need the dynamic features and I don't want to deal with trying to maintain PHP and MySQL services. So I want to convert it static HTML and CSS. 
 I'm looking for recommendations on tools to do the conversion. Tools that run on Windows are preferred.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/selfhosted !
 Recently I have gotten into archival, and wanted to tart archiving lots of science and tech magazines.
 Currently I use calibre-web to organize them as follows:
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/zfokxfsfglz91.png?width=2533&format=png&auto=webp&s=04aabc50224958c08b6938f0758c9c152543480f
 However there are a few problems with this method.
 1: Since they are PDFs, my download managers will flag them on desktop breaking the web reader.
 2: There is no way to read the PDFs on my phone for some reason. I can't import them into the books app without a PC and that ruins half the point.
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions or alternatives please let me know, and have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! This is my first post here and I'm looking for some general advice, so sorry if this post is a little bit long and not to the point.
 I have a small Linux server that I use for hosting various websites and projects. It currently is using a 1 TB SATA SSD. My parents have a mess of a lot of moderately important not backed up files spread over multiple laptop disks and external drives (one of which failed without a backup...), so I'd like to upgrade the server with more proper storage and set up NextCloud to get everything consolidated into one place with some redundancy.
 I know that buying used hard drives is a bad idea, but after looking on eBay I am considering buy two $40 4 TB Seagate disks. I don't know much about RAID, but it seems like mirroring everything across both disks with RAID 1 would be the right way to go, since that would ease some of the worries of the used drives failing? Is this a good idea?
 Is it also worth looking into other file systems? I just use normal ext4, but I've heard people talk about using ZFS instead, but I don't know much about it.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I HAD pihole setup on a raspberry pi with tailscale and magicDNS directed to it. When it logged ip’s it would log both the local ip’s (192.169.x.x) when connected via wifi w/o tailscale enable and tailscale ip’s (100.x.x.x) on cellular w/ tailscale running. 
 I’ve since switched my pihole to docker on synology using the synology’s ip (not macvlan). Pihole is registering local up’s but it seems like the tailscale queries from multiple devices are registering as “localhost” (127.0.0.1). 
 Can I change this or do I have to deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am creating a small website for my business. It will have very low traffic (likely <100 visits per month), I will probably like to build it with Wordpress or something similar with moving to html/css/js later down the road. It really just is a page displaying content about my business. Nothing fancy.
 ​
 1). Should I host my website within a VM (on my local pc) or is there really no point / no security risk? Assuming that I only allow http(s) connections, there isn't much room for security concerns right?
 2). What software do yall recommend for hosting? Reading the guides on this sub, I can't really decide between them, nothing stands out. I'm leaning towards apache because there seems to be quite a few YouTube guides for it and seems well documented.
 3). Is there anything I should know before getting into this? I'm working as a sysadmin so if theres anything technical I should know, or certain software that is common in production, anything is helpful!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing a little research on attempting to accomplish deploying a FOG server for backing up my OS installs (I distro hop quite a bit) so I can redeploy them easily if wanted. My environment is setup like this. I use Proxmox VE and have an AdGuard Home server deployed on it. My AGH server is my DHCP server as well. What I would like to do (or thinking what would be the route to take) is setup another interface on my PVE server for PXE booting and attach that and my LAN interface to my FOG server that I will build on my PVE server. Just not sure how to go about it and have PXE requests pull IPs from the FOG server and all other DHCP requests pull from AGH. Or is that even possible? Completely new to this and just playing it out in my head right now of how I see it working. Or, where and how to I configure AGH to work with the FOG server in that my nodes will be able to PXE boot to the FOG server without breaking normal DHCP functionality for normal operations. 
 Thanks in advance for any and all direction on how to accomplish this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Script Server by bugy is an absolute godsend.
 In a nutshell, it's a web interface to run scripts. You can add oAuth/LDAP, divide users into groups, and then allow them to run a python/shell/whatever script from the browser. It allows file and image output, takes file upload, and if you know Vue (or can figure it out) is actually quite extensible. I have never used Vue before, so I'm not saying easily (did not have fun figuring out adding a typescript loader to support newer modules), but it's doable, and probably easy for those that know how.
 Any time someone asks me to run a script/do the magic thing for them, they can now do it themselves. Even non technical users. No more waiting for them, no more spending time to do it for me (it's on the link mate, do it yourself), just an easy to understand interface (that's also easy to add scripts to).
 I'm seriously considering implementing this at work for the non-tech users who ask me for various script based outputs - I can lock it down to our Google oAuth organisation, and it gives outputs that Rundeck can't. It'd save me hours per day.
 TLDR, if you need a thing to run some scripts from a web interface and don't want to code your own, check this out. Bugy, if you're on here, if I've missed it on your repo, let me know how I can buy you a pint. Once I overcome the trauma of resolving webpack dependencies for the first time, I'll even try and make a pull request to support newer modules that rely on typescript, promise

How can I make it so that any machine connecting to say $my-domain:1234/service gets served by the service listening on port 9090?
 I know I CANT set location /service to proxy_pass to http://127.0.0.1:9090 because 127.0.0.1 here refers to the pod running nginx (in particular, it isnt running the service I want to connect to). 
 I thus tried to proxy_pass to http://$host-local-ip:9090 where $host-local-ip is something like 192.168.x.x, but now when I try to connect from a machine (call it A) outside the network, it seems nginx tries to service the requests from 192.168.x.x on the same network as machine A. Is there a way to fix this?

 I did install netdata but I am iffy about it.
 Things I wish to keep an eye on: - ZFS pool health - Physical hard disk failures - Filesystem errors (btrfs, zfs) - Snapraid-btrfs monitoring - Cronjobs monitoring - Disk spin-up / spin down (total time asleep vs. on). I run 'hd-idle' tool and there are log entries in syslog that I could use I guess to graph something?
 My notification preferences is Pushover, or at worst e-mail but open to a tool that does something else. Primarily I wanted to keep things very simple (zabbix is an example of a complex beast I am trying to avoid).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a single home server running all of my Docker services that is only accessible via LAN/VPN. I'm interested in high availability in case my server, internet, or power go down. I travel often to two other locations where I can place servers. How difficult is this to set up, and what do I need to learn?
 Do the servers need to have the same hardware, or can I mix and match across Linux servers and Raspberry Pis? 
 Docker Swarm seems dead. Kubernetes seems too complicated. Is Nomad the right orchestration tool for bringing this all together?
 Sounds like I will also need WireGuard/Tailscale so that all of the servers can communicate from different networks since I do not want them exposed to the public internet. 
 What else am I missing?

 but for scanner I'm stuck. I know there's SANE, but it seems to require the scanner to be connected over USB and not Wi-Fi. any way to use make it CUPS-like for scanner? like I have drivers and stuff installed on my server and clients just connect to server for scanning?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi is a very capable board. And has a lot of community behind it . But, sadly, It's hugely overpriced. The top model easily going for 200€.
 So what options do you have? ODROID,Rock-pi,Nanopi, others offer lines of ARM boards that outperform the raspberry easily at half the price or less. This is the option I would go if I wanted to have a small ARM low power and low price computer. Easy to get one for you for about 70-100€ .
 But the hardware support is poor, every SoC requiring special firmware to boot. I find that Archlinux ARM has done the best at supporting the most SoCs in an easy to prepare way, if anyone is interested :
 https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms
 Or you could go back to X86.
 Mini PCs based on X86 go from 130-200€ . Depending on factors. That's raspberry pi pricing, for something that is orders of magnitude faster. Particularly interesting because pricing are the N5105 ones.
 You have tinkering boards like the ODROID-H3, which can even power two SATA disks and an NVME drive, 2.5G two ports networking, but sadly based on Realtek. Also, RAM is not included.
 Even more interesting to me, which wanted to make a powerful home router, are this Chinese off brand models which you can easily get by searching for "pfsense router".

 This one comes with a 4 port i225 NIC, a much higher quality one than the original realtek one. Particularly if you want to use it for FreeBSD. And with RAM and storage included is overall cheaper. No SATA ports though. 
 What it does Include is a SIM slot, which can be very helpful for somebody wanting to configure a backup network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to repurpose an old TV box I have lying around into a homeserver, as a way to play around, get started into self hosting and be able to familiazire myself with concepts, etc.
 I am having an issue with Docker though, where I get the following error every time I run sudo docker run for any container (even hello-world):
 bash docker: Error response from daemon: failed to create shim task: OCI runtime failed: runc create failed: cgroup namespaces aren't enabled in the kernel: unknown. ERRO[0001] error waiting for container: context canceled 
 I believe the issue happens because I am, for compatibility reasons, using an old kernel 4.4.194 that does not support Cgroup V2.
 Is there a way to tell docker to switch to Cgroups V1? If not, os there anything else I can do to be able to get docker working on the machine? The homeserver will not be exposed to the internet, and security is not a priority.
 OS: Armbian 22.08.4 Bullseye

I want to have a "screensaver" type website showing random videos that I can have in the background while I exercise. Optionally, I'd like to jump through random videos in 30 second snippets. Kind of like the old school Winamp visualizers, but with videos I downloaded (like gaming speedruns and random 3D stuff).
 Is there a self hosted app for this? I use Plex and Jellyfin, but those aren't really suited for this. The research I did brought up some live streaming software, which is not the goal, though I guess I can hack together a script or something in conjunction with one of those. 
 Why I'm not just using VLC media player: Because this approach is more interesting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I've been attempting to build myself a homelab, with a proper server, alongside my TL-SG108E, Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) and Pi Zero v1.3.
 I recently came across this server on Facebook Marketplace (for 200 EUR):
  
HP ProLiant DL360p Gen 8 
 2x Xeon E5-2630 (6c/12t per CPU) @ 2.3 GHz
 64 GB ECC RAM
 Quad 1 GB NIC
 Raid Controller (changed to HBA) - 120 GB SSD + 2x 300 GB 10K SAS
 
  
I had a friend tell me that they wouldn't get this stating that its a Gen 8 the processor, the specs, and RAM are low. But the issue is I am on a budget for a server (so I can create projects, AD environment, etc. (for testing, as I work in security)). I am wondering if the server is worth the price for a beginner/first server. I plan to run Proxmox and spin up pfSense and other stuff that might help with network segmentation, etc.
 Additionally, the seller offered to install a clean version of Windows Server 2016 and give me remote RDP access and ILO access to check the specs out. I plan on using Hard Disk Sentinel to get an idea about the disks' state and health, but what else should I do to make sure the server is solid (without defects, etc.) before purchase?
 I'd sincerely appreciate any help.
 Thanks!

 Sometimes when I mount them, they mount as \\\\.\\TAPE0 and \\\\.\\TAPE1 and sometimes they mount as \\\\.\\TAPE1 and \\\\.\\TAPE2. 
 They're both on Fiber Channel, on SCSI 5/0.0.0 and 6/0.0.0. I thought it's supposed to be that the lower SCSI ID should be TAPE0 (or the lower path), but that doesn't happen either. Either 5/0.0.0 or 6/0.0.0 can mount as TAPE0, TAPE1 or TAPE2.
 I can see no pattern to why they mount one way or the other. 
 The issue is, if there are two tapes in there, I don't know which drive has which tape. So I have to spin up a tape and then go look on StoreEver Command View to see which drive goes active, and I can't reliably automate anything.
 Is there any way to predict or control this?

I'm not well-versed in the details of what features are beneficial for my need though - I don't need hardware RAID, but does caching help with access speed? Is there any other model (possibly more modern?) that's worth looking into?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a Oracle DC-24C shelf which I understand is very similar that the Netapp DS4246. 
 I read in another thread that swapping the power supply by a DELTA TDPS-580BB A 580W would result in less noise (and power consumption).
 So, I got the power supplies, but they ramp up to max fan speed all the time (I only have 4 HDDs installed). That is very noisy (~80dB@1m).
 The original power supplies ramp up to max at start up and then they slow down *a lot*. Resulting in about 45 dB@1m.
 I read in another thread that "It is possible to update the PCMs with less aggressive fan speed profiles. The IOMs have their own copy which they push to the PCMs on power up."
 So, any ideas? 
 Thanks!

Unfortunately, I did not research the device well enough and found its software is stuck behind a paywall. Being new to this device I am checking to see if anyone has a way to reconfigure the box to just be a stand alone disk shelf for home lab/backups. 
 ​
 Model# NAJ-1501
 12x 1.8TB SAS drives
 Dual controllers preinstalled
 All needed connector cables for the controllers
 If any additional information is needed about the box let me know, again first time posting here and first time using this type of device. 
 ​
 Any help is appropriated and if the answer is nope that's fine as well, just need to know if this is a brick to toss or not.

 ​
 Any suggestions for reasonable prices? I know it's all subjective of course, but I want to find something reasonable and of course I have to get the data uploaded/online. I have 1g/30mb so uploads mostly suck more than just basics. Also, I would say I have a moderate need to be able to access the files. Some drives I access daily, others weekly, still others seldom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just searched this sub for options on verifying backups and nearly all of them are a script or tool that the person runs manually, and nearly all of them assume network-share level access to the data.
 I'm exploring using services like Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2 for an off-site portion of my backup strategy. There is a "free tier" of free "transactions" (like executing an upload or download) and then you get charged for further calls. Additionally, ease of access to these tools often means implementing their API.
 Does anyone know of a tool, script, application on GitHub, or whatever that maybe does some or all of the following?
  
Runs periodically - once a day? Week?
 Provides some sort of report - an email would be nice. Or a dashboard? Something.
 Randomly selects a subset of files. If I have 5000 files, maybe it randomly picks 1%, or 50 of them.
 Uses a cloud-service API to download or run checks against the hosted files. Bonus points for supporting multiple services.
 Does a checksum or some other means to verify the integrity.
  
I think going for a random, small subset of files introduces some risk, but I can tolerate that risk.

 Today sadly my WD RED 4TB drive failed. I got noticed by NAS. I thought that there might be sth minor, but when I got home I checked again and it really died.
 I check the warranty and it expired on October, 22nd.
 That's my 2nd WD Red which failed shortly after the warranty expired. The first one was 3TB WD RED.
 So, I'm thinking to switch into Seagate Ironwolf. Thoughts? Maybe 6TB.
 EDIT:
 I have a Synology DS218+. 2x 4TB WD RED drives were bought in late summer 2019.
 I uploaded some images. Do you see them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large refurbished Dell server 3.5 inch hard drive, but a problem finding USB enclosures for it. Some of my docks don't seem to have enough power to run it, as the drive randomly shuts down (this is especially apparent in my hot swap dock, where with the enterprise drive running, if I try to plug in a drive in the other slot, the entire device turns off and restarts as the new drive tries to spin up). I know it's a problem with the enclosure because the drive works fine as an internal drive running off a normal computer SATA power cable. Another problem is that some of my enclosures sleep the drive, which I don't want as, one, the drive is heavy as hell with four platters and takes a long time to spin up and shut down, but also because with my intended workload as a file and web server, the timing of drive accesses is such that it will get a read or write, spin up, the get nothing for a while, go to sleep, then get another read or write a minute later, which wears out the drive much faster than if it was just constantly spinning.
 Has anyone had experiences with powering refurbished server drives with USB enclosures? Can anyone recommend a good model with both enough power and never sleeps the drive?

 I am running it inside a vm with 8vcore and 16g ram and resource usage is under 5% according to htop. Network should also be more than enough. 
 Is this normal? Are the videos out of the box directly streamed from yt or over proxy/tor?

 I have my sub domain names pointing to duckdns, which points to my home ip address to nginx proxy manager, which then points to the appropriate docker.
 I have the stock ISP router CODA 4582.
 It's just annoying to jump from ip address to domain name depending on if I'm home or not.

 I'll maybe use these drives as my use copy and buy a new big one as back-up.

I currently have 2 WD 16 TB hard drives hooked up to the two USB ports of an Nvidia Shield Pro, which houses a Plex Media Server that uses the hard drives as a library (although I use Kodi to play because Plex sucks on this platform for some reason). 
 I am trying to build a really simple NAS that can house 8-10 sata drives (ironwolf pro or exos) and maybe have a RAID setup. The Nvidia will do the heavy lifting as far as streaming and transcoding. So I could use some help looking at hardware. 
 I think the motherboard seems like the best place to start, then find the right CPU. What are some solid, cheap motherboards with a good amt of SATA ports (8+)? What form factor should I be looking for? I think I want to go with AMD since it seems cheaper and I don't need a ton of power. Any other advice that will help me future proof this setup is greatly appreciated!

 Recently moved into my first home and wired it with CAT6 cable. I'm finally done with consumer-grade routers and devices that need to be reset every couple of weeks. It's not much and I don't really know what I'm doing but it's been my favorite home project so far.
 Next I'll need to find a short NAS like the RS1221+ to use for storage and as a media server (recommendations welcome) and after that I'll look into building a box to run VMs... I can see myself sinking what's left of my disposable income into this stuff for a couple of months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi y'all,
 I work for a small business and we do regular print jobs for agents who we (the office admins) then charge at the end of the month. We've always kept a little paper binder to record the print jobs, quantity, what it's for, who it's for, and the cost per page, etc. I was wondering if there was some sort of open source self-hosted software for print logging/tracking/management or whatever you call it. 
 I'd like to have the ability for admins to filter by agent or job and then print a report at the end of the month to charge them, so we don't have to add it up ourselves by the end of the month. I'd also like to have it specify who it's for, who the log was recorded by, basically exactly what our booklet does. Is there something like that out there? Would I be better off just making some sort of sort of shared spreadsheet lol?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was previously running Nginx in a Docker container before. The Nginx container, as well as the rest of my other containers, all shared a Docker network called common. Every container (besides Nginx) used to expose their ports using the expose feature, rather than publishing them to localhost like 127.0.0.1:5000:5000.
 Stuff worked fine before, as long as I had a specific line in my Nginx configuation: resolver 127.0.0.11.
 However that isn't working anymore and I'm not sure how to reverse proxy my containers anymore (outside of ditching Docker's expose for it's publish/ports feature instead).
 This is what I've tried so far:
 ``` server { listen 80; listen [::]:80;
 server_name subdomain.domain.tld; location / { return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri; } 
 }
 server { listen 443 ssl http2; listen [::]:443 ssl;
 server_name subdomain.domain.tld; set $forward_scheme http; set $server "the-container-name"; set $port 5000; # The SSL certificate stuff resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=30s; location / { add_header X-Served-By $host; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Scheme $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_pass $forward_scheme://$server:$port$request_uri; } 
 } ```
 The Nginx error log says that it can't resolve the-container-name, which makes me think it's a DNS issue. How do I get Nginx to use my Docker network's DNS?
 I ran docker network inspect common and got the network's subnet, gateway but I don't really know what to do with those. I tried using the gateway as the resolver address but that didn't work either.
 I'm really confused about all of this so any pointers would be appreciated.
 Edit: Couldn't figure out any solution on my own and found out from another post on r/nginx that it isn't easily dosable, so I just published the necessary ports to localhost and proxied them that way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon everyone!
 So, I could be blind so please... Do not shoot me!
 I am currently looking for a self-hosted "Development" tracking software to self-host on my own home network that I can setup and allow certain people to access, update, maintain notes, concepts, media, etc. So far, I have seen a few sites and services that are "paid" but I would much prefer to self-host for more control over data, etc.
 I came across "Nuclino" to which honestly isn't pricy to have access to each month but, still this is a paid "Cloud Host" service.
 My question is, does anyone know of something out there that is similar to the example provided below? (Nuclino Screenshot)
 Nuclino Dashboard - Tracking & Media
 So far, the only thing I seem to find is more of a "Media" tracker solution that allows you to mark what you have watched, played, etc.
 Any suggestions and/or ideas are greatly appreciated. I would prefer to not use a spreadsheet or word document to track info. Gets very tedious and jumbled. lol

 Settings Editor
 Major changes in this release
  
Added a built-in settings editor
 Included settings.sample.json that auto-creates settings.json if it doesn't exist (but doesn't overwrite existing settings.json)
 Changed .html pages to .php (please delete your existing index.html file if you're already using Dasherr)
  
Like I've said before, Dasherr is a learning project for me, and also a way to give back something to this sub that has helped me for 1+ year of creating and maintaining my own selfhosted homeserver (still makes me proud every time I pass by and look at it)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've searched through and couldn't find a recent answer to this question, and I know things change all the time so here we go again!
 I have a load of DVD's and Blu-Ray's that are just taking up room because we don't have a player anymore.
 Some of these films and TV Series aren't available on streaming platforms (for example the BBC's version of "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" from 1988 or "Five Children and It" from 1991!) so we want to make them available to watch again.
 I'm more than happy with ripping them to storage, but I've no idea which media server to use.
 In the past, I've run Plex and that was fine, but I don't really need 90% of the features it offers.
 I already have subscriptions to Amazon, Netflix, Now, Disney+, and probably a couple of others, so it really is just to serve up these DVD rips so I can pack the DVD's away in the loft.
 It seems the choice is between Plex (good for beginners, not particularly flexible), Jellyfin (seems to be mainly used by those who torrent?), and Emby (not sure what the difference is between this and Jellyfin other than the name, I do know it's a fork though!).
 If you were in my situation, what would you use?

 I really want to get in to the home lab game and getting something like an R420 is compelling to me other than the fact that it pulls down somewhere between 100-200 watts even at idle. That said, I know very little about hardware so I don't even know where to begin to look for something that would be closer to what I'm looking for. I hope some of you fine people can point me in the right direction!
 I'm looking to run the *arr apps with jellyfin, opnsense, pihole, home assistant, and have some room for doing little projects in docker/k8s.

 I am looking for a selfhosted solution/application that may help in capturing details of products, services etc and help in visually comparing them. Use case: when you are on a fence and don't know what to buy you take a spreadsheet and make columns with Pros and Cons and then still scratch your head. A web app may be more helpful in this regard, especially if it allows collaboration with other people.
 If no such selfhosted web application is coming to mind, even a standalone desktop application suggestions will be appreciated.
 Thanks

 I’m planning to buy an external hard drive to use sometimes, not to be always plugged to PC.
 I’ve read some reviews here on Reddit about WD and it seems people don’t quite like them, saying something about the USB connection being problematic if I understand correctly..
 It’s just that they are cheaper than the Seagate drives from example, and I wonder if it should be fine to the “average” user - I mean it would suffice if it will just work as intended without failing suddenly.
 Thanks in advance.

 ​
 I was thinking if it would be worth hosting an instance of SearXNG, Invidous for Youtube and NextCloud for office and sync tasks in the same server an have them all in the page to make like an opensource alternative of what Google or major proprietary search engines do?
 PS: For the email side I don't know which solutions would be good.

The main trick seemed to be to make sure one downloaded and used the Dell OEM VMware edition of the ISO, not the regular one. That seemed to provide all the drivers needed. It is absolutely unsupported processor, and it says so, but it will let you run. I've got mainly Windows 2016 servers as VM's and Win10 desktops running on it. Anyway, thought people might be interested as there are a ton of them on EBay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Previously on r/homelab: https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/yftmqy/ups_battery_advice/
 Since that post I've submitted a work order to my apartments about the electical wiring in the apartment. It has yet to be addressed.
 Today the UPS started sounding an audible alarm. I was able to get to the APC's page immediately and saw it had a self test in progress and was showing a battery fault. The self test eventually failed and the alarm stopped once it was back on mains input.
 In my previous post the idea of a faulty battery controller was raised. So the way I see it I have two possibilities here:
  
The UPS (APC Smart UPS 1500 X) has a faulty battery controller or some other internal component.
 The UPS has a dying or faulty battery needing replacement.
  
I'd like to try to optimize my use of funds so I'd prefer to replace the specific faulty part without replacing unnecessary parts as well.
 Now, an interesting point is that I can trigger a manual self test from the web GUI and it runs with no alarm and passes successfully. These failure/alarm events seem to be sporadic so I think I'm on the early side of an equipment failure. How can I try to isolate the problem cost effectively? I know I can pull batteries and put them on a multimeter but that won't test them under load conditions. I have no idea how to test the UPS internals beyond the self test or just unplugging it from mains.

 Issues:
 - Screenshots are processed with twitter login-to-view popup, which blocks the rendered screen and ruins the screenshots too.
 - I know these popups can be avoided by using json authentication and excluding elements using javascript , (I don't have programming skills, don't have twitter API as well)
 Goals:
 I want to scrape a public twitter account using a bot that crawls for new tweets and screenshots them as soon they are posted. (Media content is not necessary, just screenshot of tweet is fine).
 I know there are other tools available that save tweets as CSV, JSON but I am looking for Visual/screenshots. 
 Suggestions are welcome.

 I have a question for you who are surely more experienced than me about collecting data: I would need to download all the images on this site (www.antweb.org) for a project I am working on (as well as for data hoarding, of course ;D). Could you illustrate a way to do this automatically (or at least semi-automatically)?
 Ideally, I would like to be able to download all the images related to a single ant genus (e.g., all those on this page "https://www.antweb.org/browse.do?subfamily=myrmicinae&genus=messor&rank=genus") into a single folder, and then do the same with the other genera I need.
 Can you tell me if there is a program or something similar that can help me in this endeavor? Or am I doomed to download all the images I need one by one, manually?
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought a couple of 1U 24 port keystone patch panels (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097RV9DP9?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) and I'm liking them except I'd liked to swap out the default inserts of 1-24 for 1-47 (odds) and 2-48 (evens) to match my switch.
 I could hand write them out, but I'd like something a little nicer looking. Has anyone used a template for something like MS Word to create their own label templates?

 So the question is, doe anyone know of any way of exporting all the images? I once came across paid for software that claimed to do it. But don't want to pay for it if it ends up the GUI app is just running some powershell commands in the background.
 Anyone know?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The storage space on my Acer Aspire 5 laptop is soon going to run out. It has a 1TB m.2 NVME, which I really like, but there is no second m.2 slot. However, there is expansion space for a 2.5 inch SATA drive. I'm planning to get a 2TB secondary SSD that I will be using for games, photos and most other things that don't necessarily benefit from the high NVME speeds. 
 Furthermore, I'm trying to get as much out of this drive in terms of longevity as I will be able to. My laptop is 2,5 years old and I'll likely be using it for another 2-4 years. After that I will either build the SSD into a PC, or if I'm not going for a PC build and buying another laptop instead I'm guessing that it will probably not come with expansion space for a 2.5 inch drive. My plan then is to buy an enclosure from Amazon to turn it into a USB-C external drive that I will be using as a backup drive for photos, important files and also some less important files. It therefore won't require a ton of reads and writes anymore at that point and will likely just sit around a lot with the data. (Unless this is for some reason a bad idea?).
 So my question is should I go for the MX500, which seems to be the S-tier SATA SSD in terms of price/performance or is that overkill in my case, since I will not be using it as a primary drive? It's clear to me that I need a drive with TLC and not QLC, but does it need DRAM? For example there are SSDs like the Silicon Power Ace A55 which are TLC but without DRAM for 2/3 of the price. Will the difference in build quality matter in terms of longevity? or is there another one that you can recommend me for my situation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What’s a good option for replacing Google/Apple shared albums?
 A situation just came up where I wanted to gather photos from several family members into one shared album. I wound up doing it via Apple as it was easy to just send a link to everyone but I was wondering how a true self hoster would deal with this. I keep all of my personal photos in a photoprism instance sitting on top of my own file organization, but with only one user I don’t see a good way to keep the libraries separate. 
 Here are my current thoughts: 1. Just use Apple or Google for gathering, as it is easy to set up, once photos are gathered I can download them and use some other app to share if necessary 2. Create a separate photoprism for each album or group I’m sharing with. Uploading to photoprism via WebDAV is intuitive and works from phones or computers
 Feel free to ignore my options and just suggestion your own.

I have terabytes of media, I'd love to share with him but he really can't manage navigating a Plex share and I can't afford the time to burn DVDs for him. I'm wondering if there is some kind of media player that has storage that will plug directly into his TV, can manage H.265 compression, and has an easy to navigate menu system. In this way I can just do a "sneakernet" to this player from my NAS to keep him up to date on new releases. Any suggestions welcome! Thanks!

 I am looking for self hosted image gallery software that does not alter the source files in anyway. I have found various self hosted galleries but either the alter files/location of the files, or are just terrible. 
 I also dont care for face recognition or anything that sends my images out to AI on the web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As far as I understand from my research, to be able to use Cloudflare Tunnels for free, you have to use their SSL certificates and thus allowing them to see all traffic going through the tunnel, right?
 One reason I'm self-hosting some services for my friends is that they don't want their data in the hands of big companies. Of course you can argue that if Cloudflare actually read your traffic contents and that fact got leaked, they'd be in a lot of trouble, but ideally I'd have a setup where they can't read the traffic in the first place. However, in order to do that, I'd basically need a TCP proxy for port 443, and I think none of their free offers include that.
 Is there a solution for this that doesn't require paying for a VPS or opening ports on my home network? Maybe I just have to accept that I need to have ports 80 and 443 open and hope I don't get DDOSed or something.
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The case I have for my NAS has 12 HDD bays so instead of using the 8 SATA capable LSI controller, I opted for the 9201-16i. It's a great card, but I'm looking to upgrade my machine and I'm wondering if there is a newer card out there that is taking advantage of a newer version of PCIe in order to require fewer lanes. Granted with 12x HDDs I'm probably not even using 4 PCIe lanes, it's proven to be very difficult to find a motherboard that will support x16 and x8 at the same time, you definitely can do x16 and x4 at the same time though.
 My end goal is to have a pretty beefy NAS that can use Intel quicksync for Plex transcodes, passthrough a GPU to a VM, have a 10Gb NIC, and can use at least 15 (probably 16) drives. I know it won't be cheap, but obviously I'm looking to do this as reasonably affordable as possible.

 How reliable are SSD external hard drives? Should I expect it to fail soon? Like an old conventional magnetic disk drive could? It's kept on a desk at room temperature, never moves and just collects a bit of dust that I periodically clean off. Is this a safe device to keep pictures, music, files, etc. on? Or should I begin making plans to replace it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Basically the title. Recently changed broadband providers and this new router does not allow port forwarding of any kind. 
 Being said, I'm looking for a VPN service to deploy while I don't install my own router. I have a few in mind like tailscale and cloudflare access, but would like your opinion or what your solution is.
 Some requirements:
 - No need for port forwarding
 - At least two different users
 - Must use pubkey authentication or MFA (hardware key support would be great)
 - Access to entire LAN (for example, if I connect to the VPN server, I need to be able to access my router)
 - Local DNS (when connected, the traffic would use a DNS server in my LAN)
 - Highly desirable to work with docker/k8s but not a deal-breaker
 ​
 In the past I had a wireguard container running rock-solid, but without port-forwarding I can't do this.
 What do you lot reckon?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm building my own homelab, and for some reason I want to use OpenLDAP for centralized user management. I'm pretty comfortable with Linux but quite new about Directories.
 Let's say now I've a bunch of services that I'd like to control who can access depending its group. So depending the users groups, it can access or not to the service. Users can be real users or services accounts as well. I've 50 users and many more groups and services accounts.
 Now my question are: * First, am I using the appropriate tool to achieve what I want ? * How do you manage groups permissions for your services/groups ? Do you have a quite flat forest or is it deeply nested with tons of OUs ? * How do you manage your group of users in OpenLDAP ? It seems nested groups are not a recommanded pattern for LDAP server, but at the same time managing flats groups of users seems very tedious to do. We can trick with overlays and plugins, but most of documentations warns you about potential performance issues. * Do you need to script some processes or you do everything by hand ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a server I built up over the years that I've recently installed a GUI on instead of just SSHing in and find myself using it as my main PC now at my desk.
 Also, I've started cycling indoors using the game/app Zwift. I've tried running it on my old laptop but it's just too old and underpowered. So my only option without buying a new computer is use my server to run Zwift. I've tried running it via Lutris/WINE but you can't access bluetooth or ANT+ so it's not ideal and it crashes randomly for me.
 I figured the solution is to just run Windows as the base OS (for Zwift) but run all the actual server media stuff (arr's, qbit, plex, vaultwarden, caddy, etc.) in a Linux VM. All of my podman config and media are in a 6 drive BTRFS array separate from the OS.
 I'm just not sure if this is a terrible idea or not, and if I did this, can I leave my BTRFS file system untouched and just mount it to the VM after I set it up?
 ​
 Server Specs: i7-4790, 250GB sandisk SSD for OS, 25 TB BTRFS array, 8GB RAM

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I decided to build a rack in my home to simplify my studio setup by first isolating all the hardware noise in a soundproof small room. I'm also taking the opportunity to replace my current "not really a server" which is a slow Mac Mini with a 24tb raid 10 thunderbolt bay with Soft Raid.
 What I do with my server:
  
Plex Media Server with 5x simultaneous streams
 Home Assistant (Z-Wave, ZigBee & security cameras)
 Download torrents
  
I'm on a budget and I'm currently looking at the Synology 8 Bay RackStation RS1221+ (Diskless) sold at 1900$ CAD and 8x Seagate 16TB HDD Exos X16 drives in SHR-2 for a total of 96tb. With taxes and everything I'm at 4600$ CAD. It seems to be the cheapest server out there. I would have liked to be able to transcode but I haven't found any server that can do this in these price ranges.
 Am I missing something somewhere, do you have any recommendations? Keep in mind that I'm in Canada and everything cost more here. Thank you!

 Given that I already use stuff like vscode-remote which I access on my iPad (among many other services on my server), I was wondering if there was a LaTeX editor that I could host via Docker.

 I want to check and see if there is a connection issue at my end. If there is some service that provide such monitoring out of the box, it will help identify any issues with the router or internet connection.
 Thanks for your inputs.

 Do you expect to have to upgrade in a year, 5 years, or more?
 Edit: Thanks everyone for their take! Just so you guys know where I'm at, I'm running a T620 for the past ~3 years that I bought used. I'm planning on using it for a few more years, but I wasn't sure when I needed to think more seriously about upgrades. For my gaming pc it's pretty easy for me GPU-wise. I always buy used when everyone else is dumping their old hardware and try to stay only 2-3 generations behind the latest.

 Anyway, my son has heard me talk about back in the day we would all get together for LAN parties and now he wants to host one. I told him Id help him setup in our basement (secretly excited myself for it lol). 
 I started thinking about the possibility of infection from these PCs. Im not over the top secure in my home network but I like to be at least aware. Everything is locked down to the latest standards of the hardware/firmware, guest wifi access is given for those who do not live here, etc.
 How do I secure these devices from the rest of my network while still giving them internet access?
 My thought was to use an old router I have, configure that on my network and allow them to hardwire into it. That should allow them to see each other, but nothing else, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently come into posession of an old HP Stream 11 notebook/netbook. Nothing much to write home about. Celeron N3050, 2GB ram, 32GB eMMC storage. Currently has a broken screen. To the best of my knowledge the rest of the hardware is fine, though I do need to verify.
 Been trying to figure out some way I could make use of it especially as a low power proc (per Intel's ARK page it has a maximum TDP of 6w and a design TDP of 4w). Most of my existing uses are already taken care of. Got an Unraid box running 99% of my services. I also have a spare Haswell based box running Proxmox that stays powered off most of the time unless I need an extra VM or two for testing. Also have a number of spare Pi's floating around including one unused Pi 4 2GB should I find a need for those.
 My initial thought and what would be a really hacky setup is using this as a router running either PFsense or OPNsense (likely the latter). Been probably a good 20 years since I last messed with PFsense in any capacity. Plan was to take out the Mini-PCI-e Wifi card and replace it with a dual ethernet adapter such as the following barring HP hasn't put any dumb BIOS locks in this thing (this is just an example, seems like many of these exist with different chipsets.):
 https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832762232251.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2usa4itemAdapt&_randl_shipto=US
 I'm perfectly fine with hacking this thing up physically at this point. It was a poor daily driver as it came out of the box let alone with any modern OS/web usage so it's never going back to that.
 Just curious if there's any reason why this wouldn't be a viable option? Or maybe some other cool suggestions to make use of this hardware I may have not thought of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm thinking about just not updating my self hosted apps anymore. The reason is that I have a mini heart attack every time I update, wondering if the update will break things. It hasn't happened yet on Linux (definitely has happened on Windows) and I always back things up before updating, but it's more about the unnecessary stress. 
 If I'm happy with an app the way it is, is it okay to not update it? I'm a beginner and use only a handful of things like Docker, Bookstack, Jellyfin, Tracks, Portainer, and some miscellaneous stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm upgrading from Edgerouter X, unmanaged switch, single unifi AP to a completely new system in a bigger place. I'm weighing my options, thinking of pfsense router/firewall, mikrotik managed switch, 2 or 3 Mikrotik APs. I intend to have 2 VLANS for general use and IoT separation.
 My main reason for leaving unifi is that I don't like needing dedicated hardware for their controller software (used to host the old controller on my PC) and they don't make non UISP routers anymore (I'm moving to a rack mounted space anyway).
 If I go with my proposed new setup above, how do I manage my Mikrotik APs if I'm using pfsense as my router? Is it as simple as running the managed switch in RouterOS mode rather than SwitchOS mode? 
 I can't find a tutorial for this exact situation to test before spending hundreds on equipment.

 I checked the serial at Seagate and it has a valid warranty until 12/21/2027. So according to Seagate, it has 5 years and month. He offers 2 years.
 My question is, would Seagate respect the warranty if I go to them with an invoice from a small computer store that doesn't sell to business?
 Is there a way these could be refurbished? Could I tell somehow??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a desperate attempt to move away from Adobe's photography subscription (I mainly used Lightroom Classic to organize my family photos on a NAS), I recently – and with the help of this sub – stumbled across Photoprism. I tried it in read-only mode on my existing photo collection and decided that I quite liked it. So I went ahead and bought a 4-bay QNAP with Docker capabilities and a bunch of new harddisk drives. I then exported everything from Lightroom (to maintain my edits and keep the source files untouched ... for now) and started to fill in missing EXIF date tags, teach the face-recognition algorithms and so on. I'm not fully done yet, but I quite like what I am seeing, and wife/family acceptance is fine, too. 
 But there are a few basic things missing, like:
 - an easy way to batch edit tags and other metadata
 - basic retouching and editing (or even simple things like "turn image 90 degrees")
 - simple file and folder operations like "copy" or "move"
 Apart from that, I really love Photoprism! 
 But I was wondering: would it make sense to just spin up another Docker container pointing to the same directories and use a tool like Piwigo or LibrePhotos alongside Photoprism? I guess there are quite a few reasons not to do something like that (permissions, constant need for rescanning, access violations, possible data corruption, ...), but maybe anybody here has already tried something like this? I'd really appreciate to hear some thoughts and maybe even first-hand experiences. 
 PS: I've already tried running DarkTable alongside Photoprism ... but found it quite unusable – mostly due to the laggy, unintuitive UI.

 i'm wondering what, if anything, the good folks here are using as a KVM solution.
 something i'm exploring is using the PiKVM into a splitter, into 2x TESmart 16-port HDMI KVMs (to support expansion). is this viable? i haven't ever used a KVM before, so i'd appreciate any "gotchas" that i should be aware of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to do a brain dump and have you all tell me what i am forgetting or if its a bad idea. I wanted to create a plex server and setup some authentication in the house for mgmt. So that got me thinking to do the following instead of getting a separate box to run as a server i would just extend my current pc and convert it to an all in one machine. 
 1) Base OS - Win HyperV via Server 2022 or OpenSuse and KVM/QEMU (use onboard igpu/apu)
 2) VM1 - Authentication Server and DNS and any other services that i need in the future
 3) Plex Server - GPU passthrough (cheap card for encoding), lots of storage
 4) Game Server - Windows 11 running Steam for steam link game streaming and native games ? (gaming gpu like a 6800/6900/3080 etc... )
 The thought process was i would use my laptop for work and stream games to the laptop and living room when i wanted to game. 
 I wanted to also maybe spin up a daily driver OS so #5) OpenSuse for normal browsing, documents, bill pay etc... 
 So questions
 1) What do you think?
 2) What am i forgetting to think about?
 3) Any reason not to use the base OS that runs hyper visor to also be the game server removing the need for #4? Steam updates never ask for a pc reboot so it would just be OS updates which the base os would have anyway. 
 4) Any reason to build a completely separate server and leave my pc as a dedicated gaming/work pc.

 I have a pool on zfs with drives that are fairly new - probably about 3-4 months. On a recent zpool scrub, it turned up some errors that the scrub fixed. The SMART status on these drives is strange - it says the device lacks SMART capability. 
 I am not certain how to proceed now. Are there any further steps that I could take to verify the drive without SMART working? Would it be okay to leave things as they are, and zpool clear the device, since scrub fixed the errors? Or should I request for RMA on the drive?
 Below are the outputs from zpool status and smartctl:

 Seems like a decent deal for a set of 5, especially if you run them in RAID.
 Usually you can reformat 520 or 528 byte drives to 512 byte using sg_format, but there are some weird cases where you can't. Just wondered if anyone's tried these before I "take the risk" myself.
 There's a lot of them up for sale. It's not the best deal in terms of $/TB for SSD, but it's not too bad either, and if you're looking for high IOPS or redundancy for a smaller dataset it's not bad. I'm interested in maybe using these for a ~500GB array that I want in raidz2. The array will experience high random I/O so SSDs are basically a must.

 System BIOS: 1.6.0 IDRAC setting ver: 1.30.30.27 Message under IDRAC settings: -SWC0700: DRAC is not ready. The configuration values cannot be accessed.
 My first thought was to update bios and IDRAC firmware, which all attempts to do so have been unsuccessful. 
 Questions: Some “idrac initialization error” YouTube videos brought me to this Reddit page. 
 From similar threads It sounds like a motherboard issue. How do I verify that? 
 I’ve also been trying to boot with usb to upgrade the firmware but it never sees any files on the target device. From what I understand I have to format the usb fat32 but besides that do I just use the .exe From dells products and drivers
 Thanks everyone.

 I decided to build my own self-hosted file storage after my bad experience with Nextcloud. While it is a great and powerful product, on my old laptop it was really really slow, especially scrolling through large directories was a struggle. 
 My goal is to give a better experience while keeping things efficient. You can easily run it on a slow machines (e.g. DigitalOcean basic droplet with 1vCPU & 1GB RAM) and still have a nice performance.
 Shelf is currently at the MVP stage and doesn't do much, other than stores your file, but it already supports S3-compatible storages (S3, Minio, DO Spaces).
 Feel free to try the cloud version or you can try to run it locally, it should as easy as running docker compose up
 Please, let me know what you think about the project

 Even after activation, updates, virtio drivers installed, it's showing ridiculously high ram usage. Like, constantly showing 15/16 GB used, staying 85-95% at all times.
 It doesn't matter if it's only hosting a single RDC at the desktop sitting idle after a reboot, ram already jumping to 85-95%.
 I ran sfc /scannow, I ran dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, I cleaned out SoftwareDistribution and re-ran Windows Updates, and no change.
 In task manager, there's no processes using more than maybe 256mb, and adding them all up it's under 2gb used.
 Using ProcExp, I see svchost for Local Service and NetSvc as the big culprits, but I don't see anything in Task Manager using the ram. Screenshot from Taskmgr
 Anyone have any ideas what I should do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure what I'm doing wrong. I've installed Pi-hole and Unbound on my container platform (Synology).
 Settings/Config:
 My routers IP is 192.168.0.1 and my Pi-Hole is 192.168.0.30 (Macvlan network).
 Here is the compose code:
  pihole: image: cbcrowe/pihole-unbound:latest environment: - ADMIN_EMAIL=xxxxxx@gmail.com - TZ=Europe/London - WEBPASSWORD=password - ServerIP=192.168.0.30 - PIHOLE_DNS_=127.0.0.1#5335 - DNSSEC=true networks: macvlan: ipv4_address: 192.168.0.30 volumes: - /volume1/docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d - /volume1/docker/pihole/config:/etc/pihole restart: unless-stopped 
 I can access the Web interface fine. In Settings > DNS, the following is set:
  
Custom Upstream DNS Server: 127.0.0.1#5335
 Respond only on interface eth0
 Never forward non-FQDN A and AAAA queries
 Never forward reverse lookups for private IP ranges
 Use DNSSEC 
 Use conditional forwarding: 
 Local network - 192.168.0.0/24 | IP add of router: 192.168.0.1 | Local domain name: LAN
 
  
Issue 1:
 So far, just for testing, I've manually assigned my laptop the IP address of my Pi-Hole server and for the majority of time, I've noticed internet access is fine however intermittently I will get a 404 on a page. I have 2 other devices next to me on the same network and they can access the site fine.
 Here is a Pi-hole screen shot of when the issue occurred when I tried to access the hub.Docker website at 16:34.
 This is annoying and will potentially be a deal-breaker if I can't even get my own device working properly.
 Issue 2:
 When I change my router settings so that DHCP clients receive the Pi-Hole IP for their DNS - my 404's and timeouts starts becoming more and more regular. My partner also says that Internet access becomes intermittent.
 Here is a Pi-Hole screen shot of some warnings that appear when I enable all devices on my LAN to use Pi-Hole.
 Hoping for some words of wisdom from you guys - any help is much appreciated.

 I do no really care for the physical phone, the hardware etc. All that’s important to me is everything inside the phone, even up to the search history lol. So that I can simple just place the backup into any iPhone if need may be.
 Ive made a backup of the phone on my macbook, but idk is that it? What else can I do to make it more secure/safe.
 (I have all their passwords/passcodes so that isnt a problem)

 I see it hovers at 86% CPU Usage and TP-Link wasn’t sure what “normal” is, however, I can saturate a link and the usage doesn’t change. 
 After all of the stability issues I’ve had with my CRS826-24S+2Q+RM with SwOS I’m hoping the TP-Link just switches packets around. So far so good though and setup was a breeze including VLAN’s. 
 I’ll give it a bit and then sell the Mikrotik.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a little preface. I started doing live visual performances for music events, VJing. The content you see on led walls, projection mapping. That stuff. Lots of data to store and need quick access to it. My live production machine has a nvme slot, a sata m.2 slot, both populated with 512gb drives. As well as a 512gb ssd. 4tb nvm drives and sata m.2 are so expensive. Would be a big jump in storage yes but for 6-800 for a single drive I think I could do something else. I can find 2tb ones that are much cheaper but that doesn't really give me a increase in size I would need. I have a tb of data im waiting to put on the machine and have access so doing a 2tb upgrade would be filled out immediately and even if I did both m.2's I'd only have a little bit of space that could be filled out with the next set of visuals I acquire. I had been thinking trying to put something together that can store all my content and even save my showfile on the drive so I can load it up into any machine with the software and perform. So that had me start thinking of a external drive or case that could allow me to have a lot of storage and still have the ability to be accessed with high speeds. I found this case, has a small amount of bad reviews but for things that could be handled over warranty. Not many that would make me not want to try it out. has anyone tried this thing out? I love the idea of having some redundancy on it. I can outfit this with 2 or 4tb ssd's starting at 1200 for the entire deal. Or does anyone else have any suggestions for a small case that can be outfitted with multiple drives? Will be using ssd's so smaller size and 2.5 is preferred. I'm not afraid of a Linux based OS to do Software raid if the machine allows. I'd rather have a USB interface handle it all for simplicity but if having a cheap nas is a better idea, I do run my own network during events and can have it tapped in.

 I'm a web backend developer trying to setup a web server for my remote development purposes.
 I need a node.js (nest.js to be specific) app to be running and it will be connected to postgres and redis docker containers in the same machine and i want to access my api from my router's static IP. I tried couple things but failed miserably. Since it falls into devops area, i dont want to dive deep into researching and experimenting. 
 At this point what steps I need to follow to be honest.
 Is there a guide or app preferably with gui serves to this purpose?

 Context: earlier today the Magic the Gathering trading card game website announced while moving to a new website design tomorrow they would be getting rid of many if not most old articles covering many aspects of the design and history of the game. I wanted to see if you could help show me/ recommend the best way to save these articles for personal viewing in bulk (as I would ask all of you to do it for me) and reading just in case the Internet archive doesn't have them all backed up?
 They only told us one day before the destruction. Thank you for any tips or help I kind of got overwhelmed searching the subreddit for tips or advice as I'm not especially technically savvy.

 I don't know much about how this would work, but I'm thinking oracle free tier + Nordvpn then torrent using the transmission vpn container directly onto a mounted hetzner storage box.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on that? -- or specific workflows I can follow up accomplish this?
 One thing I don't understand is how much file crawling these providers do. I'm guessing I should be encrypting and mounting the hetzner box, and i should somehow be encrypting the Oracle vm, but I'm not really sure if that's possible or what that really means.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, my grandfather used to say "before you start a job, make sure you have all the tools/parts". I'm trying to figure out how to best use the parts I've just obtained.
 For a while now I've had a FreeNAS box running on old PC hardware (older i5). That's been working fine, and it's running Jellyfin, but I've been doing everything manually. 
 Recently I inherited some hardware from a job and I'm wondering how best to put it to use.
 I now have an unused Mac Pro (2013 "trash can" version), an empty Synology DS2415+, 2 Raspberry Pi 3-B's, 3 Seagate 7200rpm (but 750gb) drives, and an assortment of external WD drives (2-4tb each, but none of them match).
 So, a Frankenstein project to be sure. 
 A couple questions:
 What should I run Jellyfin on? What would be the best for transcoding? If I wanted to set up SABnzbd, Sonarr/Radarr, etc to automate everything, what would that run best on (I've never used any of those before)?
 My first thought was use the Mac Pro to run the apps, it has the most horse power (12-core Xeon E5, 64GB of DDR3). But do I use that for SAB/rarr and then have it pass everything to FreeNAS? Do I put the drives in the FreeNAS or the Synology (even though they don't match)? Do I use FreeNAS to run everything but set the Synology as the attached storage? Do I get rid of FreeNAS and just use the Synology and the Mac instead? Do I use the Pi's for anything (like PiHole) and is there any advantage to that over just running them in a container on the other systems?
 I have a Win10 PC I use on a daily basis, so the Mac is purely extra, and not used while everything is running (if that makes a difference).
 Any advice in how you'd best use a collection of pieces like this would be most appreciated!
 Edit: Yes, I know FreeNAS is now TrueNAS, that's how long it's been since I've upgraded anything, lol.

 "/downloads/completed is not writable with special character filenames. This can cause problems." 
 I read somewhere that this can be from not having UTF-8 encoding enabled on both ends. From what I can see that is already done. Anyone seen this or have any ideas?

The read and write speed doesn't matter (as long as it doesn't take a whole month to write the 10gb). I am looking for a medium that is compact (less than the size of a novel). Therefore, writing on paper or engraving in stone is not an option.

 I am trying to find a tool which is related to image recongition but I feel this becomes too complex for what I need it to do.
 Basically, I have a bank of images along with a unique code for each image which should act as my main matching database.
 I then have another set of images which need to all be compared to this master list and if it finds an exact match or very close it will assign the unique code to it.
 Ideally, the output should be a simple CSV with image name in column A then the matched unique code in column B (if found).
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I am wanting to setup a few VMs as VPS's. Has anyone done this before? Did some searching, but nothing clear on exactly how to set it up. So basically, I have VM hosts in my DC and want to setup a website to log into, and click on the server and it will launch a RDP session in a sense. I also want to make this available for a few users that want to run "test labs". I know in Windows Server you can setup an RD Gateway and host a site to set a group of RDS servers for people to log into. Would that be the best way of doing it? I've set it up before, been a while, but can definitely do it again if that is the easiest way. But I would have to have RDS licensing for it. Was trying to avoid that part of it. But if I can't, then I will buy them. Just curious as to if anyone else has this kind of setup already? Thanks!

 Intended applications:
  
Samba/file sharing
 Database for interval data from various sensors (pretty much 24/7 writing and data being read for various reports and dashboards)
 Backups
 A couple game servers
 
 I see people saying that using consumer-grade SSDs for this is a bad idea and they will fail pretty quickly. Does anyone have experience with this? I like the idea of having SSD-grade performance and will also have a secondary backup system with a variety of mechanical drives I have saved. 
 What are the odds I regret my SSD choice 2 years from now?

 I'm thinking of getting a TR-004 to expand my QNAP TS453Bmini. I have a APC Back-UPS that detects power outage and tells my NAS to shut down within a certain amount of time. I was not able to find out if this functionality would extend to a connected TR-004 as well. Can anyone here answer this for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll start with my use case.
  
home server
 docker with a bunch of containers running I need to access, some have no login you just got o the servers local IP and port to open them
 also use SMB very frequently
  
Current solution
  
all services only accessible via local network
 use openvpn tunnel to access said network and services
 to remain somewhat secure using random wifi AP's and mobile data I tunnel 100% of my traffic rather than just using the openvpn tunnel to access the local network
  
My problem is I am remote all the time and would much prefer to be tunneling all my traffic through mullvad vpn. Using openvpn to my home network means that traffic is exposed to my home internet ISP. SO in this case I understand I could use a reverse proxy to solve it. Say using my phone > mullvad vpn > nginx (for example) > one of my docker containers. This would give applications a secure way to login without directly exposing them to the internet, right? Would it be possible to host this reverse proxy on the same server that hosts my services? Is this advisable or am I better off with a premade solution from say cloudflare? I do have access to one of those free oracle cloud instances but I think the download bandwidth is capped pretty low on them, while upload is not, so it would probably run out of data acting as a tunnel for all of my data, streaming 4k movies or whatever. Will I still be able to use SMB with something like this?

 I recently came across an article that showcased different setups for exposing your homelab to the internet. I am fairly new to working with this type of setup, so any help is much appreciated!
 I looked into two setups that I could possibly set up and wondered how difficult, or what the difference would be between the two.
 https://theorangeone.net/posts/exposing-your-homelab/#vpn-only - I assume is a VPN tunnel? Not sure what this is, could someone explain? How would I go about setting this up if I have a VPS?
 The other is the VPN Gateway: https://theorangeone.net/posts/exposing-your-homelab/#vpn-gateway

When I start writing 1 TB of data to it and it doesn't read it all back, it's going to be obvious it's a lower capacity device hacked to claim it's higher capacity. Or, if it actually will store the full 1 TB, it's some flaky off-brand tech that has the shelf life of unrefrigerated milk.

 I don't want anything DDR3 or older, only DDR4. I was looking at Dell R230's as they seem like the best option currently. What's everyone think?

However there are times where there will only be one user. I would like both stations with their peripherals with monitors correspondingly, and for a single user to be able to use both stations and multiple monitors. 
 I see most kvms are only focused on limiting to one set of peripherals and one user. Is there a solution that can flex both active users and monitors ? 
 TLDR: Need a switch for 2 active peripherals x 2computers x 3 displays 
 1 user can control both laptops and all monitors, or 2 users can use their corresponding monitor and one of those two can duplicate their display

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming none of us have hardened facilities/homes/shops to store computers in, Most servers are one home burglary away from being stolen. In linux, how would you implement remote offsite backups?
 You cant just encrypt the offsite server's drive because they would require to be decrypted every time the server is rebooted.
 Please correct me if im wrong, but I think the way to do it is to temporarily encrypt my important data on my local nas to an empty SSD, where I would then rsync it to my remote server.
 remote server can stay wide open and so long as my host OS drive is ecrypted, my sata hdd's can remain in the clear because all they would hold is encrypted files that only I have the key for.
 How do you guys do it?

 Questions:
 I am currently looking for a LSI HBA SAS card, because many people said that the performance was good. Do you guys have any recommendations for an HBA card with 8 or more ports based on value (>$100 preferably, will be able to do >$150)?
 Also, ELI5, what is the meaning of the numbers that come behind the card type, e.g. LSI 6Gbps SAS HBA 9220-8i, or LSI 9300-4i4e (just for example)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally hit that point that everyone told me would happen - I've outgrown my 2-bay Synology, and I want something bigger. I would just get a bigger Synology, but...I really want something rack-mounted. I'm OK paying the rack tax just for the convenience factor, but I am struggling to make the right choice for it. For reference, I LOVE my Synology, and use it for a bunch of different things (media serving, backups for other devices, Docker containers).
 Option 1 - Synology RS822+. Literally exactly what I need. 4-bays with higher-capacity drives will suffice unless/until my data storage needs fundamentally change, and there is the RX418 available in that case. As mentioned before, I love my Synology. I would look at the RS422+, but not having expandable memory is a deal-breaker. The cost though is making me hesitant - $1k is a lot of money for a closed-source appliance that I can't repair/reuse for different purposes.
 Option 2 - Custom Unraid box. I am totally fine with messing around with something that requires more setup or is less user-friendly than normal consumer products, but I don't want it to become a chore. That said...I can build one of these for a few hundred bucks cheaper than a Synology that will provide me more flexibility and easier repair/upgrades in the future. My biggest issues is finding a case that will give me at least 4 3.5" bays and is less than 19" long - preferably in a 2u form factor.
 ​
 Any thoughts either way? And if an Unraid box is my best bet, has anyone tried these cases out before, or have suggestions?
 This looks perfect, but seems to be some sort of custom item....http://www.plinkusa.net/webITX-S2082
 This Silverstone case also looks good, but is $$$: https://www.silverstonetek.com/en/product/info/computer-chassis/RM21-308/
 This Rosewill case is cheaper, but only supports 6 drives and doesn't have front-access drives (not a huge deal TBH): https://www.rosewill.com/rosewill-rsv-z2800u-silver/p/9SIA072J2Y5179

 So I just want to host a calendar that will show different status and a schedule below. 
 Calendar view that lights up with things like green if day off, red if job 1, yellow if job 2, blue if both jobs that day. 
 And then below the calendar it will show hourly time slots to show which hours of the day I'm not working. 
 Anything like this exist? I doubt it but doesn't hurt to ask.

 Anyway, I want to build a new home server. My current is an old gaming PC; AsusMobo, AMDfx, 16GB.DDR3, and GTX 780 running on Proxmox as a single server. 
 I'm thinking I can use Pi4s instead of getting new mobo, AM4 and DDR4. I'm new to cluster/stack so my original idea is that I setup a kube environment and run VMs on top, but I don't think that would work. (If I only run server images using docker engine without the need of GUI maybe) So my revised plan is installing Proxmox to each Pi4 node creating a Proxmox cluster.
 My only reason for this is thst I can chuck as many PI4s inside a full ATX case minimizing heat and power consumption. I live in a shared appt so my current is acutally inside my room.
 Have anyone done this before?

 I have OMV running on a Dell R710, customized to my use, where I have Snapraid and UnionFS running as my raid within OMV. I have this setup over 6 drives for parity but all 6 drive bays are full. I want to swap one of my data drives, as well as the parity, with 2 new 12TB drives which gives me parity for my (now) largest drive of 12TB as well as some more usable data as my existing drives are all 4TB.
 What's the absolutely most safe and simple way to do this? I have Rsync running with google workspace for cloud storage which can also be used as a transfer spot if needed, but I'm thinking there has to be a more simple way than I'm seeing.

 So I bring this up because I don't have much use for the two sata SSD's. In fact it's very rare nowadays for me to even open them. Comparatively I do frequently access, use, and file-transfer from/to the 3TB drive. But it takes a long time to open a lot of files, and transfer. 
 The overall "reason" is split between wanting faster file transfers, less delay for opening programs or folders on HDD, and gaming / software benefits (if any) 
 I currently have the following:
  
C drive = 1 TB NVME SSD
 D drive = 256 GB Sata SSD
 F drive = 126 GB Sata SSD
 E drive = 3 TB HDD
 H drive = 1 TB Portable HDD (.... Potentially unstable)

I am hosting some shows on a jellyfin server,and some of the files are exceedingly large. For example, an episode of The Mandalorian (almost an hour, 1080p) is the same size as an episode of Evangelion (less than 20 minutes, 720p). They both are in mkv format, and around a gig or more. Where is all this extra needed storage coming from, and is there a way to shrink it without compromising any quality?
 Also, is there a good program that can pick apart files like this? being able to see all soft coded subtitles would be nice. 
 Thank you!

 I have a lot of hobby projects (Not very sensitive data) that I work on. I keep them backed up and synced to a cloud, so I can 1) revert files back to earlier versions, and 2) if my house burns down I can still retrieve my files. 
 My free OneDrive just filled up, so I am looking for a paid cloud storage now, where I can continue to keep my projects backed up.
 I would like to avoid a learning curve, and I would like everything to be as automated/easy as possible. I also don't want to be spending too much money, as I will probably just keep my subscription for the next 20+ years.
 Can anyone help?

 We purchased a new NetApp FAS 8300, and the engine part of it is too long to fit into our racks that we rent at our hosting provider. (flexential)
 At my office, we have another identical FAS 8300 and yes, it's huge but our rack has a door that was slightly 'popped' out, which allowed it to close. My hosting provider is trying to charge me for a new oversized rack, but we cannot be their only customer with NetApp.
 Curious if anyone out there has encountered this and found a way around it. (yes, the doors must close and lock, it's part of our SLA)

 What does everyone use to make their own collections available from their own NAS to the internet so you can access your own material securely and easily to either stream or download what you want at will? 
 ​
 I usually travel with an ipad or a laptop, so something that is compatible across platforms and easily usable would be ideal.

 It will likely be hand-me-down parts from my current PC inc: i5 10600, 16GB Ram, 5-8 HDDs, Maybe a GPU later down the line for a headless game streaming server.
 It will mainly be a NAS / Plex server, little bit of transcoding and the odd docker container here and there. Specs are overkill but I'd rather build a NAS / Home Server than buy a 4bay Synology for £500+ for easier expansion in the future.
 I'm just wondering if anybody has experience running a similar setup, and want kinda power draw you're pulling (idle or under load) and just how expensive is it to run something like that?
 Girlfriend won't be impressed if I hike up the power bill too much no matter how much she likes Plex!
 If it helps,. I'm paying 37p per kWh

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Noob here. I have been sorting through all these files from my past, and I thankfully have already been keeping a log of checksums for all of the files. Every time I save a new file in my 3-2-1 system, I log the checksum. That way, any time I encounter some file on an old drive I find, or someone sends me something from long ago, I can search the log for the checksum, and I'll know if I already have it or not, regardless of what we named the file. I also just like having the checksums in general, so I know the data is always good from when I received it.
 This has worked for me, and helped me avoid saving many many duplicates. I use a custom script to log everything to a single .tsv file, and I use bash to parse through it when needed. It's not pretty (nor ugly), but I figured I'd ask if I'm reinventing the wheel here, and if there is any software that does this, or if there are any better methods out there? I'd also like to know if this is extremely inefficient (say, if I wanted to do it for an entire drive at once). Also, I currently use the SHA256 algo, even though I know faster algos have very low chance of collision anyway.
 I would appreciate any critiques/input on this workflow. TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! I'm really struggling to setup snipe it. I've tried multiple tutorials, i used the "manual" method on fresh vm's, used the supplied installer and also tried the supplied docker-compose. I ve tried it locally on a vm and also on a vps. I'm not sure what to do. I always get an Error 500 when trying to access the website. When I open it in my browser it redirects me to 'ipaddress'/setup, so something is working in the background, but i just cant get it to work. Could this be a problem on my end, trying to access it? Can anyone point me to a direction i could take a look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday i was researching about this, first 20 results of google were not very encouraging. But i found a way to make this doable.
 The user case, its for example, being able to take photos in your phone, automatically upload to your server, and then, move / erase / rename either in the server, or phone, with the changes propagating in all the devices.
 So the procedure:
  
Create a new folder in your APP / Server, for example "Mobile Photos".
 Go to the the lateral menu -> Settings -> Automatic Upload
 Search for your DCIM / Camera folder, and "Configure".
 Enable the automatic upload, and select the folder of step 1 as destination. Now, the important step, its adjusting the option "The original file will....".
 Keep in original Folder (This will only upload the files to your server, 1 way synchronization)
 Move to the APP Folder / Erase (This will send the files to your Nextcloud Folder, erasing or moving the original file. Your DCIM folder will be empty, all your photos will now live in the Nextcloud Folder, example: /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/.
 Any change, either in the Phone, or the Server / PC, will be send to all the devices, accomplishing 2 way synchronization.
  
Problems:
  
For some reason, my videos are not moving to the Nextcloud folder, so they are not uploaded to the server.
 I have tested both Google / Oneplus Gallery, and none of them allow you to set /Android/media/com.netxtcloudclient/. as a "Photo Folder", so you cannot see your photos anymore from there. You can check them either on the nextcloud APP or your preferred file browser. I'm looking for a Gallery APP that allows you to set specific folders to fix this.
  
So hope this helps, and if anyone has information about the mentioned problems, please let me know!

 The problem:
 Our family has someone who has the information for the doctor and someone has the password for the EZpass login and another person has the document for the latest power bill. We are looking for a system that can contain off of this.
 I am hoping to find a Self Hosted (hopefully FOSS) application that we can use as a CRM for our family. We want to be able to track 'vendors' like doctors, dentists, power companies, ISP companies, etc. It would be awesome to have passwords for sites connected to each of the 'vendors' to ease logging into the systems with. It would be nice to track bills (manually inputted) and reoccurring payments (not as high priority).
 My dream application would be something like ITGlue where I can have related objects and assets to track all of this information.
 What I have looked at and dismissed:
  
Homechart.app - A little to clunky and to many extras. This is the closet thing I have come to find but something even simpler would be cool.
 Monica - This is for tracking personal connections. While cool, not exactly what I am looking for.
 'Real' CRMs - hubu, itflowly, salesforce, etc. These are just way to over the top and expensive

 Edit: A workable solution was determined so far, but still open to ideas: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/ypt9hh/comment/ivm4mm6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

 Used it for a bit and seemed to work fine. But on some documents it just kills the raspi. Put in an PDF (same scanner, same dpi, same page count like before) and the web ui gets unresponsive. Also SMB share and ssh access get extremely slow. Ssh usage is like one command per minute ^^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am thinking about building a very simple Pi NAS. Like, one 1 or 2TB external SSD hooked into my home network via ethernet. I am a total noob at this stuff. For redundancy maybe pay google $2 a month for cloud storage or something.
 Right now this is honestly more of a solution in search of a problem; I just like to tinker mainly. Thinking it'll just be a place to stick important files without too much trouble. Here is what I would like to be able to do:
 ​
  
Stick family photos and videos on, from any source (Windows, macOS, iOS)
 Stick important docs on (old tax turbo tax PDFs, etc)
 Maybe stick some music files on
  
Importantly, be able to VIEW and edit the files if needed. Specifically I am thinking about our pics, which are incredibly disorganized, duplicated, etc. Would like to be able to open up the iPad and go through the NAS and be like "that one sucks, DELETE... that one is upside down, FIX.... Create a "wedding pictures" folder and move all these pics over there.... etc*"
 Is all that possible?
 \One thing that I am not clear on... let's say I go to a folder full of pics on the NAS and start editing them on an iPAD (or whatever device, PC, MAC, etc). Am I using whatever photo viewing / editing SW to view and edit the file residing on the NAS (i.e. the SW is acting like a "window" to look at the file still residing on another computer).... or am I pulling the file ONTO the device, making changes, and then when I hit "save" it overwrites (uploads) the new file to the NAS?*
 I am not sure there is a fundamental difference in outcome but just wondering.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a drive fail in my 6x4TB raidz1 pool today and wondering the best way to insure I save my data. There is no other backup of the data (I know, shame me) and the drives are old and some are smr so another failure during resilver is possible.
 Now the data is a mix of music, movies and photos. The photos account for around 1 TB, music a few hundred gigs and movies about 13TB. The photos are most important as I can't replace those of I lose them but the music and movies could be replaced tho it would be a pain.
 My thought is to copy the photos to another pool while this one is still degraded and then resilver the pool. If i lose a drive while copying it wasn't going to survive the resilver anyways and I get some of my data, if the copy completes and then a drive dies in resilver I save my photos which is what I care most about.
 Any flaws with this plan? Is there a better way to go about this?

 I'm looking to setup a tagging and indexing system for my documents collection and was wondering if anyone could recommend the best software approach.

 Manually assign tags to them and filter by those tags
 Have a way to index specific files (mostly the document files), so that their contents are also searchable. 
  
Has anyone created a system that could do this? Was this a custom solution or is there existing software?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My question is essentially the title and mostly comes from idle curiosity. Do they not make 2.5" CMR drives anymore? I know seagate has one in their EXOS lineup ($600 for 2TB here... Sheesh) and a couple models from 2015~2017 seem to be CMR but that's about it. I knew 4TB+ was all SMR but I thought a few 1TB or 2TB models would still be CMR.
 The reason I'm asking (which makes less sense the more I think about it) is because I was looking for some cheap local storage for an SFF secondary build. The drive is expected to write 300~500GB and read ~1.5x that amount per day. If the drive was SMR and randomly kept dropping to 15MBps, I'd be better of just accessing the data from the network instead.
 TBW is where I ran into my first issue. Regular laptop HDDs (the one's I was expecting to find) are only rated for 55TB/Y. My estimated usage blows that out of the water meaning I should be looking at the EXOS lineup with 550TB/Y. But those are so expensive I'd be better off getting a decent SSD instead.
 Now I have to figure out if I want to save $100, forgo the SSD and just read the data from my server instead of buying an SSD and caching data locally...

 I don't personally like the fact that whenever I'm done with a movie / tv show / etc. I have to go to Radarr and Sonarr one by one, select the media, delete, tick the "remove files / folders too", confirm etc.
 It gets cumbersome for someone like me, who doesn't hoard data and gets rid of movies and shows once done with them, so I thought about writing a simple little administrative companion such as the mentioned.

 I did the Cloudflare thing, and I have to admit it's amazed me how quick I was up and running, but at the same time, I'm not sure how I feel about proxying all my data through a 3rd party.

I'd love a solution that I can deploy on a VM and automatically locate and deploy patches to Windows and Linux assets (both OS updates as well as app updates). Ideally I would love a solution like the Ivanti HEAT we used to use at work, but I'm guessing there is no home version...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm looking for an older PC to buy to create a nas using truenas or unraid. Few things:
 - It needs to have 4+ disk slots that can each support 14 terabytes, but the more slots the better.
 - Needs to be fairly cheap (less than 200ish?)
 - It needs to be fairly quiet
 The cheaper the better. I want to use this over a nas because they are all really expensive, and all the reasonably priced ones can only support so much storage. Thanks in advance!

 My question now is what hardware to use on the receiving side? A few years ago, I would just have gone with a Raspberry Pi and call it a day, but given the shortages I wonder if there's something better now. The machine would do only one thing, and that's sit there, receive network traffic and write it to disk. So I imagine network / USB bus transfer speeds are important and CPU, RAM not so much but I'm not much of a hardware guy so I figure I'd ask here.
 I know Odroid has a bunch of different boards to look at. I'm also eyeballing an Orange Pi 3, but I really don't know what exactly I'd need as far as performance. Anyone have ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m thinking of upgrading and updating my equipment that my family uses to stream media. We primarily use it for our kids but we are slowly building out our own library via EBay and dollar bins. 
 My thoughts were with the insane improvements to CPUs with the new generations that I should upgrade (first major upgrade ever). So… I need help thinking about what I should be purchasing. My ultimate goal is to build a multi-Blu-ray dvd drive chassis (about 4) in a 2U rack mount. Next I get a new generation intel CPU and partner this with the an intel ARC gpu for AV1 encoding. My hopes would be that I build out an overkill ripping machine that quickly rips and encodes any media put into it, as I have a few family friends who are willing to let me rip through their dvds and cds. I will put a 10G NIC to connect to a separate storage NAS that eventually will be what my media server runs off of whenever I get through this project. 
 So essentially I’m building a super quick overkill machine that when it is complete will be ripped apart (pun intended) and made into a 1U machine that will rip slower as I can wait for a dvd or two versus hundreds. Then I will use the high quality parts (I.e. the CPU in other machines even perhaps the media server for on the fly hardware encoding). 
 So I would love recommendations on what this dream machine will be? I am going in on this project with a few people so we are all going to share this ripping machine to quickly get through our media libraries. I ultimately end up with it all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For example, it seems like a video is 10 minutes long, but its actually 2 minutes long because its kind of corrupt (this is a recovered file). I can play the video using video regular players. After 2 minutes, it just ends. I get no error from the player.
 There are a few hundred unhealthy videos among a few thousand videos
 How can I bulk-check them?
 Goal: Identify unhealthy movies. Write their filename and folder info into a text file. Then remove the files

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've tried looking at this on the internet, but have found several conflicting answers. I'd like to use a 4tb or 8tb External HDD for some old video project files that I just don't need quick immediate access to. I'd just like to put it on there, and then forget about it until I maybe need it for something. Each video project with all assets is about 10gb.
 ​
 Not necessarily looking in to like a NAS or second pc or something like that.
 ​
 If I go through with this, would leaving it plugged in or unplugged be okay?

 So I made the tunnel and have the docker running on my NAS, which is also where my Overseerr docker is running.
 I added a public hostname pointing to my internal network at https://overseerr.mydomain.com, and pointed it to requests.mydomain.com.
 Whe I go to requests.mydomain.com I get a failed to find the page error.
 What am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like everyone else, I was crushed to hear about the Google Photos free photo update. I have been able to find workarounds, but I think it is time for me to get myself some self hosted photo/video app. 
 And to do so, I thought of getting a NAS and install LibrePhotos or Photoprism (I'd need to see how they work to choose for one) or to directly use the NAS photo management system.
 The problem is, the documentation in both Photoprism and LibrePhotos ask as a requirement 3/4GB of RAM, which is not that common to have on a NAS (and if you find it it's paying a hefty sum). So my question is double:
 Users of these applications, what NAS are you using and how well does it work?
 If I get a 2GB RAM NAS, can I later upgrade it myself with RAM modules, or is it soldered and impossible to upgrade? 
 Thanks!

 I've currently got 4x 8TB WD Reds in an ubuntu box with a raidz1 array, My original plan was to lift and shift the array into the new NAS, but I'm leaning more towards getting new drives and copying my data over, then I can migrate the drives and see if moving the pool would have worked.
 I can get 16TB IronWolf pros from my local MicroCenter for $280, and it looks like RaidZ expansion has yet to land, so I'm thinking I'd be best getting 4 drives up front and doing a raidz1. I guess I'm looking for a sanity check, if that's a good way forward for storing all my linux isos :D

I already have a VMware esxi server on a Dell r720 and a Plex server with 28TB on a old i5 6600K running all the ARRs as well (thinking of moving these to Docker, right now they're local installs). I had a 240gb and a 1TB SSD laying around. I installed Truenas on the 240gb. I noticed that I can't do anything with the excess space. So I wonder if is there a better way to run it. I hate wasting space I have several 1TB 2.5 SSDs laying around from various projects over the years I thought about buying a SATA card to run them off of too and use the 240 as a cache drive for the mechanicals. 
 What would be the best most efficient way to use TrueNAS? Would running from a USB slow it down while running? should I install it on a 32-128GB USB drive and run it that way? Bonus if you know a good place in the US to buy reliable used big storage HDD for cheap? I'd love to purchase some.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have a 4 tb NAS drive that I want to make an offline backup of. I have four 1TB drives and only one dock so only one drive can be attached to the system at a time. Is there an elegant way to start copying files to the 4tb drive to the first 1tb drive until it runs out of space, then wait till I swap it with an empty drive, and then keep copying, keeping track of all the drives needed to do this in order? I don't want the drives in RAID, because that would require plugging all of them in at once, and I also don't want one drive failing taking the data stored on all the other drives with it.
 Isn't this how tape drives work for storing huge drive arrays? It should be pretty standard archival practice right?
 Ideally, I don't want to have to fully reassemble the data to find something. I want to be able to plug in a drive, search around for what it contains out of the larger drive, and copy individual files back without doing a full restore. Though if an individual file is larger than any one drive, I'd like it to be split between the drives and then able to be reassembled. Also, if this can be done at the individual file level and written into any filesystem I want, that'd be even better since then I can take advantage of having the archival drives LUKS encrypted and also using filesystem level compression. 
 Is there a solution that can do all this? I use Linux if that makes a difference on works and what doesn't.

 What I want is an image of the disk I can restore in case something bad happens. But I can't unmount the partition while backing it up since there are critical applications running on it.
 Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I already have a Plex server with a 5 TB hard drive. But I am thinking of expanding up to 10 TB but I want some redundancy like perhaps having two 10 TB in maybe RAID 1 mirror mode. My idea is that have two hard drives one acting as a backup. Performance is not a concern since most movies don't go past 1080P and there are no more than 3 concurrent streams. I use a hp g800 mini which is serving quite well and I have had no complaints with streaming or content quality drops even in different countries. 
 Since performance isn't an issue my idea is I use Unix command line as the OS of the machine. The hard drives would be in NTFS format. I am wondering if there is any specific setup for this. Would I need some sort of NAS or a software solution that would be preferred without investing in additional hardware? Maybe someone has done something similar and could share a solution? 
 Much appreciated

CYA archiving. Through the years I've migrated through the "stack of floppies", "stack of 1/4" tapes", "stack of CDs" and "stack of DVDs". Is there anything that should stay current for the next decade? What (w/ proper storage) should last until it's time to migrate to the next "Latest & Greatest"? 
 It kinda seems that there is no longevity/cost-to-start/cost-to-maintain sweet-spot. M-Discs seem good longevity-wise, but they're expensive/TB and their individual capacity is a bit on the low side. Duplicate HDs are good on the cost/TB side, but how long would they last sitting in a firesafe once filled? LTO is great on the capacity and cost/TB, but start-up costs are very high and living through the floppy & 1/4" tape era, I'm leery about the longevity of tape in storage. 
 How reliable are refurbished LTO drives? They make the start-up costs more manageable, but how likely is a drive to clobber a tape and make it unreadable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a "problem" I've had for many years, on multiple systems, distros and so on that I can't really figure out and maybe there's just no solution to it.
 The problem is that when I write to a disk (a 8TB WD Red in this case) it completely tanks the read speeds of it. Trying to read a file from the disk during the write operation is almost impossible, for example trying to play a video file over samba will take 10 seconds to even start. The disk is happily writing at 150-170MB/s while at most I can get around 1MB/s trying to read something, almost as if the write operation gets complete priority. As soon as the write is done I'm back to full read speeds which is about 170MB/s.
 One consequences of this is that if someone is watching Plex and the particular file they are streaming resides on "disk1" and I need to copy some files to that disk at the same time, 'cp /mnt/disk2/file /mnt/disk1/file', the Plex stream is very likely to start buffering.
 To me it seems like a I/O scheduler issue but I've tried all of them with no success. Currently I'm using BFQ and not even ionice -c 3 is helping. It's also possible that this is just the nature of hard disks and there's no way to get around that, I don't know.
 Some info about my system:
  
OS: Arch Linux
 Kernel: 6.0.7-arch1-1
 Asus Prime H510M-K
 Intel i3-10100
 16GB of RAM (usually my usage is around 3-4GB)
 Disks directly connected to the motherboard
  
I experienced the same issue back when I was running WD Red 3TB disks on a completely different system and different distro (Debian) so I highly doubt it's an hardware issue.
 I'm running LUKS on the disks with BTRFS on top and then pooled with MergerFS. During my troubleshooting I'm copying files directly from one disk to another, bypassing MergerFS so that should have nothing to do with it.
 I have also played around with 'vm.dirty_ratio' and 'vm.dirty_background_ratio' but it makes no difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/DataHoarder
 Quite often have seen in comments that people suggest to move to HBA expansion cards for users who run bunch of HDDs, as this is more safe and provides more slots for those who run 8 or even more drives. By HBA, mean SAS HBA devices.
 My question would be - Why such devices are preferred in comparison to plugging many HDDs to SATA ports? 
 At the moment I have 6 drives connected, these already populate entire motherboard's available SATA ports. Also have an PCI Express SATA Controller Expansion Card (1 x PCIe X1 to 4 SATA), but currently there is no need in more slots. While on other hand probably I would like to expand drive pool later. Heard such cards are not recommended, because often cheaply built and can affect speeds as all drives will share single interface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say I have a CMS container, and a database container for the CMS, all running on a VPS called A and being served via Nginx, how would I load balance this?
 My first thought was to stop the containers running on VPS A, copy them to VPS B and simultaneously start up both containers on both VPSes. That sounds like round robin DNS, which (I think?) is supposed to be a load balancing method.
 But that doesn't sound sustainable at all, especially when I think that if I wrote a post on VPS A's CMS instance I'd need to copy it over by hand to the other running CMS instance.
 So how would I correctly load balance one running app to multiple servers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, just a question about UPS and if I’m on the wrong path. I have about 12 power supplies connected to two power outlets. My problem is that my breaker always flips if for example the power for our apartment goes out for some seconds. If I try to flip it back, I need to hold it down for 1-3 seconds otherwise it flips directly again. The power consumption is low, for all power supplies and the server it is about 120 Watt.
 If I would connect a UPS (Eaton USV Ellipse ECO 800 USB DIN for example) to my small homelab server and the power supplies the breaker problem should be solved or will the breaker of the PSU then blow if the PSU goes offline (power outage longer than battery)? Help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 Several of the applications / systems that I have (and no doubt others have) like to default to sending email for notifications. I'm fed up of email, much prefer using ntfy and all too often I set up a mail rule which hides a true positive because I've not thought the rule through :D
 I'm wondering if anyone has set up something like Mailu to effectively be an internal only email service which can then be monitored and alerted on another way?
 Or is there a better way to handle this?
 Ultimately I want to have a way for an application I self host, in my homelab network, to use SMTP to create whatever notification it wants on a service which is also inside my network. I have no desire to stand up a mail service which can email out to the wider internet. Then I want to use that to trigger alerting through whatever method (figure this out later... ?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for advice regarding HDD cache size. I'm planning on adding 2 drives to my linux server in a LVM Raid 0 configuration, it should match my existing raid5 in capacity (22tb usable). old raid 5 will become the backup volume, so no concern for data loss. LVM raid will allow me a on-the-fly conversion from raid 0 to 5 once I add a third disk. The server is used for many things, but 4k streaming via plex is the only real resource consuming thing (although we have only 1 stream at a time).
 WD Red Plus 12TB (256MB Cache) for €298,90 or €24,908/TB
 WD Red Plus 14TB (512MB Cache) for €373,98 or €26,713/TB
 Originally I had decided to get the WD Red Plus 12TB, but then I noticed that the 14TB has double the cache size. I'm not sure how strongly that would impact the performance and if it will be worth the extra 150€? Does anybody have any insights or opinions on that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone else have a concern that nginx-proxy-manager has been abandoned? The developer made it clear they were't going to work on version 2 anymore which i believe most users are utilizing. The reason that version 2 development stopped was to work on version 3. However it looks like there hasn't been commits in months.
 The version 3 status update looks quite concerning: https://github.com/NginxProxyManager/nginx-proxy-manager/discussions/1202. 
 If others have had the same concern I posed now, what did you choose to port to? I'm considering swag, but I have a cloudflare wildcard certificate being generated that I think may be an issue to port over to their framework.
 Side note, I'm grateful for the nginx-proxy-manager project and do not fault the developers or contributors if they don't have time to work on it or have other items they wish to focus on. This post is not intended to bash them. That project helped me dramatically in my self hosted journey. I will always feel appreciative for that project.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to have an inventory system. how I see my interaction with it:
  
I create an entity, i.e. "Toothpaste".
 I use my phone to scan my fav toothpaste's barcode, and it assigns scanned barcode to that entity.
 I repeat adding another N entities.
 later I open that app, hit 'restock' button or whatever. scan N different objects with corresponding entities already existing. and it increments stored counters for those entities.
 later I open that app, hit 'withdraw' button or whatever. scan N different objects with corresponding entities already existing. and it decrements stored counters for those entities.
  
I don't really need any integrations. Only one I'd appreciate is sending notifications when certain items hit some count threshold. I also thought about purchasing a barcode scanner, but really thought that phone can do the same (even if slower) and it should be easier to implement. many thanks for any help.
 all other solutions I found require you to print codes, but I really want to use existing ones.

There's some concern for his wellbeing in the 3d community here on Reddit as his last couple of videos have had some statements in them that have a few people speculating.
 For those who aren't in the 3D world, his tutorials were some of the best, most specific and most useful tutorials out there for beginners and professionals alike converting everything from basics to very in depth modelling across various pieces if software .
 Has anyone got an archive? Was anyone backing up? If would be a huge blow to the 3D community to lose this knowledge. He was essentially used like a reference guide for generalists and 3D modellers and basically anyone as a hobbyist it a professional will either know the username if have unknowingly followed one of his tutorials. It's a big BIG loss if this content is gone forever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been exploring several options to accomplish this but I'm struggling to find info on some specific things, and which solution would work best in my case.
 Instead of rambling about every little thing I've googled recently, Im just going to list what I'd hope to secure.
 I hoping to have SSO for as much as possible, 2FA for everything, and I'd prefer to continue using NGINX Proxy Manager.
  
Synology NAS. I heavily utilize many of the Synology packages, and I'd like to have SSO and 2FA. I'm fairly confident this should be relatively easy. But I have found very little info on how it will interact with the iOS apps, and the desktop clients for some of the apps. Since they are designed to use the auth built in to the Synology, how will they work with an external SSO server? I have read it can be done, but I can find no info on how it actually works and what it looks like on the users end. 
 WebDAV, SMTP & IMAP. I have found so much conflicting information on these. Apparently many people just bypass them, but I'd rather not. I have seen mention of a way to enable 2FA for apps that dont support it by adding the TOTP code to the end of the password when logging in. But is that even the correct or best way? any gotchas? 
  
There is more that I would hope to secure, but I've been able to find decent info on the rest. 
 It's looking like Authelia is the app of choice right now, but I've also been looking at Keycloak, and Authentik. I'm Open to any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all! Hopefully this is a relative sub to post this on. I recently acquired a Netgear ReadyNAS 516 for free and started tinkering around with it. I'm pretty much looking to make a Plex Media server. I got it up and running, everything works, actually doing a few mods, upgrading the RAM from 4gb to 16GB and changing the i3 3220 CPU to the Xeon 1265L V2, just waiting for that stuff to come in the mail. As of right now, its working fine and actually having lots of fun with it.
 With that being said. Its discontinued, no more updates, possible security downsides etc. My buddy has been telling me a lot about UNRAID and how its superior - even though the ReadyNAS 516 is working great for me right now.
 What I'm thinking of trying to accomplish: Bypass my original ReadyNAS OS 6 / firmware, and run Unraid. its already an X86 system, so it CAN run windows, etc. only downside, whenever it reboots, it defaults and resets the bios settings so if I change the boot order and actually get something else on it auto reverts after every reboot and tries to load its OS 6.x.x . I can't figure out how to make it stop, not sure if its built into the bios or some soldered on memory chip that makes it do that (default boot is to USB uefi but I can't find any place where that is on the hardware itself).
 Was wondering if anyone has any expertise, or opinions or suggestions. I'll do my best to answer any questions anyone has about this as I'm not super familiar with this as of right now since Its pretty new to me.
 Thanks All!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/selfhosted! I'm a co-founder of Metlo (https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo). Excited to share what we’ve been working on for the last couple months. Metlo is a self hosted, open source API security platform that inventories, tests and protects your API endpoints.
 - We inventory your endpoints by scanning API traffic and detecting all your endpoints along with the sensitive data they contain
 - We generate information your security team may find useful like Open API Specs and risk scores for each endpoint
 - After this we discover vulnerabilities like unauthenticated endpoints returning sensitive data or missing HSTS headers
 - Finally Metlo detects any anomalous behavior on sensitive endpoints in real time so you can detect 0-day attacks as they're happening
 We have a sandbox for you to play around with here http://demo.metlo.com/. Also, Here's a demo video if you would like a quick walk through of the product :)
 https://www.loom.com/share/349c9e5f267741e9a0fcd2dfd1f9956f
 We’d really appreciate your feedback and ideas, and are happy to answer any questions!
 EDIT: We - me and my cofounder. We'll be monitoring this post for a while! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm no expert, but I do have knowledge on how to work around. Right now I'm stuck on how would I be able to solved this situation. If I'm not explaining myself very well, I apologize thanks in advanced.
 Here is the situation:
 I have a TrueNAS that I use for video editing workflow and other projects. I already have my main client PC connected 10GbE via peer-to-peer ( its been working perfectly fine for over 3 years). I also have a Macbook Pro connected via 10GbE.
 Now I'm in the middle of too many lights at night lighting up since is in my bedroom, honestly I can not handle this anymore. I live in a rent apartment that is fully wired with cat6 cables that I patched myself actually. Problem is I can not run more cables, I have no permission from the Landlord.
 My main connection from ISP, and router is on my daughter's bedroom closet, and I can not fit my TrueNAS there. The only place I do have space and permission from my wife to put, is in the living room. I also have a few Raspberry Pis and a few external driver for backup that are going to be moved over the living room. I also need to simplify the space I'm occupying on my bedroom.
 From my daughter's room there is 4x cat6 cable that goes to my bedroom, my son's bedroom, my daughter's bedroom and living room. That's for the regular internet connection, I can not put a 10GbE switch in the there( daughter's bedroom closet) because that would be a waste of hardware.
 I don't mind spend a little on 2x 10GbE switch of possible like either one of these 2:
 MikroTik
 QNAP
 I want to have separate connection on my client PC, 10GbE just for the TrueNAS connection and my regular internet connection just like the peer-to-peer connection. Same goes for the TrueNAS, I have my GUI and rest of the house client PC connect via 1GbE and just my editing PC and my Macbook (which is use just to back up my TrueNAS).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been too busy with life the last decade to play with computers, but free time has re-entered my life, and I recently got a server to start learning things with. I discovered I have an extra internet connection while putting it in my closet, and then after getting proxmox setup, and trying to setup a dynamic dns service for the domain I bought, I realized my home router also had a private IP address.
 Both connections have the same public IP of *.*.254.228, and tracert shows 4 hops between the device I connect with, to a public IP that is very similar, one more within my ISP, then out into the internet.
 Between my device and the ISP are:
 1 10.32.9.1 (10.32.9.1)
 2 192.168.89.1 (192.168.89.1
 3 172.16.254.1 (172.16.254.1)
 4 *.*.com (*.*.166.225)
 So after a little digging I'm wondering if what I'm dreaming up is possible.
 Link aggregation on pfsense, with a split SSH tunnel on each connection, that connects to a VPS server with a static IP my domain will point at, that runs a proxy server that points subdomains to my services, and balances the load down each connection.
 I could do all these things on their own, and would put more effort into the details of link aggregation and reverse proxies as they are the only new things I'm working with, but I decided to throw a question out here before I spend hours digging around to find it's not possible to do all together like I'm thinking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I do apologize if this is not the right subreddit, but since this is an issue I came across while organizing my NAS contents, I thought someone here may help, and I do believe after all, this is effectively about archival of files.
 I'm currently running a script in a directory structure containing various video files and encodes everything in an x265 MKV file. I thought that the only file present would be mov or mp4, but it turns out there were two jpg files too.
 The funny thing, is that HandBrake CLI actually crated an MKV file for those without complaining, and reduced the file size from 3MB to 400KB. Opening it with VLC just flashes the image for a second, while other media players keep the frame, I didn't do any quality analysis, but at first glance the quality seem similar (consider that the picture quality wasn't great to begin with, and I'm with the size being reduced even if lossy)...
 Now, aside the fact that for sure there is a way to make a much better JPG and shrink the file size while still being a JPG, has anybody ever actually used x265 for image compression? Seems pretty ridiculous, but I'm kind of curious about it.
 Clearly thought, an image cannot just stay inside an MKV container, it's too much of a pain.
 Sorry for the weird question and thanks in advance!

 ​
 I am in need to build a nas that i will be using for editing off and cloud work for others to access to remotely. I am thinking about using the Iron wolf pro 16-20tb. Running in RAID 6 or RAID Z2 not sure yet. Not sure as to what hardware would be a great option to run. Do i need m2 ssd for catche, will that speed up the workflow and media streaming and if so how much to make a difference, 1tb ? 2tb ? one or two m2 ssd ? I know there is plently of guys on here who are smarter than me when it comes these things and i would highly appricate a helping hand. Thinking about adding a Lsi Logic 9201-16i 16port 6gb/S too for more sata drives to be added and as well use the case Define R5 case as it seems perfect for a large NAS build.

The intent is to have a few ports accessible to the world, and everything else blocked. I wanted the portainer website (port 9000) to only be accessible if I VPN to the wireguard docker app that's on the server (that is, accessible only by the server's IP address). Here are the rules:
 action,protocol,port,source
 accept,ssh,22,0.0.0.0/0
 accept,TCP(HTTP),80,0.0.0.0/0
 accept,TCP(HTTPS),443,0.0.0.0/0
 accept,TCP,9000,server.ip/32 #portainer
 accept,UDP,51820,0.0.0.0/0 #vaultwarden
 drop,any,0-65535,0.0.0.0/0 #default
 ​
 Racknerd doesn't seem to have a firewall page on the webui. I don't have much experience with setting up a firewall on server (CentOS / Alma Linux 8). Could anyone point me to how to achieve these rules? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've got a relatively power-efficient hypervisor I am running to host VMs currently, and am for the most part happy with it. The problem is that single-core performance is relatively weak, so when things get busy on a single-threaded game server (such as building large farms in Minecraft), things can start getting laggy.
 Separately, I have been considering upgrading to the newer Intel 13-series on my desktop PC for the higher single-thread performance offered, which would make CAD applications like Fusion 360 more responsive.
 The thought of combining these two projects just occurred to me. The general idea would be to install Proxmox on bare metal, and allocate the dGPU, USB ports, and potentially the storage device(s), to my PC VM.
 Based on what I've read online, one of the concerns would be that some games' anti-cheat systems don't like being run in a VM. However, I've also seen some people mentioning that this concern is overblown as there are relatively few games this is an issue with (such as Valorant, which I have no interest in playing).
 My question:
  
Just how many games would actually have an issue with being run in a VM? I'm not much of a gamer nowadays, but on those rare occasions a friend convinces me to join them, I don't want to worry about being unable to play.
 
Are there any foreseeable performance limitations you are aware of? (other than just the additional CPU/RAM usage of whatever other VMs I am running alongside it)
 
Any other potential issues?
 
 Thank you

 I also have a question about self-hosting in general. Let's say that I've been uploading all of my photos to something like PhotoPrism using my own server. If something happens to my server, will I still have access to the photos that I've uploaded?

 These days, I've been looking for some solutions with my data, only cloud oriented after a bad experience with a NAS. My idea now is to select a Cloud provider in order to have a +1 secure backup between all my PCs, but the main interest for me would be to finally get a nice file Synchronisation solution for all my files that I use between my PCs.
 I've ended up doing a Google Sheet based on many, many, many providers. I used all the feedback from here to make it, so thanks again <3
 Yeah... I didn't have anything else to do, and went for a basic setup, it's ugly
 In the end, only Syncthing isn't Cloud based. But no matter what, it's an useful tool that i'll keep as a bonus tool anyway haha.
 As you can see, Filen is really getting the lead for me. But as in the bad points, my biggest fear is the Life Time Scam.
 So I wanted to know if anybody used Filen and have a good experience with the Life Time thing ? What about OneDrive and Sync which are still perfect tools for my need ?
 Thanks a lot !

Then I came across the Klein VDV226-110, which only works with pass-through connectors. A pack of 200 Klein VDV826-763 pass-trough connectors are $55 on Amazon, which is definitely more expensive than your average RJ45 connector. I have never used pass-through connectors, but they do seem easier to use. Is it worth the extra cost switching to pass-through?

 I've tried things like Httrack and the like, and the critical function of actually generating the statblocks doesn't seem to work, and I'm way out of my depth here. I'm straight up at the point where I'd be willing to throw money at the issue to get this done. I've dug into any and all alternatives, and there are none that really do what this site does. Sites, apps, I've looked all over. The only alternative is foundry vtt, and that would cost me over 50 bucks and would pale in comparison to the options this website provides for free

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just showing off but I thought this might be useful to people who own several hundred GB of comics. I use it to repack high quality manga on my Kobo, it more than doubled the amount I can store at once.
 I know such repacking software already exists because people post on manga sites all the time, but I couldn't find any scripts online, much less ones that were easy to use. This tries to fill that niche, letting you do bulk operations on entire folders.
 Obvious disclaimer that lossy compression is technically always, well, lossy, but based on my testing the tradeoff is very favorable (though lossless WebPs are basically a free improvement over PNG, as long as you're okay with using WebP). While this *can* be used to make images look like a potato, the defaults produce files which are indistinguishable to the source, unless you zoom into individual pixels.
 The thing with CBZ files (which are essentially just a ZIP image folder by a different name), is that many publishers use the JPEG format with parts of the compression algorithm disabled, which while good for distribution, provides little benefit to end users, and by re-enabling those parts you can get free space savings without degrading image quality at all.
 This applies to JPEG images broadly, and this utility can be used for that too (bulk conversion of images), although there are probably better options available.

 version: '3.3' services: app: image: matrixdotorg/synapse restart: always ports: - 8008:8008 volumes: - /var/docker_data/matrix:/data 
 With the proper nginx config it runs perfectly.
 Enter the matrix facebook bot. I am missing something and I don't know where to start. 
 Following the manual, I first added the bot compose to my existing compose, resulting to this:
 version: '3.3' services: app: image: matrixdotorg/synapse restart: always ports: - 8008:8008 volumes: - /var/docker_data/matrix:/data mautrix-facebook: container_name: mautrix-facebook image: dock.mau.dev/mautrix/facebook:latest restart: unless-stopped volumes: - ./mautrix-facebook:/data 
 I ran docker-compose up -d and the config was created. In the config I changed homeserver address to https://matrix.example.com, homeserver domain to matrix.example.com, database address to /data/homeserver.db and appservice address to https://mautrix-facebook:29319. This last part is the one I am most doubtful about, and I have found very little info on it online. 
 Then, I reran the container and the registration file was generated. I copied it to /var/docker_data/matrix and edited my homeserver.yaml with the following:
 app_service_config_files: - /data/registration.yaml 
 Then, I restarted the container and the facebookbot user was not created. I know that because it didn't show up in the users' list at synapse admin. 
 I do not know what I am doing wrong and I would appreciate some help.

All of a sudden, starting two days ago, I wasn’t able to connect to my Wireguard VPN container on my server, and even when I made a handshake, no website would load on the client machine. My home assistant container has not been responding in HomeKit anymore either. The uptime kuma logs, both from uptime kuma and from my telegram bot are included in the links below. It’s also worth mentioning that my docker containers are not restarting, as they show to be running even when uptime kuma says they are down. Does anyone know why this might be happening?
 So far, I have tried restarting my router (I use FiOS) and rebooting the server, but neither has fixed the problem.
 Something else to add is that the telegram bot never shows the down notifications, it only shows the up notifications.

 I've made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure - hence this post here.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn't cover Kubernetes or similar - I'm of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don't need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can't be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you've never even heard of Docker, if you don't know at least something about DNS, or if you don't have any experience with…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi :)
 I'm starting freelancing as an engineer, and I work for a few clients wich gave me an internal addresse on their servers. As it is, I have currently 4 professional emails I need to check and reply frequently, which is bothersome to handle.
 I could use Gmail to handle this : setup a Gmail account, import the 4 addresses on it. I can receive all the mails (POP3), send as any of the addresse, when I reply it automatically choose which addresse to use, and have a custom signature for each addresse. And everything is synced with the mobile App. Easy. I do this for my personal addresses. Now it's google, privacy is an issue for work ... I have a home server, I'd like to have my own Gmail equivalent at home.
 I could use a desktop client, like thunderbird, but I use different computers, different networks, I need everything in a single place, I don't want to manager different thunderbirds configs, and some emails are deleted when pulled with POP3, so I would only have them at one place ...
 Email forwarding would be easy, but I need to reply as the mail it was sent to, so I need multiple smtp ...
 I reviewed a few webmails to handle things:
 - Roundcube : only one account. I did not find a way to setup roundcube to centralise multiple accounts like gmail does. Maybe there is ?
 - Zimbra : I found it can pull email from different accounts, but sending using using different SMTP accounts for each addresse doesn't seem to be a thing.
 I really did'nt find any other webmail that could, like gmail, centralise different adresses on different server, send and receive from and as each of them, each it's own signature, with an android app to sync with.
 Do you guy know any webmail that could do that ? How do you guys handle multiple emails accounts without a desktop client ?
 ​
 Thank you for your time, any help or tips would be appreciated :)

This includes basic things like voice calls and video. Am I missing something? I was really bummed out because the UI was decent enough, but every click is like “upgrade to enterprise”. Is there not free jitsi integration or anything? 
 More of a question and not a rant, aside from requirements around connecting into their commercial cloud bullshit to even enable plugins at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm hoping to get some help and advice.
 I'm part of a community on Twitter who are anxious about the change in ownership and are looking elsewhere to continue. We're about 500-1000 members at the moment. I've warned them that if we move we'll have to pay for a server, but the majority are willing to chip in $1 a month.
 I have been looking into Mastodon, Misskey and Pleroma as alternatives, but I am unsure which one to go for.
 For those who know these pieces of software, I'm wondering about the following:
 1: How easy to install and maintain? I have basic experience of Docker, but not much more.
 2: I would be running this in a VPS, what would be the system requirements for these running 500 users and at running 1000 users? What sort of monthly costs should I expect?
 Not really self-hosting questions, but if anyone has answers:
 3: These are people who have only used Twitter, which is the simplist to migrate to in terms of UI?
 4: Many of their friends have already left for Mastodon. I read that Misskey and Pleroma can still connect and read Mastodon, but how does this work? Surely some features won't work? Would I be safer in just choosing Mastodon?
 5: Planning to raise funds for server upkeep via liberapay, good or bad idea?
 Thanks for any assistance you can give, I really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was slowly archiving things in a couple niche areas, about 25tb so far. The shut down of the library made me realize I need to step it up. I miss the old demonoid still, used to collect 1000s of old books there, irreplaceable now, and I'll never get the rest I think sadly. So many other trackers are just gone. I'm building a large offline archive of useful stuff for the niche I exist in. I have access to decent bandwidth now but I'll be fully off grid within a year or so. Collecting From Wikipedia to full copies of a couple trackers to some site copies via wget. That take down made me realize I need too get at it. I'm thinking either 4 bay nas or a small 8 bay server. I liked the serverparts price on 18tb, but the pricing at best buy is not great. I'll likely use the drives as main drives for 2-3 years then upgrade and turn them to offline backups and scrap/sell my 1/2tbs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Maybe most here have a different idea of data hoarding but in essence I think the idea is similar. Basically I don't want my knowledge lost. I hate having to reresearch and rediscover things over and over. So I started my own wiki where I deposit all the fruits of my research. 
 I picked PmWiki over MediaWiki because it uses simple flat files to store data so no database is needed to run it, just php. It can also easily be run offline. My site is https://naturevault.org and has an auto github archive every 8 hours at https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault
 It is cool having a flat file wiki cause it can be backed up via git and I just do a 'git pull' on my pc to back up the github archive. Right now it is 1500 pages and only about 10 mb and it probably contains more data than my brain is holding lol.
 So my best thought is that ideally "everyone" would have their own wiki like this and then we sync our wikis so that each of our wikis contain copies of each other's wikis. It is organized in groups so my wiki group is naturevault and your wikigroup would be whatever you wanted to call it. It is the original 'wiki federation' idea by the creator of the wiki.
 Does this sort of thing appeal to anyone, or is the idea of just personal private data storage all that this group really cares about? For me I am into the "library of alexandria" idea.
 Another idea is I could release a blank version of my wiki with no pages so you can use it as a template for your own personal private data storage, if there is interest I could maintain a github archive of that. I have put hundreds+ of hours into tuning PmWiki to be great.
 Anyway glad to have stumbled upon this group! Excited to learn more of how people are backing up their life.

 Normally, chkdisk could, could solve the issue. But not in my case, right? Since the file system is encrypted. What do I do? Do I delete the files? What about the missing folder? How do I delete the missing folder?
 I have backups. Do I restore from that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I currently run a Synology NAS for data backup, with some services mainly on Docker. Nothing is exposed to the Internet, everything runs behind a VPN.
 Now I would like to tinker with some services that need to be joined over the Internet (ie: some test websites, Wallabag, reverse proxy with Authelia...), probably in Docker as well.
 I wouldn't like to run them directly on my NAS because:
  
I care about my personal data,
 From my experience, there are too many security flaws in Docker images we didn't think about before exposing them to the world,
 Docker on Synology is so outdated anyway that I don't trust it.
  
​
 From my readings, the next step for me was buying a NUC/Tinyminimicro/whatever and setting some containers reading data from a dedicated NFS folder on my NAS.
 But I'll just run a few services, the machine would idle most of the time and add 10-15W to my electricity bill.
 ​
 So now I'm thinking about running publicly exposed services in a VM running on my NAS:
  
This one has enough RAM & CPU to handle a few services in a VM so it's more power-efficient,
 Public services would run with or without Docker, but on the VM,
 Important data would be accessed via NFS (even if it's the same physical machine) on a specific folder, so it would be easier to backup,
 If a service is attacked, the data would be backed up (replication, distant backup, and so on). At worst, my VM is killed but it's no big deal.
  
​
 If I resume my idea, I want to add a layer (the VM) for better isolation between my public services and my NAS.
 Do you think it's secure enough for most attacks, or I shouldn't trust the VM isolation and buy a different physical machine?
 ​
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a proxmox host running for almost two years now. I have setup almost everything by hand. Now that I have learned about Terraform and Ansible, I want to start from scratch and script everything.
 I want to be able to destroy all VMs and rebuilding automatically using the scripts, however I want to preserve the data. So in my Terraform script I want to define disks using a ID, if that ID doesn't exists in Proxmox it should create it, and if it does exists do nothing. Then I can define my VMs and reference to the specific disks. Then using Ansible I mount the disks using the same ID.
 I have looked into the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox but I don't see anything for creating the disk outside the VM. I'm also not sure how to set any ID for a disk and use that to mount in /etc/fstab. So I'm wondering if my idea even is possible?
 In the end I want to use Docker and Portainer to run everything, and every Docker Stack will have it's own disk(volume mounted to specific disk). This makes backing up data easier to manage, also some disks/volumes/containers I want to encrypt.
 Can someone point me in the right direction?

Kleopetra does this (gnupgp) but for some reason, it fails for files above 2 Gigabytes. Simply creating checksum files is useless if I cannot use them to verify data.
 Edit: Found a solution Thanks to u/xlltt
 https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab is exactly what I was looking for. Although I haven't tested larger files (512GB+) with it, it works nicely with my current setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I just got my first piece of homelab hardware yesterday and installed ProxMox into it without major issue. After setting it up, I went to upgrades and refreshed/updated everything, I was also able to set up a VM running a minecraft server with LinuxGSM, and I'm able to connect through the VMs local IP, however when I try to access it using my public IP I can't find it. I know for sure the VM can talk to the router as I can ping it from the VM and was able to download files from the internet. I spun up another ubuntu server VM with an apache webserver to see if I had the same issue and it's the same thing, I can connect through the local IP but can't connect using my public IP.
 I thought it had something to do with my port forwarding setup in my router, however I port forwarded a factorio server to a virtualbox VM running in my laptop and that worked fine so I'm pretty sure it has something to do with my ProxMox or VM settings. Not really sure where to go from now, I'm concerned that maybe leaving the DNS and Gateway settings as default during ProxMox installation is causing these issues?
 Would appreciate any help or tips on how to debug this :)

 I run a few internal services in my homelab (Grafana, HomeBridge etc) and it is a bit annoying that when I surf to them I get the "Not Secure" warning since I do not have an SSL certificate for them. It also means my password manager asks an extra question before it fills in username and password.
 I would love to fix this without having to obtain an SSL certificate. Does anyone have any solutions for this?
 Thanks!

I'm just Looking to possibly migrate my unraid over to it but not sure what hardware I might need to make it happen. I have something like 80 TB running a chia coin farm, media server, and a few other services. I see from some googling that Dell says max drive sizes are 1 or 2 TBs using the onboard 6i SAS RAID Controller installed. Is there something I can buy that would let me hook up 10-20 sata hard drives that isn't raid? I think the biggest ones I have are 16 TB. Thanks r/homelab! You guys are next level =)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys!
 I have some files in my Plex that have multiple audios and subtitles language. I'm one of those that prefer to watch anything in their original language and use subs instead of dubs, and I was getting bothered on how for every episode I had to change the audio from English to Japanese for some anime (24 episodes, and each episode I had to change the language).
 This is what I found, this little beautiful project done by cglatot. You can bulk select by season, series...etc and select the default for audio and sub for it. It looks like it hasn't been updated for a while but it works perfectly fine. You can selfhost it or use the hosted version.
 I wanted to share it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Received one with a i5 and 16gb ram from my parents while they were in town. It doesn't have wireless and I don't see a reason to spend on the wireless components to put it somewhere around my house, so I figured maybe there would be a cool use case for it in my rack. So far, my homelab is pretty basic. Unraid server with the Arrs, plex, and supporting docker stuff for media. Cloudkey gen2 for my cams and access points. 24port ubiquiti poe switch. R210ii running pfsense and it's adguard. Pretty much sums it up.
 I'm wondering if there is some cool use case for this little guy short of selling it or making it a garage pc. Some sort of homelab use I'm overlooking despite not having a smart home for all that stuff.
 Thanks all, from a rookie.

All I could find about it is that it's a top level domain (TLD) but that didn't explain if it's fine the way it is or if some setting is off. I checked the DNS settings and added the cloudflare DNS servers for IPv4 and IPv6 but that didn't change anything either.
 I ran AGH a couple of months ago with the same settings and didn't have this issue. Not sure what's different this time.
 Any advice appreciated. Thank you!

I'm assuming it'll mainly just fail to run at the specified speed due to the NICs having to deal with higher than normal packet corruption?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got a rack-mount chassis + motherboard with 12 3.5 hard drive slots. I obviously am going to be getting the rest of the components but the price of hard drives is overwhelmingly more expensive than anything I could get for the server, excluding tossing out the motherboard and getting a new system entirely. I have more or less seen that exos drives are the best value for the money and have decent Linux support. 
 I am not sure what operating system would be best for this kind of server but I am planning to go with Ubuntu server for now. If you know of a good one and have a link to a guide, feel free to let me know. It is mostly going to be Torrenting, NASing, and acting as a media server. So that is the kind of workload that the drives are going to be doing. 
 I am not sure what the best hard drives to get right now. I see drives on places like New Egg, where the default sellers have the drive for sale at 260, and then there are cheaper new sellers for 200 and so on. So I can maybe get a deal there but for market price drives, what are good? Are refurbished okay? Are there particular capacities to avoid? I am kind of looking for at least 100TB, preferably 150TB. That being said, I can deal with smaller capacity for now and get one of those 60 drive behemoths a couple years later. I would rather get something decent to start though.

 I have a plethora of docker containers running things like NPM, Jellyfin, Adguard, Nextcloud, Uptimekuma, and a couple of Minecraft servers. My issue is accessing them from outside the network. I have a VPS acting as a gateway and using Iptables to forward all traffic through a Wireguard tunnel into the LXC the docker container I have NPM running in and this setup has been working for the better part of a year. However, I believe an update has changed something and broken this but I was late in realizing the cause so I did some destructive changes on the VPS and for some reason, the backups were not working...

 Or what would be the best option for 150 drives Chia farming on its own and I could split off the rest of my 20 drives on their own. (No raid, as data can all be replaced with re-plotting).

I've been using Ubuntu Server (and Docker with Portainer) cause that's what mots sources I did my research from have been using plus I already use linux so I already knew my way around and also because linux is pretty easy to run on any hardware.
 I intend to self host pretty much anything I can, my own cloud for file storage that I can access from any of my devices, a media server, a music server, game servers, pihole, bitwarden and maybe a little file share for my friends so we can share large files over discord.
 I've heard that some people use Proxmox, FreeNAS or TrueNAS but is that because of their preference or are there any benefits besides convenience of not having to set up RAID and some other things manually and if I were to use them would I still be able to run all the other apps on top of it with docker?
 I'm sorry if this is a common or stupid question, I'm really having trouble finding the answer I'm looking for but I might just be searching for the wrong questions.

There's a huge influx of fakes here, even HDDs are fake, they put a memory card on it with something to make it heavier, I'm traumatized at this point.
 So I plan to buy from a US shop, need help to pick one.
 The contenders are:
 SanDisk from Western Digital: https://www.westerndigital.com/products/memory-cards/sandisk-ultra-uhs-i-microsd#SDSQUAC-256G-GN6MA
 Microcenter: https://www.microcenter.com/product/657911/micro-center-premium-256gb-microsdxc-card-uhs-i-flash-memory-card-c10-u3-v30-a1-micro-sd-card-with-adapter
 and the cheapest
 Silicon Power from bhp: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1536564-REG/silicon_power_sp256gbstxbv1v20sp_256gb_elite_a1_uhs_1.html
 They also have SanDisk: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1593902-REG/sandisk_sdsqua4_256g_an6ma_ultra_256gb_120mbs.html
 Those shops seem to be the most legit I've found, any suggestions?

At some point during the home’s existence, it was split into two apartments and we have a laundry closet downstairs and upstairs. I’ve gotten the okay to turn the downstairs closet into a server/electronics room. 
 I plan on putting a rack in there, along with my TV tuner for the house, and whatever equipment our new ISP provides us with. 
 The room is a pretty standard laundry closet - you could fit a stacked washer and dryer in there - has a 240V outlet and a 120V outlet. The water supply has been capped and cut off. And there is a vent that goes outside. 
 Does anybody have any sort of guidance for this setup? Can I use the vent for the routing of wires outside (or even for ventilation) - is there maybe an adapter or something for repurposing this vent?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was recently given four of these 5.25" hot swap bays from my workplace. As I already have an old case, fan and PSU, I'd like to build a cheapo DAS setup.
 USB to SATA enclosures are all over the place, so I assumed it would be straightforward to find the standalone adapters or break-out board I'd need. Not so, it would seem!
 Cables like these are available and fine for 2.5" drives, but unsuitable for 3.5" drives as I'd be powering them separate from the data cable. On the other hand, cables like this require an external barrel plug for power, which I'd have to duplicate four times. Ideally, I'd like to manage power with my PSU using the paperclip method.
 Are there any USB-C to SATA3 adapter boards on the market? Aliexpress, Amazon and eBay are failing me.
 Probably the best option I found was this adapter, but it looks to be long out of manufacture.
 If not, what do you think is the best approach here?
 Thanks for the advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Finally releasing something to the wild that I think is actually legitimately useful: oci-registry, a lightweight implementation of the OCI Registry spec with filesystem and S3 storage back-ends.
 Features
  
Pull-through cache for any registry, not just docker.io
  
This includes private, authenticated registries. This means that you can create an unauthenticated mirror of a private registry and expose it to the Internet. Easily. Don't do that.
 
 Two storage back-ends
  
S3
 Local filesystem
 
 Small footprint; in my test system, the official registry uses approximately 130 MiB of memory to mirror docker.io; five replicas of oci-registry combined use approximately 60 MiB to mirror everything in example.yaml, plus one private registry. CPU is negligible for both.
 A helm chart
  
Why?
 A few weeks back, I had a need to setup local mirrors of $dayjob's private registry. I didn't have much luck making this work with the official registry, so I decided to make this. While I was at it, I decided to make it do everything I wanted in a registry mirror.
 Rather than copy the rest of the README into a Reddit post, I'll end it here for comments/questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So will be easier to explain with an example.
 I had 5TB, currently adding another 9TB.
 E.g
 Files will be split between multiple drives:
  
1TB NVME SSD
 2 TB Hard Drive CMR
 3 TB Hard Drive SMR
 8 TB Hard Drive SMR
  
Lets say I want to split my Folders, Files, Steam and Movie Library between all drives.
 And lets make it more complicated by saying certain files require either the SSD or CMR drive.
 The 2 SMR drives are for files that don't require constant access or fast read/write speeds. 
 I Don't want to merge drives into 1 mass storage array.
 I will organize everything with speed and read/write access mind.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Now, currently my solution is adding shortcuts to to every folder in every drive.
 But that is becoming extremely messy. Every folder has 6 shortcuts that link and link back to every file.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ​
 Is there a better way to organize and access everything?
 There has to be like eg Local Client software that is light weight and can select multiple drives as a source to display and organize multiple files.
 Kind of like Plex or Adobe Bridge except I want to link and organize files across multiple storage drives.
 ​
 What I basically want to do is:
 Organize and Link Folders/Files across Multiple Drives in a client/root directory or software that gives me fast access to files regardless of where they are stored.
 Files/Folders added across multiple drives are displayed together regardless of source and can be opened from 1 central location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been kicking around an idea of implementing an electronic key card system for 2FA on my home network and possibly access control via electronic door locks. Mostly I want to do this based on some things I've seen at work going wrong and I was hoping to prototype or at least get an idea how much it would take to home grow a usable system without blowing our budget. 
 I believe the access control system should be vlan-ed off from the regular network, but it would need to get updates from a domain controller when access is removed for an individual.
 The system needs to be independent of any cloud services and cannot rely on any internet based token generators due to the system needing to work in the event of communications failure.
 I'm thinking RFID or NFC based cards, because they are cheap to obtain and encode.
 Anyone have experience that can point me in a useful direction? 
 I'd like to stick to open source if possible because this is a side project semi-related to work and I don't have a lot of disposable income to throw at it. I just want to build the system and see what kind of dependencies are required to get an idea how much smoke is being blown by security vendors.
 Thanks in advance for any recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before the JRE went to Spotify, I know there were at least one or two people who had his whole podcast history backed up. That made sense because it was something that existed prior to him moving to Spotify. What about since? 
 I've been interested in checking out Hideo Kojima's Brain Structures, but they have it completely locked down. Some other podcast had mentioned "pro tip, use Google Podcasts if you don't want to use Spotify" yet for the life of me I can't figure out how to do that. I've seen a ton of Spotify downloaders out there (r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH has a lot of info) but all of the ones I tried were either down or didn't work. 
 Have people actually been archiving Spotify exclusive podcasts? I see almost no requests for them anywhere, no matter where I look. Just genuinely suprised.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. So, I have a bunch of hard drives laying around that are full of data. I got no space in my computer so, i'm just doing some research on keeping hard dives offline and what the recommendtaions are to ensure the data is protected over the long term.
 For safe storage of the drives the interwebs say:
  
Store the drives at room temp somewhere where it cant be dropped!
 Avoid storing the drives in any moisure or damp areas.
 Put them in anti-static durable cases.. Ive brought these cases and they seem very good.
  
But what do you guys do to protect the data on these drives?
 From what I know the data is stored on these drives magnetically so I guess another thing for storage is not store them next to big magnets or speakers? 
 If a drive is sitting on shelf long term, can the data degrade if they are not used. Can they develop bitrot if they are not plugged in? 
 And if so, to prevent this, should we be periodically putting these drives back in a computer? ..and if thats the case, what commands are you guys running to check the disk? (and prevent bitrot)
 Also, how frequently should we be doing this? ..every 3 months? ..every 6 months? ..every year? 
 How many of you guys are storing drives offline like this? And have you ever lost any data this way due to bad storage or data getting corrupted somehow.
 Thanks in advance.

 You can find the address by running a simple lspci command. Should be something like 01:00.0
 So the final command with the load of info I'm looking for would look like
 lspci -vv -s 01:00.0

 If somebody can spare a minute to help, would be greatly appreciated.

 Unfortunately, UDP connections are completely blocked and OpenVPN drops even on port 443.
 normally I'd do some research on my own but I'm a little stressed out so I'd appreciate any direction I can get right now.

 My website is in .php and Webcopy does a good job of converting .php into .htm. And I want .htm so I can browse it offline without having to install XAMPP etc. 
 Its doing a good job but its sloooowwww, its taken two days to download 1.2Gb of a 2Gb site and its slowing down even more.
 Is there something like Cyotek Webcopy that will do a similar job for me but faster?

 I have a bunch of drives that I backup stuff via usb drive toaster, and I'm hoping to turn it into something more organized like I see on this subreddit. Total is about 32TB across about 20 drives. 
 Is there a safe way to migrate these drives into proxmox in a semi-automated fashion, or is the only real solution to build a new array with a enough space to import the drives one at a time over usb?
 Thanks,
 bob

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Please bear with me, this an involved posting. I have searched all over and have not come up with even a partial solution that would be self-hosted.
 I live in a WISP environment (Wireless Internet Service Provider), which I have no control over the WiFi APs. My access to the outside world is through WiFi using a router in a wifi bridge mode; no Ethernet connections are available. The architecture of the WISP system, WPA2-Enterprise, allows other apartments to connect to the AP in my apartment which has several SSIDs. Every apartment has an AP in it and act similarly.
 What I am looking for is a Monitoring/Analytics solution which gathers continuous passive WiFi environment information over time such as WiFi slowdowns, WiFi outages, number of WiFi clients attached to an AP MAC address, signal levels, number of WiFi disconnects/reconnects, etc. This is similar to what could be obtained by using Kismet with a filter to gather real time statistics. I would also like to not run out of disk space over a week if at all possible.
 Does any solution for this problem exist? Or, alternatively, could something like this be cobbled together from existing self-hosted parts? Thanks for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I get a little help with mergerfs? I'm struggling with the permissions. My current setup is two disks pooled as /mnt/storage. The storage directory has "nouser" and "nogroup", for owner and group. When I add directories to "storage" they are created with my local user and group. This is causing me a problem accessing them as a docker volume (I'm using the uid and gid of the local user). I can't even delete the directories created in "storage" as sudo. I can, however delete them from the "disk1" or "disk2". Can someone point in the right direction, please? Is there something special I need to do in the docker-compose file? Then end goal is to store media files and manage them with sonarr and radarr as containers, and docker permission denied error is a real road block.

 It's a while that I started the side project of building my home media and storage server, and I still have nothing working at hand, but I learned a lot and my opinion about what I want and what i need changed radically. Thus, I wanted to write down all my thoughts on my experience so far to gather opinions and suggestions.
 But first a bit of introduction. I am 25 years old, passionate about tech but not really expert about IT. Always used windows for school and gaming and recently became more conscious about owning my own data, it being by not using cloud storages, and paying for media I will not really own. On top of that, the recent world developments, geopolitically and in company strategies, made me more privacy conscious than before. PS: I have never used linux extensively …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Hoarders,
 ​
 i stand humble before you with the ask for help.
 ​
 I have two Hard drives (A, B) with Content that used to be identical but is as of now 70% the same. The rest is either only on A or on B.
 ​
 Both A and B have new added and removed data.
 I want to merge them to keep only one going forward.
 ​
 I tried to resolve the issue manually and with the help of https://freefilesync.org/
 but i get more mess than before
 ​
 i thought about my issue and think i could tackle it in a two step way:
 ​
  
​
  
first remove on Drive B every file that exists on Drive A at the same location and is identical
 wich leaves me with a delta of only Files Existing on Drive B that are either changed, added or removed from Drive A
 ​
 2)
 the second step would be to check which files that are left on Drive B do already exists on Drive A in any location and are identical (so i can catch files that were moved on Drive A to a new location) and delete them from Drive B
 Result:
 Which would leave me with just new and unique files on Drive B with a much smaller subset wich i could tackle manually and sort where need be
 ​
 does any of you have any Input or faced a similar problem? do you know of any tools that can do either step one or two. Much appreciated 
 I visualized what I want to achieve in this image:
