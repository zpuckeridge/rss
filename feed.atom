        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning, Afternoon, Evening wherever you are. 
 I have been doing Homelab-ish stuff for about 6-7 years (Started with a Poweredge 2950 and a Raspberry Pi) and honestly I've kinda hit a rut with what i should selfhost. 
 I've been looking through the awesome-selfhosted GitHub and some of the other ones and nothing really appeals to me like something I want to play with and work on. I've done most of the mainstream ones (Grafana, Plex (and the arr services), Wordpress, etc...) but I'm trying to find new ones to play with that I can actually have a use for. 
 The first thing that came to mind when I thought about it was Home Assistant cause I haven't really done anything with that yet, but I don't exactly have any devices that would connect up to HA (or if I do, I don't really use them or don't know about them). 
 Another thing I wanted to try doing was get a Grafana set up with Power Draw, but realized quick I would need special hardware that I don't really have the time nor money to get. 
 Please help me get out of this rut if you have any ideas. 
 Thanks

 so let just say that minipc is running a LOT of stuff, cpu wise it's ok ram usage, it's always at 75% minimum usage
 i'm starting to worry that I might need to get something a little bit "better" before I run out of ram or cpu, what do you think I should do?
 if changing it is the consensus, budget would be 200-300$ and must have 2 ethernet (i'm using a dedicated one for the unifi app to be under a specific vlan) and low power (under 20-25 watt)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a few months ago I finally got enough drives to fill up my server (Dell T630) and have a sizable amount of storage (3x 6 drive Z2's of 8TB SAS drives, 32TB RAW x 3). I'm currently using a Ubuntu 22.04.x VM with ZoL with the PERC H730 passed through.
 To get a single share I'm currently using mergerFS to combine my pools + gdrive. Biggest issue is that mergerFS as far as I've seen just prioritizes the first "drive", fills that up and them moves to the next drive without any kind of distribution. That means all my data currently is on that 1 pool and the other pools sit doing nothing. I've looked into Ceph and GlusterFS years ago but had too many issues with performance and setup. Now though, I really want to better utilize my storage and have something that would be easier to expand whenever I can add a second node or more storage as well as provide a bit of redundancy.
 The primary usage for my storage is just media for plex though I plan on setting up some space for backups as well with most/all of it backed up to gsuite for now. Is glusterfs a good option to get that single point of storage and share or are there better options now?
 Current setup

 I have checked the awesome-self-hosted list several times, and have been searching online for months and I haven't found anything that hits the mark. 
 Required:
  
Multi-User
 Collaboration, doesn't need to be realtime, but the ability to have notes that can be edited by multiple users.
 Tags or some other reasonable way to organize.
 full featured WYSIWYG editor. I love MD as a format, but I don't want to have to use it to make a shopping list. Plus none of the people I share notes with are "techsavvy" so I need something "anyone" could pickup and use. 
 Embed at-least Images & PDF files. 
 iOS apps, or at-least a mobile friendly WebUI. 
  
Preferred:
  
Highlight and markup PDFs and Images. (Synology can't do this)
 Drawing & Handwriting. (Synology can't do this)
 WebClipper extension for browsers. (preferably Firefox)
 Backlinks (Synology can't do this)
 Some way to create groups of notes from different notebooks (Smart Collections is what Synology calls this.)
  
I have searched high and low and can't find anything that checks all the boxes for me. I was actually surprised by this as most of this is stuff Evernote was doing over a decade ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m currently a Things 3 user for iOS/macOS. It does to-do management and some light project management. I love it, but I don’t like that I don’t have control of the sync service that the app uses. I’d like to find an app(s) that have iOS and desktop (or web) clients that can sync with a self-hosted service like Nextcloud/WebDAV/CalDAV/some other self hosted service.
 I’ve done some research but I can’t seem to find anything that fits my needs. I installed Nextcloud Tasks on my Nextcloud instance, but the web client doesn’t really work on mobile. I found an app called 2do. It looks like it would be a good fit, but the CalDAV sync with Nextcloud doesn’t really work. 
 Does anyone know of any apps/services that fit that description that provide a good UX? Thank you!

 I've been working on setting up a password management service that acts as a secure storage for passwords that allows user based access restriction and is accessible via web browser on computers that are shared by employees. Basically a page that people can login to an see whatever passwords they've been given access to.
 I've been trying out Passbolt using docker and have everything running correctly but I now realise that this is probably not the right thing for my needs as you can't actually switch between users on a shared computer. 
 Is there a similar password manager that allows this?

 --------------------------
 Finally today is the day. I always wanted to have my own NAS for homelab on a budget. So stared to source hardware few months ago.
 I managed to snag a used Dell Optiplex 9010 for C$25 and just today I got new 4x 4TB HDD for C$240 from marketplace.
 Below are the specs:
  
Dell Optiplex 9010
 Core i3-3220 @ 3.30GHz
 8GB DDR3 Ram
 500GB WD enterprise SATA HDD
 Samsung 128GB SATA SSD
  
Sealed pack 4x 4TB Seagate EXOS 7E8 SATA HDD. DOM: 23JUL2021
 In addition I have the below USB 3.0 Hard Drives:
  
5TB Seagate Expansion USB drive
 4TB Seagate Backup Plus Portable USB drive
 2TB Samsung M3 portable usb drive
 1TB Seagate Backup portable USB drive
 1TB WD my passport usb drive
  
From my current PC I have the following hard drives that I can include:
  
 HUA722020ALA330 Hitachi 2-TB 7.2K 3.5 3G 64MB SATA
 Samsung 1 TB Spinpoint 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 3.5 inch Bulk/OEM Desktop Hard Drive HD103SI
  
​
 What is the best strategy/setup you would recommend for this NAS build. How many storage pool? what RAID mode? etc.

 I'm embarrassed. I feel like I should know this, but as soon as numbers come into play, my eyes glaze over.
 Computer (Intel NUC5i5RYK) :
  
DC Input Voltage Supported: 12-19 VDC
 TDP: 15 W
  
UPS Backup Battery (APC UPS 600VA BE600M1)
  
Input Voltage: 120 Volts (120 VAC)
 600VA / 330W battery power
  
Does it sound like the UPS can support the computer and vice versa? I tried a UPS for this computer in the past and when I switched to battery mode, it didn't fully turn on and wouldn't for a couple weeks. I replaced the CMOS battery, and it worked again. I'm not sure if that's a BIOS setting or if it was truly not compatible, but I'm hoping it was just a coincidence.
 If that won't work, would something like this CyberPower EC850LCD work?
 I just want the Intel NUC to work on both battery and while plugged in.

 Returned it and bought a WD Red Plus 4TB. Received it today and I'm now hearing this clicking noise:

 ​
 Is this normal? This happens for every write operation.
 It's quite annoying and I can hear it clearly even when my case is only below my desk.

 I'm putting together a barebones R730 and bought an H330 Mini to add in. I failed to account for the cables though and saw the machine came with a pair of cables connecting the 2.5" 8-drive backplane to the motherboard's onboard SAS controller (Intel X99/PERC S130). The included cable assembly is part number 0K3H4M.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody!
 I'm new with Drone and I'm trying to figure out how it works.
 Their documentation seems to be a little poor or outdated.
 First I setup the secret called "secret_name" in the Secret Drone section in a repo called "test-repo". 
 Then I commit the "test-repo" with this .drone.yml file in it:
 --- kind: pipeline type: docker name: Drone YAML CI testing steps: - name: test_drone_docker image: alpine:3.9 commands: - echo "show hello world by drone" - echo $(pwd) - echo -e ${user} settings: user: from_secret: secret_name 
 And the result is the following:
 latest: Pulling from library/alpine Digest: sha256:bc41182b7ef5ffc53a40b044e762933bc10142b1243f395ee852a8c9730fc2ad Status: Image is up to date for alpine:latest + echo "show hello world by drone" show hello world by drone + echo $(pwd) /drone/src + echo -e 
 What am I doing wrong or miss?
  
EXTRA: 
 I've Drone integrated to my Gitea instance and sometimes after a change, Drone CI never starts. It's like don't see some commits.
 For example:
 git commit -m "Change readme.md"
 git push
 Task #1 runs ok
 git commit -m "Add a line to readme.md"
 git push
 Here the task #2 should run, but nothing happens. Any idea? (This is a random behavior. Maybe run maybe not. No matter the run number)
 It's Drone a little buggy or I just am I using it in a wrong way?
 Thanks!
  
Drone image docker version: drone/drone:2
 Drone runner version: drone-runner-docker:1
 Gitea version: gitea/gitea:1.17.3 I've drone installed with Gitea

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: Look for the 'procedure' section.
 I wanted to share some videos with a few friends. I find youtube's scanning of my videos (AI subtitle generation, voice recognition/model training, etc) all just plain creepy. I didn't want anything as complicated as Plex or Jellyfish (Jellyfin? Jelly somthin). My initial plan was to just use the HTML <video> tag, but that ends up downloading the entire file before playback, which doesn't really work when the videos I want to share are 30+GB. (It's gopro footage I take, chill)
 For later - input_files
 file 'S:\goprotmp\GX020003.MP4' file 'S:\goprotmp\GX020003.MP4' file 'S:\goprotmp\GX030003.MP4' 
 Procedure
  
I assume you already have a webserver and understand how to get a basic HTML file on it.
 I assume you have ffmpeg already installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come to the realization that I have way too much stuff to keep track of in my head. I have a few dozen hard drives, a handful of servers, big things like TVs and laptops that I should write down for insurance, and about a thousand DVDs/BluRay/VHS stuff that I'd like to keep tabs on.
 I was mostly curious of pitfalls others have run into, general make sure you do X type stuff, etc or guides that have pointers.
 If you're interested in giving more specific advice, My system would be like this:
 *Snipe IT for tracking everything. I have most everything in excel sheets and I don't need tons of metadata. Mostly locations, serial numbers for big things, or conversion methods for little things. *Everything gets a tag, specifically an Avery 6460 sticker with a barcode. Servers, DVDs, tapes, etc. I'd get non-permanent labels so they could be removed. *Storage boxes also get a tag. I originally for media had it alphabetized, but now that things are spanning multiple boxes it gets harder to add things in and shuffle things when a box gets full. I figure a tag can tie to a location in Snipe.
 I don't think using a UPC as an identifier is feasible, as I'm learning a lot of my media library doesn't have any and there's no good way of looking up a UPC (all the sites I've poked around on either cost a lot or simply don't work). I also feel like labels are overkill.
 Thanks for any guidance, I don't work with physical assets at work so this is a very foreign endeavor.

 However, the media tab didn't show anything, and when I tried to look up .mp4 I just get kept getting "fetch" stuff that would appear blank: https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/53613266_356782574924247_4045776294154163764_n.mp4?_nc_ht=scontent-ord5-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_cat=103&_nc_ohc=NAqFbUI5vvUAX9LWniM&edm=ALQROFkBAAAA&ccb=7-5&oh=00_AfCuNfuect8TPjYKb-59InaIVdDGL_QymtMdr_i3YJc1iQ&oe=63603ACB&_nc_sid=30a2ef&bytestart=182736&byteend=265046

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just got my hands on ICX6450-24P switch. I know these are very popular among home-labbers so figured I'd check in with you crazies. I'd like to get the stock fans modified. There seems to be a lot of info scattered around about these switches but I'm really looking for a definitive guide on fan mods.
 I'm seeing various approaches for replacing the 40MM stock fans - Sunon, Noctua, and a few other brands. 
 It will be in a rack and it does not need to be silent but does need to be quiet due to how adjacent to a living space the rack is.
 Questions:
  
What are the best choices for which fan to swap in? I was looking at this (https://www.coolerguys.com/products/sunon-40x20mm-replacement-fan-for-cisco-routers-switches-891-1811-1803-2811-7301-2950) which already seems to be pre-wired for the unique wiring pattern of the Brocade. it says Cisco but I have seen some people mention it works on Brocade. I was also looking at Noctua (https://www.amazon.com/Noctua-NF-A4x20-FLX-Premium-40x20mm/dp/B072JK9GX6/) which seems to be a good bit quieter than the Sunon. Which other ones are out there?
 How big of a POE load do I need to have before I should worry about temps? I won't be using anywhere near the rated capacity. I'll probably end up somewhere around 50-75W. 
 Is there any fan out there that will not show the "Fan Failed" message in the console? My main concern is I just want to be able to monitor if the fans actually do fail.
  
Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I like to name my photos and videos in the yyyy-mm-dd_hh-mm-ss format so that when I sort them by name, all the photos and videos of a particular event show in the order they were shot in, not to mention that memories shot by different people of the same event shows in an integrated manner.
 I have used XNView for years on Windows. I was fine with its slightly complex layout because the speed of performance and image renaming features were excellent. What I did miss on it was proper renaming options for videos. So, playing videos chronologically after a photo in the same event/folder wasn't a smooth experience. Making slideshows work wasn't great either.
 Years back, I would enjoy the face recognition features of Google Picasa, and also it's smooth and polished interface. But performance and development was lacking, which is what caused me to adopt XNView.
 Then, when I got an iPhone, using MS Photos became necessary to import the photos from the phone into the PC. Soon, my workflow began to include Advanced Renamer for renaming videos using their 'encode date' from the iPhone instead of just the 'modificed date' like with my XNView workflow (since videos don't have a 'date taken' in their EXIF).
 Gradually, I began to look at my digital memories more on MS Photos than XNView. It automatically scans for location tags, visual subjects like 'beach' and 'trees'. The face recognition on MS Photos is really cool—the ability to show my parents all their photos from all the years—it just adds to the fun of browsing through many memories, which become difficult without face recognition. A slideshow on MS Photos is more immersive as it smoothly plays the videos also.
 I know that Photos gets a lot of hate, and rightly so. It's a performance hog. And one feature I miss on it is the ability to sort in reverse—oldest to newest.
 Hence, do you guys have suggestion for a free software that will match up to MS Photos while giving the power of XNView?

To be clear there is no psu/mobo in this case. 
 I'm having a hell of a time searching for one, if such at thing exists. If I can't find anything I'll just drill holes into the side of the case and use zip ties / velcro to make my own.
 I figured others who build NAS might have run into this solution / problem before.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a single host (10.1.10.10) running 20+ docker containers. One of the containers running on the host is pihole that's configured to run on both a custom docker bridge network (192.168.10.0/24) and a macvlan network (10.1.10.0/24). 
 Additional containers running on the host are two instances of NPM --- one configured for external WAN access via cloudflared and the other for internal LAN access. The "internal" NPM is on the same two networks that pihole runs on (all containers have static IP). 
 Pihole is configured as split DNS; I have a single DNS Record entry pointing mydomain.com to the MACVLAN IP address of the internal NPM (10.1.10.7). I have several CNAME Records pointing service.mydomain.com to mydomain.com. Internal NPM directs service.mydomain.com to [container_hostname]:PORT and restricts access to local IPs only. From a device on the LAN with IP 10.0.0.0/8, everything works beautiful. 
 My issue --- I'm trying to understand how to route internal docker traffic through split DNS. For example, if I need portainer container, which is only on the bridge network, to access auth.mydomain.com, portainer cannot resolve it because it's unable to ping 10.1.10.7 (internal NPM); it can, however, ping internal NPM by the hostname or the bridge 192.168.10.X IP address. 
 Has anyone run across this problem before? I'd rather not put 20+ containers all on the MACVLAN network so they can communicate to NPM. I thought about volume mounting /etc/hosts on every container to point service.mydomain.com to the internal 192.168.10.X reverse proxy IP, but thought there might be a more elegant way to do it with docker network changes. Any ideas? 
 Thanks for the help.

 So I'm currently planning to build (or buy) my first PC, which will be used as a server.
 I will use this server for many purposes, including : - Hosting small game servers (Minecraft) - Mysql DB - VPN & other stuff While everything will be running on Docker.
 So I've digged a bit in the subject and I like the compact size of the Mini-ITX, but I'm afraid some parts won't be upgradeable and I don't know if the cooling will be efficient enough, especially when running game servers. As for the CPU, I've seen the Ryzen 5700u, but I got no idea if it works the same way as a desktop cpu. As for the Mini-ITX, this form factor tends to be bigger in size ( but very flexible to transport). I also don't know a lot of headless cases.
 So I would like to have your advice and some build/pc recommendations. :)

 What is a cost effective method I could use for these backups? I don't mind getting a slower spinny HDD over an SDD (as I won't edit off of these).
 I'm not looking for some massive RAID setup or a backup server. Only an external drive (and possibly a second one for redundancy). I do know how to work with computer hardware and whatnot, so putting an internal drive in some sort of housing, if that's cheaper, is no problem for me.

 version: "2.1" services: qbittorrent: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest container_name: qbittorrent environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Toronto - WEBUI_PORT=6969 volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/qbittorrent_data/config:/config - /media/user/Data/Media/Downloads:/downloads ports: - 6969:6969 - 6881:6881 - 6881:6881/udp restart: unless-stopped 
 What I don't understand is why qBittorrent is able to create the incomplete download file in "/Downloads/Incomplete" but it's still giving the "Errored" message. If it has read/write access then shouldn't it be working?
 How do I fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a raspberry pi 4 with multiple services running on raspberry pi os (64 bits).
 The idea is to have an attached USB drive accesible for some friends and I in which we can share some folders and have another private ones for each other. Something like a Google Drive type of service. It isn't necessary to mount the drive on windows although it would be nice too. A simple web UI accessible from my internet domain is all I need.
 I've read about Open media vault but never used it, it seems that it focuses on files only on the same network, It would be nice to know if it fits the purpose.
 Any suggestion is appreciated.

 The problem is the downloads folder's path keeps changing because a Docker container keeps creating a new folder with the same name, using up that path.

 I am currently in the process of planing my new Nas that should solve my storage problems for the next couple years and give me plenty expansion option.
 My goal is to have 36 sas hdds connected to my server without a bottleneck with the least amount of pcle 4.0 x16 slots. The max amount i found where some lsi cards with 24 ports and they where quite expensive.
 I also read about expanders but how negative is the effect on the performance?
 From what i understand you could for example split a single 6g connection to two 3g ones, which should still be fine for hdds, right?
 Would it work to get one of the 24 ports with an expander and then use (theoretically) 48 disks at 3g each, without a performance hit when all disks are written to at the same time?
 Thx :)

Github shows a lot of activity, would love to see it grow. It has some great videos on youtube showing you how to use it. However they're about 4 years old, they don't always match the interface but the majority of them are accurate enough to show you how to build an internal app. I'm not affiliated with the project. 
 Install is easy enough, extract to a folder nginx or apache can server, edit the sample config to match your environment and open it in a browser. Fairly simple. 
 If there's another project similar to this I'd love to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had an interest in revisiting some old iOS apps I used to play as a kid so I've been looking into where I can download some of the delisted ones. I've noticed though that archive.org seems to be having trouble keeping IPA files available for download, or at least I assume so.
 For example, one of my favorite iOS games, Gesundheit! by Matt Hammill, has been delisted for a few years now. I found two reuploads of the game on archive.org but both are missing the IPA file itself (1, 2). There was also an upload that contained Gesundheit! and 20 to 30 other iOS 3.2 apps, but that is completely gone now (dead link). I also noticed an upload from the same user for iOS 3.0 apps, but that too is gone now (dead link).
 Thankfully I still have an IPA of Gesundheit! from before these archives were removed, but I don't know if I should reupload it to archive.org Is this a common issue with hosting IPA files on archive.org, or is this an isolated case? If this is common, is there anywhere safer I can have my IPA files preserved? I'd greatly appreciate any insight. Thank you all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New to homelabbing so not even sure if my idea would work. I want to build a new workstation and a server. However, I can't really afford to do both of those, the computer I have priced out is around 2k and about 500-1k for the server. How possible would it be to combine the two and run a VM as my workstation? I plan to do a bit of gaming and remote work as a IT tech when I work from home. Gameplanning this, I want two GPU's one for passthrough for gaming and one for anything else I need on my server, like hardware decoding. I tried looking online for this and maybe my search terms were bad, but I really couldn't find anything. Thoughts?

 So I searching for self hosted mailserver solution. I know many people say "don't do it" but I convinced to do it anyway. (So plz don't comment "use hosting" etc ;) ) 
 So I've seen many options on internet (like mailu, mailcow, docker-mailserver or mail-in-a-box) but don't any recent reviews/comparisons. So I come to ask you guys ;)
 My requirements/plan:
 - I plan to limit ramusage of mailserver to ~2GB RAM max
 - Work with Nginx Proxy Manager with no bigger issues (I know I need to bind certs to mailserver container too)
 - I will use webmail, if not included, probably roundcube or nextcloud-client
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 i'd like to setup a UPS to ensure my homelab can safely shut down during a power outage. I have purchased a Powerwalker VI 600 STL. It has an USB-HID connector on the back which is currently connected to my Synology DS216. I set up the UPS via DSM and it seems to be working fine. But now i'd like to connect also my Proxox server. As it seems i have the following options
 Software: * Synology integrated * Bluewalker powermaster * nut * acpud
 I already tried running the powermaster on my synology. But due to some misconfiguration it kept shutting down the nas - and i hadn't enough time to reconfigure it. Running powermaster on the proxmox server host seemed to be ok. But, somehow i wasn't able to connect my Synology to it via SNMP. I tried it with SNMPv1 and SNMPv3 (authentication and no authentication). In both cases the Synology claimed that it wasn't able to connect to the proxmox server. I also opened TCP-Port 161 on the proxmox frontend.
 I'd like to use powermaster, as it has a lot of features including notification via E-Mail and HTTP-post. The latter would be important for me to make custom notification forwarding to my matrix server etc. Although, powermaster had a ton of features i cloudn't get it working with both of my "server".
 What do you think? Where should I connect my UPS (proxmox host or Synology)? Which software should i use?

 Even something as simple as a little "Patron" badge on their comment or whatever, its not necessary but would be absolutely wonderful.
 Anyone know if such a thing exists?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have an extensive movie / tv, documentary collection. I was previously running it on a Windows 7 machine using Windows Media Center with the Media Browser plug in. I collected my own metadata through Media Center Master and used that program to update ongoing shows using it's automatic downloader function.
 I am in the process of moving this system to a Windows 10 (probably should update to 11?) and obviously there is no more Windows Media Center.
 I am looking for an easy solution to transfer my library, I know a lot has changed since I built this in 2011 so I am looking for some ideas and recommendations to accomplish the following:
  
Media Center service that can read my own meta data the way I have it built, no renaming files or any of that. I have played around with Plex a number of years ago but i think it was using it's own metadata source and found it worked decently but made enough mistakes in identifying titles where it was annoying. I could have been using it wrong though. I also dabbled in Kodi back in the day but found it never displayed things as good as Media Browser in Windows Media Center, so I was largely unimpressed.
 An Automatic Downloading program to keep shows up to date, even identify new movie releases to select from, and provide ownership of the metadata much like Media Center Master did. MCM just feels dated now and i am sure there may be better solutions out there.
 If possible, a recordings service to record streaming videos.
 Preferably free however I am open to reasonably priced one-time payments like it did for MCM (man I got a lot of mileage out of that program!)
  
It does not have to be all in one service. Just looking for ideas. Jellyfin looks interesting but wondering what others would recommend.
 Thanks!

 I am trying to "publicly" present my *arr calendars (honestly, just Sonarr will be fine). They use iCal / Webcal links
 I have tried Nextcloud both as a VM and as a docker, I've tried ICS View docker and a few others, but can't seem to get it working. Nextcloud just timed out, ICS View wouldn't start / load.
 Organizr worked perfectly via pc browser, however the calendar didn't work on mobile browsers (it only partially displayed)? 
 I have the ability to spin up dedicated VMs of any flavour or use Docker. My skillset is kind of limited, but I am trying to learn more.
 Any suggestions or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

 I am slowly getting started just trying things out and not committed to any particular applications. I know there are porn specific tools. I am asking more how to plan things out and maybe there are some techical aspects I need to learn up on.
 How do you manage access to keep it discreet? What if I wanted to use the same service for both kinds of content? Is it possible to run 2 instances of a server on a single machine and have them not get mixed up? Seperate domains?
 Same question about media gathering tools like torrents, ytdlp, wget etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm usually not one to ask questions, but I'm at a loss for this. I figured if there was anywhere that could help me with large storage servers, it'd be r/datahoarders
 I recently had a bad electrical experience which knocked out my storage server. ( I know, I should keep off site backups, or cloud based, but I'm running 34tb+ of data, and the cost for cloud is more expensive than just getting it recovered by a company.)Due to this I sent off my drives to get the data recovered, which I got back with no trouble, but now I'm having difficulties getting them brought back into my new NAS. 
 My plan was to move the drives over to the new NAS one a time, then I can use the drives that the data was on to expand the new NAS array. (none of the drives in question were from the original failure) I am at a complete loss at what kind of formatting and partitioning these drives were set up with. The trouble being the new NAS is not able to read the drives at all, and the only way I've managed to get them to show up properly is on a Windows machine, it almost seems like it was set up in a RAID from the company, but even that doesn't make sense from the odd formatting.
 First off it's 4 drives, 10TB SAS.Each of the drives are somehow showing up as basic MBR, even though they're 9+TB partitions, different tools give me different information as to how the drives are partitioned.
  
Macroit says they're each just one large logical partition
 AOMEI is showing that they each have 6 partitions
 Windows doesn't even show the disks as formatted except for the first one, the rest give me an error when I attempt to click on it.
  
When I was using Ubuntu the disks would show up the same way as Windows does.
 I just need to figure out how they're formatted so I know if it's safe to format one of the drives at a time.
 I apologize if I didn't provide enough information, please let me know if there's anything else you think could help.

 I can't run cable where I moved to cause it's a rental.
 If you had a rack of servers and couldn't run cable, what wireless option would you choose and how would you set it up? Need to set up certain devices in a separate VLAN also. 
 I suck at networking and I'm just looking for suggestions so I have a starting point. Most budget friendly options are preferred but if something a little more expensive is worth the cost I'm open minded.

 I am in the process of helping my friend set up his very first home server - A Dell R510 12 bay. It doesn't have a RAID controller, and from what I've seen, the H200 (flashed to IT mode) seems like a good choice for doing software raid. My friend will be running either Proxmox or unRAID. 
 I have a couple questions before purchasing this card
  
 What is the max number of drives supported by 1 H200 card? I’ve read that it’s 256 drives but I’d like to double confirm with y’all.
 
 Is there any limitation max drive capacity per HDD? I don’t think so but again, looking for this community’s help.
  General question - how is the H200 different from something like an LSI 9211-8i since that card breaks out one SFF-8087 into only 4 SATA drives? here's an example

The truenas scale is running on 16gb USB stick connected on USB 2.0, in sata port is an Crucial 2tb ssd, one usb 3.0 wd 1tb ssd(7$ caddy) and other USB 1 tb seagate hdd(same caddy). Everything is configured on stripe. Is running like this since 2,5 months ago 24/7 downloading every day between 5 and 100 gb. At this point I'm happy to say that truenas doesn't report any error. No drive was damaged or disconnected (all was old and used) and no corruption on data. If all was good I jumped to the next step. Pool was deleted today and the configuration is now with more mixed ssd and hdd over usb's hub. I will leave it to run like this on stripe for a few months. On OS are installed just 3 apps:plex server, netdata and qb.... 
 Let's see what's happens and when will fail something. 
 Again the purpose of this is how long will take until something will crash and if you can build an server from trash :) 
 Just home lab for fun

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The new solution.
 Upgrading my Ubuntu server to TrueNAS Scale, I wanted to simplify the boot drive situation. I am using a Rosewill 4U case with 12 hot swap bays so there is no good place to put an extra 2.5" boot drive, as well I would have to run a SATA power cable from my modular PSU. I also don't like the idea of wasting so much space on a 120GB SSD for 8-9GB of OS storage, despite the drives being cheap.
 So, using two of these cheap dual adapter cards in the picture (that I got for ~$4 each when I bought 10 on Aliexpress) I was able to mount 16GB m.2 SATA SSDs as a mirror for my boot pool. I already had the SSDs from a lot I bought on eBay for ~$2 each and was using to build IDE SSDs for vintage laptops and computers. The cards provide power to the SSD from the PCIe slot so I just had to run the data cable from the card to the motherboard.
 Then since I planned on running VMs from my system as well, I added two cheap NVMe drives as I was using the slots anyway and set them up as a mirrored pool. I find the whole setup a lot cleaner than the 120GB SSD I had sitting in there when I was running Ubuntu. Would be better if the card didn't require the SATA cable but I didn't want to shell out the extra money for a card with the SATA controller built in.
 Been using it for about a week and so far pretty happy with it, currently building an identical offsite system to use the same setup, and bought some more cards and SSDs for future servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large "collection" of adult material, accumulated over the years, mostly just photos. I used to use really generic folders to organize it but eventually got lazy. Then I discovered Mylio, which has some pretty awesome facial recognition.
 It will recognize a face from a photo, you tell it who that face belongs to, then for all of the examples it has of that person, it'll try to recommend more photos who it thinks are the same person. It gets more and more confident the more examples it has, and you can customize the level of confidence required for it to "guess" about a person's identity if the matches you're getting aren't good enough or something.
 It works great, for photos at least, and it runs locally on my PC and is accessible via the mobile app if I'm on the same network. However, it's not free past a certain point, and the tagging tools and certain other parts of the desktop and mobile apps leave a lot to be desired.
 Does anyone know of a similar application/system/script I can run in order to do the same thing?

I have been Googling and reading some reviews for the past couple of hours, and I came down to a list of 4 options to choose from. I will use the external hard drive on Windows and Mac, and I will be backing up big files, most of the files are 100GB+
 ​
 I need your help to choose one of these, or if you can recommend another reliable one.

 It's technically the same as the one I have, but with higher storage. I am okay with my current hard drive, but I feel it's not so fast. When I am copying or pasting a file to/from an HDD, it takes too long.

 I've got some software running in an Ubuntu VM server. It seems to work fine, as I can access it's webUI via HTTP on the local network without issue.
 However, when I try to set up an nginx reverse-proxy subdomain configuration for this, it prompts me with an error about "contradictory scheme headers" ( only when accessed via subdomain.mydomain.com ), and I can't seem to find much more information in either of the NGINX logs or the VM NGINX logs.
 My assumption is that Cloudflare's enforcement of HTTPS and that this VM server is running on HTTP is causing this error.
 The VM server has an NGINX configuration of its own, which is it was when installed. This software suite seems particularly fragile so I haven't been to eager to mess with these settings:

 To that end, I'll be powering a tower of hard drives via its own dedicated ATX power supply. To connect them via USB, I've discovered a possible combination of products that might work, or might not, and I'm wondering if anyone has tried this before.
 First I would connect all the SATA drives to this SATA-to-M2 board:

 I have a new box ready to go: Dell Optiplex i5 8GB RAM and a blank 256GB SSD. I plan to use Ubuntu as the Host OS.
 I want to run:
  
Wireguard
 Nextcloud
 Matrix
 Jitsi
 PHP app + MySQL (hypothetical)
  
I previously set up a box with Proxmox, which was cool and all, but I don't want separate VMs. It's a pain to have X separate IPs for X hosts and manage/maintain all X VM OSes. I need a low-key humble homelab! Besides, I want to run something that is more commonly used in SMB/EDU prod.
 How would you decide whether to run these apps on the host OS, in a VM, an LXC, or a Docker container? What factors do you consider?
 NOTE: I want to learn popular tools and methods that could help me advance my SysAdmin career. In our small, private, low-budget K12 env, we use Hyper-V, so I know the basics of that. But I want to self-host more FOSS to save us money and not feed the beasts (M$, Oracle, Cisco, etc.).
 P.S. I did my DD and read all the Reddit posts that I could find on the topic. Here, I'm looking for some specific factors to use for current and future analysis.

 I'm trying to figure out why this is happening, so any insight and help would be immensely appreciated! 
 I'm running into a severe performance issue with backing up two local mountpoints (disks) on OpenMediaVault using Urbackup. 
 The setup is an i5 3470, 12GB of RAM, 256GB SSD and the two mount points are SMR 500GB 5400rpm disks. 
 This is a test scenario, as I want to see what I can get away with. The primary disk I'm attempting a backup of consists of various random files dumped onto an SMB share, which then gets backed up to another HDD (not shared by SMB). I know that these drives can sustain a 90MB/s throughput by doing a simple copy & transfer. 
 However, as pictured below, when trying to backup HDD #1 to HDD #2, we're averaging around 50-100mbit/s with an expected E…]]></summary>

 I also still have to mount the cd or the iso on the system for most to play properly. 
 I’ve seen some of the games I struggle with work flawlessly on the internet archive in the web browser and I would like to use something like emulatorjs to accomplish this. 
 If people have resources they know of I’d appreciate some solid reference material. Evening I’ve found that is kind of related is pretty old. 
 I did at one point have a dosbox environment setup with lots of these games installed inside, but that would be difficult for kids to navigate so replicating the ease of IA web browser play would be ideal.

 With my self hosted environments I am often booting in to gparted or clonezilla to repartition or back up.
 I also use these tools on friends and familys machines before working on them.
 Grml-rescue boot automates adding iso files to your boot partition and updating grub.
 In my case it was apt-get install grml-rescueboot, copying iso files to /boot/grml and running update-grub each time I add an iso.
 So awesome. Much better than a usb key in many instances. Especially if you can get them to boot in to ram which this seems to support with
 echo 'CUSTOM_BOOTOPTIONS="toram"' >> /etc/default/grml-rescueboot Then running Update-grub

 Hi,
 so I'll be taking my first steps in the selfhosting journey with an ODROID HC4 DIY NAS running open media vault. What I'd like to know whether there is a tool that I can install on the device that would let me download files from an sftp server through a web-interface. I'd like to skip a step in having the file transfer directly from the server to the NAS instead of booting up the PC to manage the transfer process with filezilla. Basically something like filezilla but running on the NAS that has a webinterface to start transfers. Any ideas are welcome.
 Thanks!

I can’t find any information specific to WD80EFZZ-P on WD’s web site or elsewhere, but they seem to be about $20 more expensive than the WD80EFZZ drives - I’d like to know why.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, this is probably a very obvious question, but I've been Googling for a while now and want to make absolutely sure
 I recently started messing around with an older laptop as a home server, running Fedora Server. Got some services like Jellyfin, Pi-hole, Heimdall and Nextcloud running in Docker containers via Portainer. In the future I might set up remote access via Wireguard. I want to make sure everything is only accessible via my local network for now, though, as I don't feel comfortable exposing my server to the internet yet
 I have port forwarding and UPnP disabled on my router, and always make sure that my OS and apps are up to date. I believe this is enough to ensure that my server and the running services can only be reached via LAN. Is this enough, or should I take extra precautions? I do have things like SSH and compass allowed in firewalld, as well as the required ports for my Pi-hole, Jellyfin instance, etc. Is that okay?

 What is the best way to set up an automated process to reverse image search these images online, then save alt text / titles / urls / etc that the process might find?
 Only potential lead I have would be to pin to pinterest and then have a supposed pinterest feature that goes out and scrapes Google for metadata, then download and consolidate.

 Figured I'd post my RMA experience here since I'm sure there are a lot of Samsung SSD owners here, may save you some time if you need to RMA one of their drives.
 One day my OS crashed while trying to acess a file and upon rebooting, the boot drive (870 EVO 1TB) was reporting SMART read errors, and it seemingly couldn't reallocate the sectors properly. Googling around, it seems like this is some kind of recurring quality issue with these drives that Samsung refuses to acknowledge. My drive was only a year old with ~35TB written so well within the warranty. Kind of unfortunate since Samsung always seems to be heralded as the king of reliability in the SSD market.
 As for the RMA process, the first thing I would suggest is r…]]></summary>

 I want to move the second set of backups drives offsite, but I've realized I don't really have anywhere to take them. At first, I thought I'd just pay for a bank box and store them there, but then I realized most bank locations don't offer personal safety boxes anymore. Now, I realize I don't have any secure place outside my home to store offsite backups. How are all of you handling this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I’m looking for some advice. I was wondering if, instead of removing the pin on the drive itself, I could attach my drive (in this case a WD100EMAZ) to a female sata to male sata extension and remove the pin on that. I know there’s guides everywhere on how to do this, but I worry about ruining the surrounding pins and subsequently the drive and my data when trying to remove the pin, molex to sata is bad for your data, and the kapton tape solution just makes me nervous about getting pieces of tape stuck where they shouldn’t be. Could this solution work, or is there a less invasive way to make this work? Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have tested all the note taking apps in that awesome-self-hosted GitHub page, plus 10+ Google search results, etc. Maybe my requirements are too unique? I am about to give up and maybe create my own, but before doing that I want to ask here. My requirements are:
  
Free for personal use
 Data is hosted on a server, and NOT an app using local data file like Obsidian.
 Desktop/mobile web UI, NOT needing a special client app like Turtl, Joplin, Obsidian, etc.
 Ability to paste or attach images
 Dark mode
 Full text search, not just title/tag search
  
I tried to use Trilium, but the UI is too complex and slow. Isn't there something simple and fast? Other than occasional images, the total size of textual notes would not grow more than a few MB's (1~3KB per note * 1000 notes), so it really doesn't need to be complex requiring a heavy-duty database like Postgres, like some of the note-taking apps I have tried..

The seller claimed the 40Gb IDE hard drive had been fully formatted. When in actual fact it still contained the Windows XP OS from 2012 used by a city council office complete with wedding photos and home maintenance invoices containing the home address of the council worker who used the computer.
 Just shows what little concern most people have about their private data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I currently run a business on my gaming PC, but currently, the motherboard and its components are just sitting out on some cardboard. The case was delayed and I just wanted to use the PC, so I went without but now it seems way too cumbersome to strip the motherboard and install it in the case. But I feel that one day, I will sneeze or something and I'll break it. I currently turn it on by using a screwdriver to short the two prongs.
 Anyway, the way things work is that the PC runs a few data-heavy python scripts, then sends the data to another database which then is displayed on my site. 
 I want to have the python code and the necessary files on a remote VM that is hosted by another company. I want to be able to access it from anywhere if I have to debug on-the-fly or if my PC eventually breaks. 
 I would like to use a vmware horizon solution, but I've been navigating the site for over 30 mins now and can't just find a straight-up price / download. This effort to obscure the price makes me think that whatever the price is, it's too high. 
 So, what is a low-cost and easy-to-setup windows VM that I can access remotely? It has to be hosted on a network that isn't my own.
 Thank you

 I've got a Dell PowerEdge R520 and something from SuperMicro, and the fans are so loud that I end up turning off my machines after a few days to get some quiet.
 I've tried unplugging the fans, but I get worried about heat dissipation. Don't want to cook my machines.
 Does anyone have any tips for me?

 I have a tons of videos i want to convert from h264 (i think they'r mostly h264) to h265.
 I have few questions if possible:
 1- Is it true that the 264->265 conversion has no quality loss?
 2- How long it usually takes to convert a video? Lets say 90 minutes of a 720 H264 to H265 with 32gb ram and I5-6400 cpu?
 3- Anyone know a good free software to do it that is not too complicated? 
 Thanks a lot!

 I’ve updated my router to point to my local DNS server address and rebooted the router. The router appears to have successfully updated the address but when I go to Network -> Advanced -> DNS on my Mac, it still points to Comcast’s DNS server. I would expect the DNS address update to automatically propagate to my device’s network configuration. I’ve tried rebooting and re-adding the Wi-Fi network. Any one know why this could be the case or a possible resolution?

I have all the time in the world but I think my willpower to push further is waning. YouTube videos are great until it doesn't %100 apply to the situation. I rtfm, I've set up a boat load of dockers which work great. What is left to do is all the security (https, TLS/SSL), a public HTTP server, public ftp server, wireguard, nginx, Plex, docker network, proper cache settings.
 I'm totally capable of doing all that but it's just turning into such a time sink that I want to do other things instead. I'm not interested in spending weeks understanding how to get a SSL certificate for my domain installed, even though that's how it goes. Has anyone here had experience with hiring someone to do all that work under contract? Such a crazy proposition considering they'd have complete and total access to all personal data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm getting married next year, and we're starting to try to figure out how we're going to handle things like RSVPs and gift registries. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations, preferably for self-hosted tools?
 Specifically what I am looking for so far (doesn't have to be in one app):
  
Good RSVP system - like Zola or WithJoy. We want to restrict rsvps to people who we invite, so ideally I want to be able to have a personalized link for each guest that we'll add to their invite along with a qr code. Something where they go to their link and it already has their information filled out and only need to answer a couple questions.
 Gift registry - I'm leaning towards just linking to something like Zola's gift registry or individual gift registries at different stores, but it would be nice to have one place where they are synchronized.
 Gift tracker? Not sure what to call it, but something to keep track of who gave us what so that we can send out thank-yous
 Simple website to display travel instructions, FAQs, etc
 Photo Uploader - An app or website where guests can upload photos to a shared folder that we can access. I might set up another instance of nextcloud with anonymous uploads just for this, unless there is something better?
 Photo Gallery - For after the wedding if we want to share photos.
 
Contacts updater - For people who we don't have contact info for, we'd send them a link to some sort of form for them to provide their mailing address. Worst case we can probably use google forms for this.
  
I have a few ideas for some of these things, but would appreciate any ideas everyone has! We've also been looking at something like squarespace or self-hosting wordpress/ghost. All of the generic "wedding website builder" offerings don't offer much customizability, but we also definitely want to at least use some sort of template and not do everything from scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a noob when it comes to ZFS.
 I went overboard with my homelab setup with 2x 16 drive storage arrays and a 12 bay server and setup a RaidZ3 pool with 3 vdevs, 1 for each piece of hardware (2x16drives,1x12drives), all 3TB SAS drives.
 I'm realizing I don't need this much storage at this very moment but already copied over my existing data and downloaded some new stuff too. 
 Is there any option for me to shrink the pool? Or do I have to transfer the data off and create a new pool?
 I'm also assuming if I start with a 12 drive pool raidz3 (which will be enough for the moment), I can add more vdevs to the raidz3 pool later when I fill it and need more space? Am I correct on that? 
 Just want to save on my electric bill for now rather than pay for unused space. 
 Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, long timer lurker first time poster.
 I'm looking for a self hosted alternative to Cloudflare's Zero Trust / Access.
 For those who aren't super familiar with it, CF Zero Access is nice because the user has to authenticate through CF to the SSO before they're even able to get to the proxied web application. This is nifty because it protects crappy PHP web applications against unauthenticated attacks since no traffic is allowed to the application until the user is authenticated.
 I've done my research but most of the solutions I've found (Authelia, Authentik, etc) only seem to support proxying underlying web application when using HTTP Basic authentication. As soon as you're talking about using OAuth2 or something else modern the flow always seems to revert to going to the web application and then clicking the login button. This opens them up to unauthenticated attacks again.
 Am I missing something obvious or does anyone have any ideas?
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm trying to preserve some videos of a youtube channel and the app I'm using lets me either download them in a .webm format as is or convert to mp4 H.264 which is the same size but there's very noticeable artifacts and lower quality of the video.
 I did test another converter which lets me do mp4 H.264 and this one is the same quality as the webm but it's a 6 times larger file.
 My question is if the webm format will be a problem in the future (compatibility wise)? I would rather keep it standard to mp4 but I don't like the larger file sizes. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a jam-band lover on my holiday gift-giving list, and I'm thinking of doing a substantial download (~4TB) from bt.etree.org over the next couple months, and giving it to him on some easy-to-use device. The simplest would just be HDD, but I don't think he actually has any type of local media server (like not even iTunes on a PC). So, my question is:
 Is there something like a vendor NAS OS that would:
  
Provide an SMB service so he can connect the music to Sonos
 Possibly host Jellyfin/Plex/ other audio-specific media server
 Give him access to a BT client so he can continue to grow his library
 Keep itself reasonable up-to-date and secure
  
I'm familiar with a DIY solution, but this needs to be more of an appliance than a hobby unto itself. Part of the gift would be opening the door to the contemporary bittorrent version of the 'taper/trader' jam band scene.
 Any tips would be awesome, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a POE switch for my homelab. Of course, it must be 19" to fit into my rack and since it's homelab price is a very important component; I'd hope to get something around 200$. I a couple of years I may upgrade to 10GBe anyway.
 It needs to be managed; at the very least VLANs must be supported and 802.1X.
 I also want to feed some access points and cameras via PoE so it must also be PoE.
 In terms of ports 16 might do it but 24 would be a good number.
  
Mikrotik does not seem to have proper PoE out switches (except the one for 1000 bucks)
 TP Link TL-SG2424P is slightly more (~300$) than I was hoping for
 GS1900-24HPV2 for is also ~300$
  
Is there anything else I should consider?

 However, both were manufactured the same day in 2021. The "used" disk had 120h of prior usage according to SMART. Should I return one and try to buy another one at a different online store, or is this no longer a risk?
 I have searched a lot and there seems to be some correlation, but usually USENIX and other papers I've read on the matter usually talk about huge disk arrays... how about a simple 2-bay RAID-1 setup? Should I take the extra precaution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Lenovo ThinkCentre M93p tiny pcs and I would like to make it into a NAS to backup my computers and have a centralized storage place, nothing fancy.
 I think it's a great machine, with i5-4570T 2.9GHz, 8GB of RAM and 500 GB SSD and it has a very low power consumption, but it lacks a good way to get a lot of storage connected, so I am wondering what would be a good way to set up storage and connect it to this tiny pc?
 I am thinking about picking up 3-4 WD Red 4TB drives and maybe putting them in an external enclosure of some sort, but I wanted to try and avoid connecting them via USB because of performance loss.

 I would like to get control over my home network. Currently every device in my household is connected to the router supplied by the ISP. This needs to change. Therefor I am looking for hardware recommendations to achieve the following goals:
  
VLAN sementation
 self hosted DNS for every VLAN (Pi-hole and Filter for smart TV etc.)
 WIFI and LAN
 VPN per MAC/association 
  
Would an enterprise solutions be the best? Maybe having two devices to enable a central firewall and having a wifi router is the solution. Any and all recommendations are welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 Recently I've been wondering how people bootstrap their lab environments. At work we have a lab that was setup before I started and they manually install vsphere/k8s(rancher) with out of tree management. This allows for spinning up VMs to be used as part of the cluster from rancher.
 However I noticed that rancher is spun up in a k8s cluster that is formed insider a docker container.
 IE docker-run->k8s cluster generated->rancher installed. This is a one liner from rancher for development testing. Then we have downstream clusters spun up inside vsphere via ranchers GUI.
 The reason for all this is "Cloud Agnostic", so we're not using a managed k8s service AKS/EKS etc.
 Anyway I was setting up a new home lab before I had an old r710 server with proxmox and did a lot of manual configuration, vm creation not fun.
 My new setup is 3 dell thin clients with proxmox all joined to a DC. Now aside from manually installing proxmox which I could've automated with PXE boot *I plan on testing PXE boot deploys now that I have proxmox setup*. I'd prefer not to be manually spinning up containers I know portainer is a popular tool for this but I'm considering a k8s enviroment. 
 What's your go to method for bootstrapping k8s? I know k8s is overkill for self-hosted but it's what's used at work so I'd like to make it more part of my daily.

 Let's say, I have an gmail account and I want to archive mails from there on my server.
 I imagine something like a pop3 account, pulling mails to mbox, from there you use restic, rsync or whatever to backup the current state.
 Is there a solution for that, or do I have to script it myself?

 I also got a synology ds2413+ from the local uni but cant seem to access it in any way ( it powers on and even has lan indicators but cant find it on my network)
 id like to run: Plex, raddar, sonnar, nextcloud, pihole and Backblaze, also some gaming servers as an extra bonus if possible.
 Im currently leaning towards getting a ddr4 mb/cpu and gutting the synology as its compact and has enough drive bays.
 also on a side note id like to get some low power devices to stream netflix youtube ect as the "smart" tv ads do my head in, was thinking a pi but not sure if they can handle 4k. 
 Edit: got a pi4 4gb as the 4k "receiver"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty large physical movie collection (mixture of blu-rays and 4k UHD blu-rays). 99% of the time I'm watching these movies at my PC on my 21:9 ultrawide monitor, so I started ripping the files off the disk and put them on an external drive.
 The problem is I have a mini-ITX PC that is already packed to the brim and can't fit any extra drives beyond the couple m.2 slots on the motherboard. I also don't have a lot of desk space to store a large desktop HDD, NAS, etc., etc. I decided on a 5TB portable USB-powered external, because at least at the time (and I think still now) that was the largest size I could get in that form factor). 
 When 4k blu-ray files are upwards of 60gb and regular blu's are like 30gb, a 5TB would fill up relatively quickly. So I started encoding the files using handbrake (for a number of reasons, but one being I could knock those file sizes down by at least half, if not more). 
 I'm using Nvidia NVenc to encode my files because it's a lot faster using the GPU vs CPU, but I've only just recently realized that the quality suffers. Tbh, it's not the worst thing in the world I've ever seen, but when I compare it to the original ripped movie file I can see the difference and now I can't live with it. 
 So, now I'm thinking I'm not going to encode at all and just gonna store the original movie files as is. I guess this means I'm gonna need a lot more than 5TB, though, but my problem still stands that I just don't have a lot of desk space for larger external drives. 
 The other issue is that anything more than those 2.5" portable drives usually require their own power brick and it will be nearly impossible for me to access an outlet at this point around my desk. 
 Do I have any options? Does anybody have any ideas or suggestions based on my restrictions?

 Recently I created a tracker system, useful to track value over time (e.g. I use it to track the gasoline price when I refuel my car, to track my weight, my car mileage, etc.)
 Both the backend and the react native app are open source.
 It's a really simple side project, I'm sure a lot of alternative are available, but if you want to use it or improve it, please feel free to do so!
 The backend is written in golang (simply because I wanted to better understand the language) and use docker container. While the frontend is written in typescript (react-native). 
 Sources: backend and frontend

 i have a HDD full of pdf, xlsx and docx files on a Linux server. All of the pdfs have an ocr layer. At the moment I access these files via smb and different clients (e. g. PDF Expert App on iOS or Finder on MacOS). Now I want to search for the content of pdf files but I can’t find a way to do this. Is there any software that creates an index on the server so that every client can access it and find files through this index? 
 Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there I need to upgrade my storage and just found out about the HBA card mentioned. I still have some questions and maybe you can help me with that. I found so many informations, that I am confused right now. 
 I am running a PC which is turned on 24/7 (Win 10). It also functions as a Plex Server. All SATA ports are occupied and there is no space left so I need to attach some more storage. 
 If I use the HBA adapter, is it possible to show every single HDD as an individual one, just by connecting them and power them in? Kind of plugging in 16 HDDs via USB or directly to a SATA port. File system would be NFTS. I was just wondering, cause I was always reading about JBOD, zfs etc. And acutely I do not want JBOD as of now. Maybe in the future when I upgrade my PC I was thinking about to switch to unRAID or something similar. 
 Thanks in advance :)

Looking at Passmark, they both score basically the same (1% difference) so are there any advantages to getting the 8100t over the 7500t given that there is 1 generation difference and they're both 4 core machines? I'll be using the machine as a NAS, Next Cloud and also running the *arrs and Emby (or Jellyfin) for now with more to come later.

From what I’ve seen, drobo is not doing great and a lack of support for this might put me in a bind in the near future. I’ve also heard these can mess up your drives but I don’t understand how. 
 Is it possible to use this as a DAS? Or even just a big ass external raid drive? 
 I can get something else for backup, but can I do this? Or is this thing useless at this point?
 Note: I’d like to use this for active video editing. Is it fast enough for that? (I’ve been using usb external drives so equivalent to that is fine)

 I am looking to downgrade my homelab setup (currently 120w idle) to something like a micro PC for power efficiency as I am a student, and energy is getting expensive for me in Australia. I have 4x2TB drives that I would like to utilize, however, the micro PCs can't accommodate more than one 2.5" drive.
 Can I connect a DAS to one of these systems? Currently interested in the Dell 3050 for its price here.
 I was looking at other power efficient fujitsu boards, but I cannot find any in australia, and they are out of my budget anyway.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers

 I'm talking about gigabytes.
 I'm a student who is also unemployed, and I don't have the money to keep anything in a paid cloud.
 I no longer have enough storage on my devices, therefore I need something to tide me over till I can afford a hard drive.

 I'm wondering about the security implications of this type of arrangement though. I heard about a DMZ as a way to stop people from trying to hack into servers, but I don't really know what that does or if it's necessary. How often should I apply patches and updates? Is there anything else I'm missing?

Of course, on top of that, I also have Owncloud with my Windows file shares mounted so that I can more easily access files with mobile devices or outside of my home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to buy the Coral AI Edge TPU (either the USB Accelerator version or the Mini PCIe Accelerator version), and it seems to be impossible to find something that is available soon and doesn't cost nearly double (or even triple) the regular price. And I am aware of the shortages as it has been the same exact experience for PC parts too (mainly GPUs), but is there no way to find a Coral AI Edge TPU that is closer to the original MSRP price?
 I reached out to Mousser, but their estimated ship date is May of 2024. Arrow electronics seems to have them available within the next 3 weeks, but you would need to purchase 1500+ units as they do not allow a single unit purchase.
 I really do want to try the Coral AI Edge TPU for things like Frigate and also Tensorflow. Does anyone have any creative idea on getting hands on one of these? Or is the best bet to sucker up and purchase one off Amazon for 2X the price?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world is a crazy place, and most of us only really know that because of the internet. I have been manually saving webpages of news webpages that tell stories I feel will be forgotten, or disappear.
 I currently archive these webpages by using Safari's "Save to PDF" function. It makes a really clean PDF with no page breaks. However, there isn't a keyboard shortcut for it by default, and the prompt that comes up asking where to save it has a delay, and saving a separate file with the original URL (with a similar filename so it can be correlated to its respective PDF) can only be done manually by dragging the URL bar to a Finder window.
 I currently have over 500 webpages in my queue. My existing methods get me through about 2.5 a minute, which is still absurdly long. I have a server where my data is, and can host nearly any OS. Is there any way I can expedite this process, or perhaps get a new one?
 I'm looking to render the webpage, not save cookies, save it as a PDF, and have that PDF have the URL on it, or a partnered process that saves the URL separately. Any help would be appreciated.

I know it does not have a M.2 PCIe slot on mobo itself, but the PCIe 3.0 x8 slot is available/open which would be great for a PCIe to M.2 adapter. The problem is the available/open x8 slot is directly underneath (maybe 10 cm) a GPU installed in the x16 slot (which is using a right angle PCIe adapter). Any ideas on creative ways to get a PCIe to M.2 adapter installed in that x8 slot so I can install a M.2 SSD drive (or two)??

I have gigabit internet from Spectrum and the modem has a 2.5Gbe port. I would like to utilize this to get the full overprovisioned speeds. I have tried the MikroTik S+RJ10 and the 10Gtek ASF-10G-T “for Mellanox” from Amazon. Neither of which have worked so far. The 10Gtek one worked fine in my Brocade switch but refused to link up when connected to the Mellanox card. I was wondering if anyone else has a similar setup to mine and knows of any NBase-T transceivers that will work.

I have a 3 drive bay in my PC and I want to make a raid array that will be for storing my movie collection, I may also use it to store things like backups. How would I go about this in the most cost affective way? I want 8tb of storage so would I get 2 4tb drives and an 8tb drive to mirror? If I were to go with that method would I run the array in raid 1? I still have plenty of power and sata slots for the drives, and I am planning on going with western digital red pros. Is this setup incorrect? Do all the drives have to be the same size for raid to work correctly?

 a short explanation of my setup:
 Hp proliant microserver with proxmox, -> openmediavault runs on it as NAS and for docker/portainer. uptime kuma and a few other containers (e.g. nextcloud, audiobookshelf, paperless, photoprism) are running here.
 A few services/containers partially access the internet via a reverse proxy.
 audiobookshelf, in particular, has repeatedly noticed extreme timeouts in the last few hours, BUT: only out of my own network. the monitor type is set to https - GET
 I have a extern vps on which uptime kuma is also running and entered the same URLs to check. with which it does not come to errors, or timeouts.
 ​
 what could be the reason? updates from containers or similar were not installed at the time the problems occurred. can I somehow check my internet connection? a ping command to my public ip from the vps only resulted in timeouts of 9-10 ms. feel free to write me any ideas.

My backup has plenty of space, so I want to set up regular backups of all of our desktops/laptops. I have used EaseUS ToDo backup in the past. And it worked ok. But something about it just doesn't feel right. Like it's "Chinese software just waiting to take my data" or something haha. That and I found that if I didn't keep an eye on it, it was complaining about being out of date, or has ads or whatever. I was debating about other options like just using Windows built in backup capabilites. Using the free version of Veeam and install the agent on each PC. Or Simply setting a batch file in a scheduled task to run robocopy to the backup share on a regular basis or at startup. This wouldn't get a system image level backup or retain history but at least files would be duplicated and easily accessible. Plenty of options out there and just wondering what everyone else does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For those who don't know, Xhamster deleted most of its old galleries about a year ago for reasons unknown to me. Since images from the deleted galleries still show up in image search and reverse image search results (and are retrievable in that way), I believe they still exist somewhere. Is there a reliable way to access the "lost" galleries in full?

Pre-OS X versions are available from WinWorldPC https://winworldpc.com/library/operating-systems
 Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah, 10.1 Puma, 10.2 Jaguar, and 10.3 Panther are also available from WinWorldPC https://winworldpc.com/product/mac-os-x/100
 Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, 10.8 Mountain Lion, 10.10 Yosemite, 10.11 El Capitan, and 10.12 Sierra are available from Apple (see this page) https://osxdaily.com/where-download-macos-installers/
  
However, I can't find downloads of:
  
10.4 Tiger
 10.5 Leopard
 10.6 Snow Leopard
 10.9 Mavericks
 10.13 High Sierra
 10.14 Mojave
 10.15 Catalina
 11 Big Sur
 12 Monterey
 13 Ventura
  
Would anyone know where to get these?
 I checked archive.org , but I don't know if someone could have uploaded malware...
 PS. I am not on Mac, so I don't know what to do with a "macappstore" link.

 What I would ideally want is the ability to have each user have their own page, which can have links added to it by an admin based on either individual user or by user group.
 I've looked through the usual sources such as the Awesome Self Hosted list, and found a number of nice looking start pages/dashboards. However, it didn't look like any of the ones I found supported multiple users.
 Does anyone know of any tools (maybe I need to look outside of "start pages") that might fit what I'm looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective: Replace buggy Marvell-based PCIe eSATA card with suitable SAS HBA in a Desktop computer running Windows 10 Pro, for use with individual drives in self-powered eSATA enclosures.
 Question: Can this support connecting SATA drives in external, self-powered eSATA connector enclosures that can be connected while the PC is booted up and Windows is running ? And conversely, will it be possible to disconnect such drives with the Windows option to "Safely Remove Hardware" while the PC is running?
 I've searched for hours and can't find answer to this question, but perhaps I'm not asking correctly, and this is actually a question of "Can you hot swap external drives connected to SAS HBA" ? 🤐 
 I realize most people are using HBA cards for more extensive, dedicated, always-on storage purposes. I really want to have option to connect SATA drives in external eSATA enclosures to my Win10 PC, AND have the option to attach them while Windows is running, and remove them using the Safely Remove Hardware option, also while Windows is running. I'd also like to be able to connect more than 2 at the same time.
 Your experience and guidance here will be VERY appreciated....THANKS !
 (The eSATA PCIe card currently installed, now causing problems: IOCrest/Syba SD-SA2PEX-2E )

And since I expect these are going to last me for quite awhile I want to make sure I'm kicking things off right. I'll be consolidating various other drives onto these and using some for clients.
 Would love it if some of you could share what you like to do to get a new drive up and running in terms of formatting, cluster sizes, surface tests, stress tests, smart tests, etc. 
 What got me thinking of this is u/Malossi167's comment in this thread (so thanks!). Would love to see what steps others use.
 For the record these are likely to remain unshucked, GPT formatted Windows drives. Thanks!

 i'm hosting a Matrix Synapse Server and we we are using Element as client since 2021. 
 I must say, element is really full of major bugs which take way to long to be fixed. The biggest problem are the inconsistent appearing bugs with authentification and encryption. The important implemented features dont work poperly. I've the feeling, the devs are focusing on nice-2-have features but not fixing the really really bad major bugs.
 ​
 So my question is: Are there any good selfhosting chat server alternatives for matrix with a good AND stable/ working client?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backstory
 I live in Europe and back in 2018 a friend of mine was in the US and picked up a few Easystore 8TBs for me. I shucked them all and put them in my Synology NAS. All worked bar one which could not be detected. I connected it back to my PC first using a WD Elements adapter/case (the Euro version of the Easystore) and the drive was not even detected. Then I used the Easystore "adapter" and it powered up but it was detected as a 2TB drive and I could do nothing with it. Windows Disk Manager said it needed to be initialized but threw an error when I tried. WD Utilities said the SMART test failed and that I had apparently entered a password wrong 5 times. The only option was to Erase but then it threw an exception with no details when I tried that. It was a legit disk too, not one that someone had swaped out and sent back to the store. Since I was not in the US and I had shucked it I assumed I would get no help from WD and put it in a box and forgot about it.
 So now in 2022 its out of warranty and I am curious if there is anything I can do to revive it? Amazingly I still had the adapter from the Easystore case attached to it. I plugged it in again today and it was the same as before. I dont hear any funny sounds either. It spins up when I connect it to the computer, shows up in Disk Manager, still as 2TB but I still cant do anything with it.
 One thing I am not sure about is whether the Easystore adapter I am using is the one that came with the 8TB drive. I had a batch of Easystore 3TB drives previously and it may be from those so maybe that is having trouble with the 8TB drive. The product id is 25fb firmware revision 3004 according to WD Utilities

 I am trying to see if there is a simple way to mass-export articles. I've been playing around with IMPORTXML in GoogleSheets, while I have been able to pull dates, titles, descriptions, images of articles, I have been unable to pull the actual article content itself.
 For context, I'm basically working on a passion project of some transcripts of a podcast I like, that I wanted to print and bind for personal reading. There are over 50 posts so I was curious if there was some way to mass export these. I'm dreading copying and pasting the content from each article. 
 I should note that I am not a developer and know nothing about writing/running scripts. Hoping there might be an easy way for a novice to pull this. 
 ​
 Thank you for any help or direction!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My team have an upcoming project where we have to upload videos from our conference every day to an s3 bucket so other members of our team can then download and edit those videos at a later time.
 We have a 1GB/s wired network connection and are looking to max it out when uploading the rather large files (20-40gb/ea) to S3.
 My question is- what software is the fastest to upload to S3? It is probably a Mac, but we should have access to a Windows box if needed. It has to be a GUI as the user is somewhat technical, but not comfortable with the command line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm really enjoying the features of the whole Jackett/Sonarr/Radarr/Qbittorrent fun club and the automation it provides but I find the actual discovery of films and TV to be really lacking.
 Is there a webui for browsing and finding media that can connect to my apps, possibly with RT and Metacritic scores? They really nailed down the app if you know what you want... but what if you want to browse?
 Are there browser apps that can just send calls to Sonarr and Radarr from RT, IMDB or Metacritic?
 Edit: I went with Jellyseer and a Firefox plugin for Sonarr/Radar. Still no scores but the browsing is what you'd expect.

 a bundle of three older netapp JBODs (including disks see image)
 1. NetApp Unnamed 24bay 2.5" 2x IOM6 Sas controllers and 15x 600gb
 2. NetApp FS2040 with 12x 600gb
 3. NetApp DS14M4 with 14x 300gb
 For 250€ / 250 USD
 I am not sure if this is a good deal tho, but i am thinking of it bc i got a bunch (like 25x 3.5" 3tb) Sas drives laying around i dont really have a place for since i am usually only using higher capacity exos drives in my newer servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been managing my clients cPanel emails for years now and never have I ever had a dropout in services, all emails have been received by the recipient. Some email provider, that shall remain anonymous, that I'm using for my business email had a couple of hour long dropouts in services in the past couple of months where I could not send or receive emails while the cPanel emails kept on ticking without a problem.
 Dropouts can happen even in big companies so I thought to myself - Why not? Why shouldn't I host my own email?
 I have a VPS with a dedicated clean IP (I have checked has not been in any blacklists recently). I am confident enough that I can configure everything well enough to get a good score on mail-tester.com with mailcow docker deployment.
 I plan to first test it on my own domain and then after everything checks out migrate the clients one by one.
 What can go wrong?

 ​
 So after I tried it, I noted is the same free version, but without your data going out. 
 So after a little Google-Fu, I've discovered LibreGrammar, community a fork from LanguageTool, but with all premium features enabled, and works with the extensions as the vanilla server. 
 I'm trying right now, and now shows the passive voice suggestions, the only drawback is a little outdated from the upstream.

Who here actually uses it as a portfolio for what they know to show to potential employers. I’m still in Highschool (16) and got my first job over the summer working for the IT director of my school. I got to do it with my friend and made really decent money ($15 an hour). And used some of that money to make my Homelab completely overkill for someone my age. I learned some basic web development and created a homepage for my homelab domain (broomfieldhomelab.net) and am thinking of sending it to my IT director to see if it’s applicable to put on a resume for when I get a ‘real’ job after I graduate. Does anyone else here use their lab as a showing point for their skills?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm bringing online a 12GBPS SAS Jbod with 90 18tb drives on it and am stuck trying to decided between a couple deployment scenarios. 
 I can deploy with a 1950x (16 core threadripper) or a more modern 5950x (16 core ryzen) both with 128gb of ram. I was leaning to the thread ripper as i'm not entirely sure i'm going to run anything on the host much beyond the OS and the 5950x has a better resell value should I decide to sell it. Any real reason to go 5950x over the thread ripper? Power consumption isn't really an issue. 
 I've got a bunch of systems in play already here (with about 1/4 of 2pb used across a few Supermicro builds / jbods) that i'm going to consolidate here. I'm thinking once I get the data over (I have serious data backed up in two off site locations) i'm going to rebuild the other systems into a ceph cluster. For now, i'm debating truenas or proxmox with zfs pools. I'm thinking 10 of 9 drives with one hotspare per, but i'm open to other suggestions. 
 Feel free to tell me where I'm probably making the wrong decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm wondering if these specs would be good for a new server me and a friend are making. We're going to be using it for virtual machines whose uses will be web-hosting, file/media storage, a few low spec gaming VMs, game servers (Minecraft etc.) and maybe some machine learning. 
 We're also wondering how to set it up, such as which hypervisor to use as well as how we can pass through/split the GPU between multiple VMs, or can the card only be dedicated to 1 VM?
 We're wanting to keep it desktop sized (E-ATX) so it fits on my desk and so that we don't have tiny, 15 000 000 000 rpm fans, if we were to get a rack mounted server.
 Last thing, we don't need over the top storage, just a decent sized SSD and a couple of TB HDD(s), but the prices seem quite high (the HDD included in the specs below are barracuda 4TB). Does anyone know of some cheap HDD alternatives?
 Thanks for any help
 
  
Motherboard: jingsah x99 dual f2: £160
 CPUs: 2x Xeon e5 2670 v3, 12 cores, 24 threads, 3.1GHz, 120W TDP: £60 for both
 RAM: 2x 32GB (64GB) DDR4 2400MHz ECC: 2x£45 (£90)
 Case: DeepCool MATREXX 55 Mesh E-ATX, supports E-ATX: £44
 PSU: 850W Corsair, Modular, Gold Rated, has the 2x8pins we need for CPUs: £99
 Storage Drives: 1TB m.2 + 2x4TB HDD : £71 + 2(£80) = £231
 GPU: Asus Strix gtx 1080 8GB: £205
 Switch: Netgear GS305E 5x1Gps ports: £20
 Coolers: 2x DEEPCOOL GAMMAXX GT BK: 2x £35 (£70)
 Fans: upHere 6x 120mm in 1 pack with fan hub: £30
  
 
 Total without drives: £778 With drives: £1009 (I could look for some cheaper drives/get some second hand if they're in good condition)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Picked up this wanworx by ecessa router to use for pfsense for my home. I was hoping it was less proprietary inside, but I did not luck out.... ecessa has no hardware info posted, but luckily I figured out its similar to a Lanner Fw 7582, and they have a user manual! It details all the headers on the motherboard thankfully and specifications. 
 Box came with pfsense installed, 4gb ddr3 ram, i5 3.0ghz, and a 50gb ssd. Also has an expansion module with 4 additional NIC. Appears to be a pcie x8 interface so maybe in the future I can use a pcie riser and plop a fiber interface in the rear card slot if I ever want to upgrade. 
 My plans are to use it for pfblockerng and openvpn for remote access. 
 One fun thing I ran into is I want to pull the expansion module, no need for it drawing power, but then it changes the interface numbering (I think) so I can't access the LAN configuration screen of pfsense. I'll have to work on that and make a serial cable for the console port.
 Anyone have much experience with these? Are they decent?

 I believe they are some performance benefits with 4Kn. I will be using the drive with TruENAS scale (Linux)
 Some manufacturer like Seagate and WD allows for drive conversion.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm going to be buying the following:
 Synology DS920+
 1 WD Ultrastar 20tb drive (or red, still researching and deciding which to get)
 And then 3 more HDs of varying size
 ​
 Not really relevant but I'll be using this to host my plex server I share with friends+family, videos I shoot myself (hobbyist videographer and photographer), and general data storage such as programs, games maybe, the works. 
 ​
 Question is the ds920+ is $549.99, Ultra star is $386, and a 12tb ultrastar is $210 at the moment.
 ​
 I'm willing to pay these prices but I'd just get salty if I pull the trigger on all that stuff now and then in a month I go back and look at all the money I could have saved. I also don't even know if stuff like this goes on sale during the holidays (pretty sure hds do but not familiar enough to say for sure)
 ​
 So ya, what do you guys think I should do!

 I'm very interested in downsizing my home lab, which right now is a great power sink and space heater.
 I'm interested if anyone has used these beelink tiny computers, and if they like them, or had experience with it and running ESXI. My review of the reviews didn't show anyone running it with ESXI, so my initial guess was this model is relatively new, or maybe it's not too popular for home labbers? I had originally looked at the Intel NUC, but to get these specs I'd pretty much have to double the price.
 I prefer ESXi because it's what I'm running now and have that momentum, but could migrate to something else if this hardware wouldn't work.
 Appreciate any thoughts from the community.

 A friend of mine complained that the internet speed was too low, speed test gives 30mbs down but he's subscribed for 250. The ISP sent a technician and he disconnected the coaxial cable from the combo modem/router and connected it to a handheld testing device and said that the speed at the cable is 1000 mbs, so it is even higher than the subscription, hence the problem is with the router. 
 While this maybe true that the modem/router combo has an issue, but my question is what is this device? And can it really read a speed? Or just cable quality?
 I have been trying to lookup the device that can read internet speed at the coaxial cable but can't find anything

Is there some software I can spin up on my server to stream from? My thoughts are that I could connect a cell phone to my server, the phone captures the video and sends to the server, the server records the video and Livestreams it to a public url.
 Normally I would do more research before asking here but given the circumstances I thought I would ask for suggestions. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not a significant hoarder, but I do have a TB or two that would be better on archive storage. Some are old (gone) machine backups, phone backups, training videos I wanted to make sure were not lost. Other than periodic confirmation the archives are ok I have no need to access them.
 Does anyone use Amazon's long term storage like Glacier? https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/
 For still readily available, milliseconds to few hours, a TB is about $5/mo. I hate a monthly fee; however to know that is taken care of could be worth it. With that and a local hard drive I would feel comfortable about the data.
 There is even a long-term, slow access (12 hours), for about $1/TB/mo. Ultimately this is probably what most of my data needs, but I need to get comfortable with it first.
 Any opinions of Glacier? Are there other similar services that are good/better/cheaper?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 I'm looking to extend my Dell T420 host with a single 2TB PCIe NVMe drive, to be used as a datastore in ESXi (alongside the existing RAID 10 of 8 x 7.2k spinning rust). 
 Initially this will just be used to host the boot drives of some VMs which are sluggish on the current RAID, but I'd also like the freedom to put some more IO-heavy (aka disk-thrashing) workloads on here in the near future, without worrying about having to buy a new NVMe drive every year.
 Anyone got any recommendations for high-endurance PCIe NVMe drives, with good access times and 3Gbps throughput (and which haven't done sneaky business like downgrading components for the same drive model)? 
 Cheers in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Use case:
 I volunteer as a driver for a non-profit meals delivery organization. They're currently managing it via Google Sheets, and Google Maps 🫣. I'd like to propose to them a solution (if it exists) that can house their data (delivery destinations, meal types, routes, etc.). 
 This would primarily be used by the back-office folks, but bonus if there's a mobile interface that the drivers could use to help track their deliveries, mileage, etc. 
 I'm hoping there's a OOTB solution, but I'm not opposed to looking at helping customize something as well (I'm think a CRM, as that's what it basically seems to be - I've installed Odoo and am starting to play around in it). 
 Would love your thoughts!
 Thanks!

 Should I format my the drive I plan to clone the data on ?
  
I plan to use this docking station to make a copy a drive.
 Disk A -> Cloned to Disk B -> Uploaded to off-site server -> snapshots made everyday 
 Do I need to know anything before proceeding like this ?

 I currently use iCloud since forever and which i like. And since iCloud is owned by Apple, i think it pretty much is future proof but i heard that its not actually cloud backup service but more like a sync service or something like idk if thats true or not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having gotten done with my NAS, I now installed two 12TB drives internally in my desktop PC. They’re not the main drives - my primary C: drive is a striped set of SSDs. But the new drives, for lack of any motivation one way or another, I’ve setup as RAID0. My motherboard handles the RAID and so now I’ve got a single 24TB volume in Windows. I’m using Win7 Pro still but that’s fine. The usage for this drive will be a lot of virtual machines, as well as a junk drive for downloading and parsing through gobs of data to save what I want and trash the rest. Aside from that, no idea… whatever the future holds. I’m also getting a RAM upgrade in a few days I’ll be installing new chips and get myself up to 32GB RAM. Mostly to accommodate running a bunch of VMs. 
 So, my question is: do you think raiding them is overkill and unnecessary, and should I instead make them jbods? I’ve had this machine for quite a few years already and the mobo has done a great job with my C drive raid, so I don’t really have any worries about messing up an array due to anything other than actual damage. 
 I’m just trying to make the best decision now, before the drive starts to really accumulate a lot of data. 
 Thanks for any opinions you may have.

I have my beyond important files synced to google, but that doesn't help me much in the event of me needing to redeploy a container in a pinch when my home network is out.
 Bought a PiBox loaded it with omv/docker/portainer and a pair of mirrored ssds. Is there a way to automate backing up the dockers from my other machines and run certain backups as redundant containers that can act independently if connected to another network?

 I have considered SSH'ing into my home machine but there are no ports open on their machines. 
 I've seen some tools such as chrome remote desktop but the ones I've seen either require either a plugin on the control machine, (which would not be possible) or a confirmation from the host machine, (also not possible of course).
 I am considering the possibility of setting up a site which allows for control of a remote environment. No sensitive files would be present so security concerns aside... Am I thinking along the right tracks? Would this solution be trivial? Sub-optimal?
 Any advice would be appreciated. I have investigated many options but they all seem to assume that the non host machine /network are not entirely locked down. Many thanks.

 I plan on upgrading in the near future though. Thinking about two drives somewhere in the realm of 6-10TB.
 Once I do that, I'll probably be buying an enclosure like a QNAP TR-002, which would be hardware RAID.
 My question is, is hardware RAID more desirable than software RAID? And should I be worried about my current software RAID setup on Windows?

But I am really annoyed by the clicking sounds when the drive is working (relatively silent when idle). I know this sound level is typical of enterprise-class HDDs though.
 In Germany, all the cheapest drives (cost per TB) are enterprise-class, which makes me wonder where all the consumer drives are? They don't make those anymore?
 What choice do I have if I want to outfit my PC with around 40-60TBs of storage while not having to endure the noise levels of enterprise drives? 40-60TB of SSDs would be too expensive.
 Any input would be much appreciated. Cheers

 I have chosen Hetzner to run all of this. Currently I have Jitsi Meet on jitsi.domain-one.tld and Tactical RMM on domain-two.tld. domain-two.tld is not going to be advertised, it's just for convenience and separation of services. domain-one.tld currently has no front page.
 I'm going to print some ads, go around town and put them on bulletin boards in local shops, libraries and so on. What I need is some nice front page where a potential customer can have some basic info and contact me. Hoping for some spam protection as well but something very simple a grandma can handle.
 All ideas are very welcome. How would you set this type of thing up? Very curious what others have done. Billing is handled by a 3rd party so I'm putting the customer data on their site and they send the bills via email.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning to buy a 2TB hard drive, after searching I found that Toshiba P300 Provides CMR. Then I also found that the model has these two different-looking drives. Some website selling these two drives shows that for Drive-A they provide 3-years of warranty (not sure if it's correct or if they just did not update the site) and for Drive-B, they provide only a 1-year of warranty. 
 I am not sure what is the difference between them and which one should I go for.

 Drive-A

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a solution where I can automatically sync files between different devices and share between multiple users. One of my biggest use cases is backing up photos from mobile phones.
 I've been looking at Nextcloud and owncloud and I can't decide which would be best.
 As far as I can tell they can both be selfhosted and both are free for personal use.
 Both look to support LDAP (which I use so people only have to manage one username and password).
 Does anyone have any opinions on either option, good or bad?

 After installing it yesterday I was looking for that and found out that this is (now?) a OpenFaaS Pro exclusive feature.
 Before I lock myself in the (Open)FaaS ecosystem, I wanted to ask if there are alternatives for scale to zero you know of? It's just a charming idea that a small function doesn't idle most of the time when it's only invoked 5 times a day - while not important enough to get pro subscription for that.
 PS: I wasn't even able to find a price for OpenFaaS Pro. Does anyone have an idea or do I have to get called by them to find out the cost?

So, soon i will be building local server and since i don't have much experience in that field i decided to search online. More i looked deeper into the pit i fallen. Now i don't even about OS that i will use. I am used to Windows environment so i didn't even think about other options. To cut to the point, i will be having 12 (or 10) HDD's of 18TB, that i wanted to put into raid 10 but after searching through here i dont know anymore if its good idea. I need single volume of at least 60TB, that will have decent performance and be used by 5-10 people at any given time. (OS would go on separate drives). Files that go through the server are usually around 200MB on avg, but can go as high as 15-20GB's. Thank you in advance.

 Is there a way to archive a copy or somehow download all posts (plus the comments on each post)? When I requested my data from reddit, all they did was let me download a zip file with a bunch of confusing excel spread sheets which are essentially useless.
 Anyone have ideas on how to preserve my reddit account history to have a backup of all the data I've shared in my posts throughout the years? I really appreciate any insight, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I upgraded my personal computer and NAS with Mellanox CX512A, from ConnectX-2 and -3. Before the upgrade I've been getting speeds very, very close to 10 Gb/s.
 NAS is Intel S5520HC (dual LGA1366 X5690) with 192 GB of RAM, and the card sits in PCIe 2.0 x8 slot. It's running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
 PC is Z170/i7 desktop with 64 GB of RAM, with the card sitting in PCIe 3.0 x4 slot, and Win10 Pro 21H2. I have 25G DAC cable and both ethtool and Windows betwork panel pick up the connection as 25Gb/s. In both cases cards have sufficient airflow, in a form of a 140 mm 2000 rpm fan blowing over all PCIe devices.
 iperf3 -p 1 shows ~8.3 Gb/s, while -p 4, usually slightly lower, 7.9-8.1 Gb/s. File transfer peaks at ~700 MB/s to ramdisk over SMB and ~730 MB/s over NFS (that's from NVMe, of course).
 I don't see particularly high CPU usage on either side.
 I tried enabling RDMA, but it dropped speeds by around 1 Gb/s.
 I must admit this is not an upgrade I have expected. I do understand that my hardware is not exactly compatible (half PCIe connectivity on both platforms), but both 2.0 x8 and 3.0 x4 deliver around 4 GB/s bandwidth to each of the devices, and I do understand that Windows is not exactly the best system for high speed networks, but maybe there is something I can do in this situation that will help with transfer speed?

However, not everything on my network is listed there. From the UI of my router, I can make some of the dynamic DHCP clients static, which makes them queryble from DNS server in router. I want CoreDNS to fall back to the router dns if nothing found in db.my.domain. 
 As an example, dig @corednsip myphone.my.domain returns NXDOMAIN but dig @routerip myphone.mydomain returns expected IP, which makes me believe that coredns is ignoring forward if it first tries file.

 I am hoping someone can shed some light on this problem. I have included snapshots of (1) Storage Spaces window and (2) Windows Explorer.
 I have added new drives to both Storage Spaces: One is two-way mirror and the other is simple.
 My expectation is that explorer should represent the same free space. Am I doing anything wrong?
 When I go to the 'change' option, it won't let me increase the size of available space.
 Any help would be much appreciated and if further information is required, please let me know. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have researched this many times over the years and find more and more great solutions emerging each year. I stopped hosting in 2015 because I moved to a location with no broadband internet and the best solution I had was a tethered cell phone with terrible speed and CGNAT. Now I have T-mobile unlimited home internet with 130-230 down and 20-35 up. So I have the speed for it, but still no port forwarding.
 Now here are the solutions and resources research has pointed out to me. Just curious which of them are better choices in current times. I will be hosting multiple VM's/containers including plex to a few users for music and occasional video. Also hosting cloud storage for a few cell phones to store photos and videos for freeing up local storage on devices. And home assistant which I currently pay the cloud fee for and that cost can go towards a more global solution
 ngrok - already using the free one of this for plex which is great. Wish the paid version was priced down a little more, but still open to it.
 cloudflare - looks very popular and similar to ngrok and priced similar.
 localXpose - have not tried but looks similar to ngrok, but more affordable.
 portmap io - looks to be like the above but uses openvpn to which I could setup on my router directly.
 openvpn to a friend/family router to use there ipv4 port forwarding and free DDNS - This is probably what I would have done years ago before the tunneling solutions above became mainstream. Honestly still open to this too though.
 VPS with VPN - have only lightly researched this one. Was going to test on my free AWS account, but read that it gets expensive if much data is uses across AWS, so would need a cheaper host.
 unknown - A wiser choice I am overlooking?

 I got a ransom some months ago losing all the data, but i had never made a server before so i'd no idea on how to secure it.
 Maybe my error is open the rdp port on the windows rdp service.
 THe only thing someone told to me is that i need a vpn.
 So i'm here to ask for advices, what i should do? I should buy a router in order to make an OpenVPN or similar vpn on that server?
 i should not use the windows rdp to connect to my machine (that is windows 10)?
 I should buy a cheap vps to make a reverse proxy?
 I should install docker to make "containers" for each thing i use (game server, sftp, rdp for blender, etc)?
 I need to use also somehting for SFTP to save data (images, videos, projects, etc) in my HDDs, what should i do?

The first card was running the full Dell RAID firmware so I pulled down the LSI 20.00.07 firmware, flashed it, and after rebooting it sees my individual drives as expected. This card is still dropping alerts on the console that one chip is at 51C and the other chip is at 59C.
 The second card was running LSI IT firmware v13, and even though it already saw my connected drives I flashed it with the same new firmware, rebooted, and confirmed all four chips between both boards are running the new firmware. Oddly, the second board is no longer reporting the temperature, and it was running at 50C/66C so it's definitely above the threshold that should be reported. This board is also in the slot against the side of the case and is surrounded by the framework so I expected it to be running hotter anyway.
 Now this second board was also running the oldest firmware, but considering its position I don't think a firmware change could really drop the temps down below what the first card (which is more in the open and getting better airflow) is reporting.
 So I'm stumped. All four chips were flashed from the same firmware file (I also flashed the onboard PERC H710 from the same file) so I don't understand why one board would stop reporting the high temps while the other board still shows them. The test drives I plug into each controller are detected and reading just fine so I know the hardware is all working. I haven't been able to find a CLI utility that will give me the temps directly from the cards but I feel like something may have gone wrong so I want to at least be able to confirm the readings.
 So does anyone have suggestions for why this card stopped reporting the temps, and/or a utility I can grab to verify the actual temps? Thanks.

On my Mac in 2019 I finished a project and moved a whole folder out of Google Drive, including some Google Sheets to the local RAID where I was archiving project assets. Turns out those .gsheets were removed from Google Drive and the .gsheet local files are just empty aliases pointing to nothing. Opening them on desktop brings up a 404. Reuploading them yields no preview and no data. Don't repeat my mistake.

I buy all my drives on either serverpartdeals, newegg, or amazon and it seems all of those are considered OEM. When i tried to RMA a 2-year-old HGST 12TB they said it's OEM, its not covered by a warranty. Has any one else had a different experience with HGST/WD? What is your experience with Seagate on OEM drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mattermost is very similar to Slack/Teams--but it does not have a persistent voice room the way that Discord/Mumble does, so I am using a plugin for that. The plugin was recently archived on Github, but I tried the same version from the most recent release along with the version of Mattermost that would have been the most recent at the time, and I am having the same problem as the person does in this Issue thread (The heading of the voice channel area appears, but the actual channels do not populate).
 I am running Debian 10 on Digital Ocean, and PostgreSQL (I didn't think the db mattered, but I had never heard of that, and I only used it because I was following along someone else's instructions and they used it, so I thought I'd mention that).
 https://i.imgur.com/3XleCd1.png
 The solution that worked for the issue I posted above was that they had to add the listen port into the setting for the site URL. I opened this port, and I tried all combinations of versions of the Mattermost client + plugin, with and without this port in the URL, HTTP and HTTPS, and I am losing my mind not knowing what else to try. I am very new to Linux and very new to server configurations, so I just don't even know where to begin troubleshooting. Only now as I type this I realize that I never tried to downgrade the server, which could work.... If anyone has any tips on doing this with as little damage as possible, I would love the words of advice. 
 Also, the log file does not appear to have anything terribly helpful or out of place. It all looks to be loading the modules as normal with no issues. There are a ton of log files in my Mattermost folder, if there is a specific one I should focus on for this and look more closely at, please share.
 Or if anything jumps out at you that I could try before I downgrade the server, that would be great as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use some S3 compatible object storages (minio at my home network, wasabi on the cloud) where I backup my Android phone photos and some files on my nix-on-droid that I do not keep on git. 
 But the photos, specially, are very hard to distinguish by the name the camera app gives to them. A "file manager web ui/app" that can show image thumbs and allow me to more quickly (batch) manage the files on the bucket would be a dream. I know both Minio and Wasabi have a WebUI, but I find both archaic and too rudimentar for this purpose.
 So, my questions:
 1) Does anyone on this sub know a self-hosted app (supporting docker-compose, CasaOS or portainer stacks would be awesome) that I can use to do that? (not restricted to photos only, that was just an example ;)
 2) Not exactly self-hosted, but do you know if Nextcloud paid service supports that - case I go the lazy route but wish to help fund an open source company? 
 Thank you very much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Decided to start about 2 weeks ago from scratch, I have been learning basic linux (Ubuntu) and it has been going pretty well overall.
 I've started and restarted a few times when things start to get messy or confusing and a few tools in particular have been complete game changers. Specifically Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer both are huge headache savers.
 One thing I haven't been able to find that I really like is a straight forward web based server management tool. I've only really found cockpit which is kind of the right idea but seemed to cause some weird issues when I started experimenting with its containers.
 Question 1) Does anyone have a recommendation for an alternative to cockpit that at least will handle basic server monitoring (resources and whatnot) as well as have access to a terminal for jumping in for quick checks and whatnot.
 Question 2) Does anyone have a VPN suggestion? I just need something with basic functionality
 Question 3) Can I set up transmission only to use the VPN? It's in its own portainer container if that helps

 Please bear in mind MakeMKV was used to convert to MKA files and then converted them to WAV in Foobar2000, and while they were mostly good they still didn't hold up to the audio that plays when running the ISO file. I'm guessing converting the ISO to DSF and then WAV or FLAC would be the best way to do this? I'd appreciate any help on this because, honestly, I'm tired and lost of looking for the right way AND tools to do this.

 Being able to run up a game server, or use it as a CICD runner, or have it as NAS and Plex server etc,
 but more importantly i wanna be able to possible to host as a back end server and maybe UI host too. 
 But to digress, i just want something easy and quick and dirty, is it ok to just run WIndows Server OS, Docker and just spin up all the conatiners i need? Would i be missing anything? is there another software i need for spinning up VMs? would a hypervisor type OS be THAT much more worth it in the end? just looking for some more insight

 Ideally something that can take a few networks in CIDR format

 and show currenttly listed ip-addresses and ip-addresses that have been removed from blacklists today/within the current month? (Something similar to what hetrixtools or debouncer does?)

 So, I have 1tb of various private things (porn, memes etc) I'd like to keep on the cloud for easy access and viewing. I have a bunch of OneDrive space, but I've heard plenty of horror stories regarding people's accounts being shut down due to just private porn and would not like to risk the same fate. 
 Solution 1: Use cyberduck to encrypt and store in normal cloud. Unfortunately, this means if I simply want to view a file, I would have to use cryptomator to decrypt said files. I've had issues using cryptomator on its own due to sync issues. (Besides unsure if their ios and android app is any good) 
 Solution 2: Nas? Would be perfect however my technical skills are completely non-existent. I'd be happy to hire someone here locally to set it up but information on it already feels overwhelming. 
 Solution 3: Just say fuck it and store it unencrypted? 
 Not sure what you guys would recommend but yeah. Maybe this "perfect & seamless but also encrypted access" set up doesn't exist. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently repurposed my gaming rig (9400f, 16gb RAM, 1660TI) into a secondary server running RHEL9. I have taken a liking to running software as containers and particularly taken a liking to Podman due to just how easy it is to get going running unprivileged containers and some other nifty things such as systemd integration and generate/play kube.
 My first old server is under very heavy load, has no dedicated GPU and runs Plex in a Windows VM. I've been thinking of migrating Plex to this RHEL9 rig. What are the pros and cons of running Plex on Linux as a native RPM package vs a podman container? Some people report trouble getting NVIDIA hardware acceleration to work with Podman, but looking at various instructions it doesn't seem THAT hard (although obviously a fair bit more involved than just having NVIDIA drivers installed).
 What about the required NVIDIA container runtime, does it essentially replace the runtime provided by Podman or does it only affect containers specifically utilizing NVIDIA hardware? How well supported things are, is it safe to just have the system automatically update all OS updates + NVIDIA drivers (DKMS) + NVIDIA container-related packages?

However through a lot of reading I ended up finding out about the Blackmagic Design Intensity Pro 4k, which instead uses breakout cables attached to MORE breakout cables to capture S-Video.
 The Intensity Pro does seem somewhat more capable than the CE310B, but I am worried that introducing so many adapters is going to degrade the signal quality. After all, the breakout cables are using RCA connectors, which S-Video was deliberately designed to circumvent. I'm just a bit skeptical and was hoping someone could shed some light on whether or not that would be an issue, and of course I am also open to other capture card recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having a hard time finding my specific scenario anywhere. I currently have a segmented L2 network but it's overtaxing my pfSense firewall. I am switching my Cisco SG300 with an ICX-6610 and want to have my trusted high-speed VLANs routed via L3 on the switch while keeping some on the firewall.
 DHCP/DNS is handled on Windows Server. I know I have to create router interfaces for my 4 trusted VLANs, change DHCP option 3 to the IP of that interface and then as it becomes the gateway for those devices, they will route on the switch. 
 If I ping a device on VLAN 200-Storage from VLAN 20-Trusted, it would work. However, what happens when a device on VLAN 20 wants to ping a device on VLAN 30-IoT? The rules on the firewall allow that, but how do I ensure what is NOT going to my L3 VLANs get routed to pfSense? 
 In other words, I want 4 of my VLANs to be L3 and everything else to be L2 with policy-based routing. I also want my L3 VLANs to be able to communicate with my L2 VLANs.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello people. I have been trying to find the perfect EPG grabber, but everything seems to be missing some nice features. So, I decided to fork Guide2go and add the features that, I believe, were missing.
 So far, I added:
 — The EPG guide includes a Live/New icon for premiere shows and movies. Guide2Go does this natively, however, players like Titivate won't read XML tags. This solves that problem.
 — Added an EPG server. Now, Guide2Go will grab images from SD and act as a server for those images; it will download the images and cache them locally to avoid kill calling SD API. This is very useful for clients like Plex or Emby. Very similar to what 123EPG does (Actually, not similar, but the same feature).
 — Added the option to not download the images locally, but to call SD API every time a client needs an image. This is useful if you only have one or two clients with few EPG days downloaded. If you have many channels, this will not work for you. SD has a limit in the number of images that can be downloaded directly.
 ​
 I accept constructive criticism in the Code, I am not a developer by any means. So, expect some weirdness in my code.

However, my initial expectation was that I would be able to open the parts separately, and pull files that are only in that part, so if I need something that's on just one or two discs, I don't need to rip all ten discs. Is this possible? Is it not possible with 7z but is possible with another archive format? And will that archive format split files across 2 parts allowing exact byte amount parts, or will it never split files across multiple archives to retain independent part access? (I'm okay with splitting files to maximize space, just not having to rip 10 discs to access the contents of 2)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am familiar with self hosting one service - Nextcloud or PiHole - from home.
 I'd like to self-host three services :
  
Jitsi (Zoom alternative)- to host approx 15 people at a time
 Nextcloud - to serve around 15 people
 Jellyfin - to host about 2T of videos and audios
  
I am thinking to use Digital Ocean, Linode or some alternative(looking for recommendations)
 The question:
 What is the best way(price and computational powers) to go about this :
 - All three services on one server (is this difficult to do)
 - Three separate servers
 ​
 And any general advice on hosting, will also be gratefully received
 Thank you

I use a Synology NAS so in order for it to work, instead of using the PUID/PGID I normally would for my admin profile, I had to use the root credentials in order for the permissions to be approved. This is what my stack looks like
 version: "3" services: file-browser: image: filebrowser/filebrowser container_name: file-browser user: 0:0 ports: - 4000:80 volumes: - /volume1:/srv - /volume1/docker/filebrowser/filebrowser.db:/database.db restart: unless-stopped 
 I have read this post which is on this sub regarding setting this up using command runner. If I apply 
 /bin/sh -c 'if [[ "$FILE" != "/srv/Trash/"* ]]; then mv $FILE /srv/Trash; fi' 
 to the before delete area, update it and create a 'Trash' folder using filebrowser, I get a 500 internal error. If I create a 'Trash' folder by mounting a new share from my NAS GUI, then it resolves the 500 internal area. However when I am able to delete again, the file is not moved to the trash folder that was created. I have no idea where the files go other then being completely destroyed. Does anyone have an idea of what I should do to get the recycle feature to work using the command runner?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a smallish tech firm. We do many things including computer repair(even board level repair), software troubleshooting, etc. While we have a fair number of residential customers, we've also got a number of commercial clients for whom we do not only the aforementioned, but also managed backups. A typical client setup would be a Synology Diskstation to match their needs along with a Synology C2 cloud account. We have their workstations use Synology's 'Active Backup for Business' which will backup workstations on our schedule with whichever backup scheme we set up. The NAS itself will use Synology's 'Hyper Backup' to then back itself up to the Synology C2 cloud storage - whew... that's a lot of Synology stuff, and I rather dislike that.
 I'd rather have something less monolithic in the event Synology changes something down the road(for example pricing), forcing me to change gears. Given the above use case, what would be your go-to setup?
 Follow-up question: In my office, I too use a Synology DS, and with that I also use the Synology Office productivity suite which I would describe as 'decent, but no Google Docs'. Do you all have any luck with NextCloud with regards to a Google replacement? What type of hardware do you run?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My homelab is loud... loud enough to be heard on the first floor even though it's in the basement. It also probably accounts for 70% of the electric bill. Understandably my family looked at it as the obnoxious money-sink in the basement that could only be used for sketchy activities. However, after looping my family into three applications I self-host, the complaints have stopped and I have achieved homelab immunity! Those are:
  
Plex. Shouldn't come as a surprise to most, but having an increased catalogue of content really spices up movie nights, and with tv shows for days there's less time to complain to me.
 Zoneminder. The ability to keep track of the house while away, practically unlimited recording, and no monthly fees with an Android app sold my averagely tech savvy parents. They feel peace of mind knowing that data is not going to the cloud and is controlled by another nefarious entity instead, me.
 Bitwarden. When I told my mom she didn't have to store her passwords in an excel sheet anymore I swear I saw a glimmer in her eyes. Not only that, but the ability to safely share passwords between family members while also keeping all data in house was great for my dad who routinely unplugs our google home minis so they don't "spy on us".
  
What self-hosted applications or homelab functionality has persuaded the commoner in your life that your homelab is worth it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As there's not a dedicated Authentik sub, I though't i'd ask the learned folks in here to see if they have any advice.
 I'm trying to set MFA to only be required if not accessing from a specific subnet. So, I've created an expression policy containing the following:
 return ak_client_ip in ip_network('10.0.1.0/24') 
 Which is bound in the default-authentication-mfa-validation stage of the default-source-authentication flow. Negate result is ticked.
 However, when accessing Authentik from a client on the defined subnet, I still get prompted for MFA credentials.
 If I change the policy to:
 return ak_client_ip.is_private 
 Then, I don't get prompted for MFA. However, the point is I want MFA on some subnets and not on others.
 Anyone have any guidance?

The goal would be to avoid algorithms and provide me control over the things I consume. For example: I would like to add /r/selfhosted, youtube channels and maybe a twitter handle on the same timeline stream. A single entry point for my media consumption, where I control what I get. Features would include:
  
adding multiple different sources (twitter, reddit, youtube, filesystem, rss, etc)
 multiple timelines (news, tech, health)
 tagging items 
 sending items to third party services (send a twitter message, etc)
 multi-platform (web/android)
 I don't have to leave the app to consume the content (I can watch the youtube video, for example)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently, I've been putting an older 2U server together for a friend as their first starter homelab. It's on the old side, based on a Supermicro X8DT3-F with the same SAS onboard and one PCI for the extra ports, based on LSI SAS1068E (pre-2008, 3gbps). 
 I gave them 6 of the 10TB drives pulled from my own lab (upgraded from 10s to 14s on one of mine) 3 of which was an existing zfs raidz1, After booting up the system I found nothing wrong with importing the existing pool, until I went to add the 3 wiped disks to it. That was when I discovered the SAS controller had a 2.2TB limit to the drive size, even in IT mode. 
 I thought to myself "Self, you know ZFS does some fun stuff to make it function at a low level on the drives, which is why it won't work on a hardware RAID, maybe you shoud make those drives into a zpool and put them back in the system." So that is what I did, and to my surprise, the full 10TB was being addressed! I fully expected something to break fantastically when going over the 2.2TB point of any drives, so I loaded those bad boys up with as much random unedited video I could scrounge up, and filled all of them. Despite being rather slow, they survived a scrub and test play of several of the files.
 ​
 In the name of... Science (?) I figure anyone looking to get mega-old servers, or maybe those with some laying around, might find it interesting to turn practically useless hardware into backup servers of last resort, or like my friend, a somewhat slow starter lab. I would be especially interested to see if anyone successfully pulls this off to know I didn't somehow violate the laws of computing, common sense, and all that is holy. So... good luck!?

 Mirror RAID is absolutely mandatory for me so I am looking for a way to connect two harddrives (2x14TB).
 Is there a PCIe (or better, mSATA) to eSATA board I could use?

 In a normal setup, I would simply host a VPN gateway in Azure or something and have everyone connect. However, there will be devices like PlayStations and phones involved, so that's not an option. Connecting directly from the router to the VPN would solve the problem, but would also route all of their traffic over my gateway, which isn't great either.
 I also don't want to expose anything in my local network.
 I know, this is a rather esoteric use case, but maybe someone here has an idea.

 ​
 As the title states, I'm able to run a Guacamole instance of this all-in-one Docker image in a test laptop whereas I'm having no luck whatsoever with my home server.
 Both systems run Fedora Silverblue, with all that it entails. 
 My docker-compose.yml describes the service as follows:
 guacamole: image: docker.io/jwetzell/guacamole:latest container_name: guacamole volumes: - ${CONFIG_DIR}/guacamole:/config:Z ports: - "${GUACAMOLE_PORT}:8080" restart: unless-stopped # privileged: true 
 Any ideas? My only guess lies in the GPU side of things (the test laptop has an oldish Intel iGPU alongside and AMD dedicated GPU whereas the home server has a 12th gen Intel iGPU with no dedicated GPU whatsoever).
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, appreciate you time. I've got some supermicro servers that I want to put SATA SSDs into, but the drive bays are 3.5inch. Obvious solution is to use adapters, this brings me to my main question. My main question being:
 ​
 It doesn't seem that anyone sells just the little metal brackets that you screw the 2.5 inch drives into that you would then screw into a 3.5 inch drive bay without including the actual tray. If you've had to solve a similar issue, how did you solve it? Cheapest I've found the bays with brackets is at 8 dollars a piece
 ​
 It seems that the cheapest way of doing it is actually to buy a used drive tray's that come with the adapter bracket, this seems wasteful because I'll never use the drive bays since I already have some and it seems like it could be done cheaper since the bay itself is certainly the most expensive part of it. 
 ​
 I found a couple of adequate STLs but I don't have a printer so I'm not sure whether I could actually get brackets for cheaper than the price of whole bays.

 This is the closest I've gotten with a protocol error on netbox and nothing noteworthy (that I can tell) on the FreeIPA server (googling these messages isn't giving me anything useful lol)
 Netbox django ldap auth log:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not used to Reddit so apologies if this is the wrong place or I screw something up. 
 I have a very old hard drive (HGST Touro 1tb external drive from like ten years ago, it's been with me forever and the exterior is full of scratches from impacts that it honestly shouldn't have survived.) I use it purely to back up unimportant data since it could die any moment now.
 I'm transferring files from it onto a new drive after the previous one had to be RMA'd and I noticed something strange. When transferring one particular file, the transfer froze and so did crystaldiskinfo which I was using to monitor the new drive under load. The "read error rate" value kept decreasing (meaning the errors were going up). I figured the drive was finally dead or it was an issue with the specific sectors holding that file. Killed the transfer, started it again excluding that file. Everything started moving smoothly again. 
 However, what struck me as odd was that once I did that, the "read error rate" value reset to the default value of 100, as did the "worst" value. As if nothing had happened at all. I just checked it again and the transfer is still going, but the "read error rate" value was back down to 98, then reset itself when I refreshed crystaldiskinfo. No other utility shows an issue either. I know the drive's probably dead. but anyone have any clue why the value keeps resetting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, I'm in Brazil, so stuff which may be inexpensive elsewhere might be really inaccessible for me.
 My data is divided like this: 1.4 TB of movies and TV shows, mostly on 720p or 1080p, 375GB of copyrighted classes I ripped from places and a few GB of files that are less static than the other two sets.
 Backing up the movies and TV shows isn't really necessarily, as I could always grab them again, but I'd like to safely store what I ripped, as well as have versioned syncing for some of my user folders.
 Also, I'll visit my brother in the US by the end of the year, so I might take the opportunity to buy some hardware on black friday and set up a nice NAS to feed my Plex.
 For the backup and storage, I was wondering if I should go with Wasabi + some software (preferably with a GUI, but not strictly necessary).
 For the NAS, I believe that some setup with support for 2 HDDS, one with 4TB and one with 2TB, would meet my requirements for a very long time already. I'd be streaming mostly to my laptop, but also to smartphones and TVs from time to time, so it would be nice if it had transcoding capabilities.
 I tried reading through the wiki, but I simply felt overwhelmed by the information and decided I'd rather ask for an informed opinion, so any advice is very much appreciated!

 This afternoon after work, I threw in some memory cards I got second hand from eBay (2x 32gb DDR3 ECC 1600mhz). After researching how to I needed to install the RAM from the Dell handbook, I put the RAM in. I did it wrong a few times and it got stuck in POST loop so I held down the power button to power down. I finally got the memory stick configuration right and the server booted and appeared in my connected devices in my network. When I got to the ESXi web ui and logged in, I was missing both of my datastores. 
 more info: I looked at the drive bays and my second drive had a yellow and amber alternating light. I found the diagnostics in the manual, says it means "Predicted Drive Failure". 
 I don't know what to do or what to research, any advice?

 with the ethernet cable plugged into port 0 (Eth/Boot) I select: system / routerboard / settings and set the boot to SwOS. click apply and OK and the click on reboot.
 then i can't seem to access it anymore. i've tried enabling dhcp option after boot and still nothing.
 i've tried 192.168.88.1 and 192.168.88.2 as well.
 i saw this post with the same problem but it wasn't resolved.

 My issue is: I’m trying to find the most quiet, reliable drives for my NAS, but here’s what my research shows so far…
  
from every account I’ve followed, I should stay away from Ironwolf if noise is a concern, and I can attest to that because I tested 14tb Ironwolf Pros in the past and could hear them a full floor up.
 if I want Helium I need to go 12tb or higher (and I’ve heard 10tb WD Red Plus drives can be loud)
 I shouldn’t bother with 5400 class drives because they just run at 7200rpm anyway from what I’ve read.
  
Any accounts about how 10tb WD Red Plus sound? Or 8tb? Or just opinions on which drives to look at? Thanks.

 Would like to follow the Apache-2.0 license while modifying it and hosting it online, know that we need to "License and copyright notice, State changes". How do we achieve that in detail?
 Let's say a web app, its untouched font-end doesn't have “copyright” and “powered by”, should we add a copyright notice like "copyright the name(the project name/company name)" on the font-end on every page?
 For the back-end, I am also adding some code. For the untouched file, we just leave it as it was? Then for the new file, we can add our names as authors, correct?
 How can we achieve the State Changes requirements? Do we need to push our code to the github?
 Thank you.

 Is there a CRM tool that you can recommend that I can host on my own NAS/server? I'm getting burned out by all these SaaS tools that just bog me down with monthly fees, when I don't really use them very heavily.
 ​
 Right now I'm using Google Address book and trying to keep track of clients in there, but it feels a little clunky. I'd love something with a design that's more like a CRM tool, but without the fee's!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have been trying to do some research on having multiple domains to my home. One for more family personal stuff and another for more professional which would probably just be Nextcloud. I currently use traefik with one domain and one host. Everything I have googled either isn’t much of a guide or just wasn’t what I was hoping to find. I also searched using HaProxy on pfsense to balance between the servers and then traefik to handle the subdomains after that but only found one thing and it was to not do it. I also looked into cloudflare tunnels but seems like it’s not really ideal. I’m not doing anything media streaming with the domain so would that still be an option?
 Is this even possible? Where can I find a guide in order to set it up if it is? I just want to be able to have more specific domains than anything. Don’t want to mix a family domain with something a client may type in. And I’d rather not set up NC with a provider because I really don’t want to set up more security for that. 
 Thanks!
 Edit: wanted to add that I’d like to separate the domains over multiple hosts. So one host per domain and of course each service getting a subdomain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a few years of running a handful of services for personal use on a duct-tape-and-spit setup of systemctl services on a once-dead family PC (only accessible via ip:port, of course), I've finally decided to take the plunge and redo everything with fresh hardware, docker compose, an actual domain name with https, etc. I currently have (just about) everything that I think I want up and running on another computer brought back from the dead (an old gaming laptop with a shot GPU), but I'm hoping to buy some dedicated hardware to improve performance, potential for future services, and -- arguably most importantly -- a system that I can actually trust to last without draining my bank account via power bills. I'd ideally like to stay below $150-200, although if there's something not too far above that I can stretch it a bit. The current services that I have dockerized and running that I'd plan to run on the new hardware are the following:
  
Adguard Home (although I could be talked into switching to PiHole, AGH just seemed easier)
 Caddy + DuckDNS (reverse proxy and domain name registration)
 Flame (Dashboard)
 Nextcloud
 Jellyfin
 Sonarr, Radarr, and Prowlarr (might expand to other *arrs in the future, just haven't found the need yet)
 qBittorrent
 gluetun (to route some services through)
 Yacht (for managing containers, also open to suggestions for this one)
 Possibly a separate music library (maybe Navidrome? Currently running airsonic-advanced on the older server which works fine but an upgrade would be welcome)
 Possibly an image gallery separate from nextcloud (so far looking at Immich or PhotoPrism, but I'd like a way to auto-upload photos from my desktop too (possibly syncing with Nextcloud?), ideally with some level of face/object recognition, and the ability to organize things into folders myself would be nice (e.g. separate folders for photos I've taken and things saved from elsewhere))
  
Any suggestions/advice would be greatly appreciated!

 I can't make my mind between Ds 720+ or Asustor AS6602T. As I understand they are same class NAS?
 My idea is to use 2x Seagate Exos X16 16TB, mirrored. As I understand this Seagate drives aren't on compatibility lists. I wonder if they will run well? What restrictions can appear? 
 It will be used mainly as media server with 4k transcoding. I'm completly new to this game so any advice for what I can use NAS in home for. I'm not planning to add any RAM or SSD drivers, so please advice me how they will run with stock ram and two 16TB HDD.

 So, I was wondering if there are any compact, low power draw, Network Attached storage devices that can attach only one, 1-2 TB m.2 or 2.5" drive to my home network so I can more easily restore and transfer files to and from the 2 PCs.
 ​
 I do not want any expandability I only want a singular drive, small size and low power draw are my key factors here.

 I would've liked to put more choices in. Unfortunately, the poll function only allows a max of 6 options.
 I will use this section to track the amount of "Others" option:

 Long time follower of the sub, but first time poster.
 So I have been reading all about the different setups y'all have. So recently, I started to take the plunge myself and started to self-host a server.
 Now to do this I grabbed a bunch of HHD's I had lying around, but unfortunately they started to give me errors. And made working with them really difficult.
 So there lies my question: what software do you use to check your disk health (intensively) so that you know older disks will keep working for a while.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple months ago i hit the 95% mark on my current system and started planing my new Nas. Now i am at 99,83% and still couldnt decide on a solution that will hopefully last longer :/
 Pls tell me if my ideas/requirements are stupid.
 What i want to achieve:
 - 4u Case (Rack is basically full) - so extra JBODs currently not possible
 - ATX Mainboard & PSU support
 - Not super loud (or at least modable with noctua fans)
 - At least 35 bays 3.5" - 48 would be perfect
 - Top or sideload
 - 6g backplane
 - Max 1000€ just the case, full server no drives 3500€
 My ideas so far:
  
Getting a Chenbro 40700
 Would meet basically all my requirements the only problem is availability. I have been looking on ebay & co for the past 6 months and couldnt find any (EU). Besides like one listing for 4000€
 Supermicro Super Storage
 like the SSG-540P, 6049P & 5049P
 Would be quite a lot of compromises, loud non replaceable fans in psu, mostly no atx mb or psu and only available in intel configs not epyc. But still poor to none availability.
 Intertech Case
 Super cheap (like 150€ new), no backplane, no anti vibration, Rail quality poor to a point where i wouldnt trust it holding 40+ disks. Maybe usable when heavily modified but not sure
 Storinator
 I really looked into it but just way to expensive for the components. When compared with diy and you look at the hardware costs (cpu, ram, hba, psu etc) i ended up with like 8000€ just for the case on a 10000€ server
  
Am i asking for to much?
 What are your setups, ideas, tips.
 Would be really thankful for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
 First time poster but a long time lurker, I have been talking to a number of people about the state of documentation, manuals, tutorials etc. Some are amazing and really thought out, some are meh and others are just broken.
 I also find the entry to certain services to be out there for some people new to self hosting, so as someone with over decade of experience in infrastructure and has a love for doing things cheaply (it's actually harder to do it cheaper than buying a rack with $5,000 worth of kit haha) and a love for simplicity I decided to create the dummies guide to self hosting.
 Now don't think that's insulting. I love the dummies guides (check them out here) I have multiple of them myself and I love the style of them. Plain in language and simple to follow.
 Now the first one i've written assumes you have basic linux skills (creating files etc) but I am working on a docker & portainer guide soon along with a few others in the basics range.
 Today I'd like to launch with Matrix and Element.
 https://obexus.co.uk/dummies-guide/002-matrix/
 I welcome any feedback and also looking for contributors too who are interested as I am in writing really simple guides for anyone and everyone.
 My list so far being made (some are already in draft)
  
Authentik
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 *arr groups
 Portainer
 Hugo + Umami
 Actual
 Invidious
 Vaultwarden & Bitwarden
  
I am also planning to have some business focused ones so stay tuned for those.
 Thank you all for a great community, truly be enjoyable part of my day hearing new to the hobby making great things.

 Won't let me post the aliexpress link so check the pics.
  
So I need to add more storage and I'm out of internal ports/space, but my RAID card has 2x external SFF-8644 connectors. Was thinking of getting a couple of these (the SAS version with a SFF-8643 connector) and having them sit outside. I know, its made in China, unbranded so no support, but it seems like the backplane just connects the drive ports to the SAS connector, so no controller or anything that can die. Supports 12Gbs SAS, cheap, and I'll probably replace the fan with a noctua.
 Anyone ever tried these or have any experience with these?

 While doing so, I like to document my journey as a developer, so I compiled a few articles where I briefly talk about these self-hosted services.

 I plan to continue updating/adding more as and when I explore new services. If you have any specific ones that you absolutely love, then I would love to know about them as well, so feel free to drop a comment or reach out in DM. 😄

 PS: some of these are pretty good and famous so you might already be aware of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m searching for a simple self hosted web clipper. I’d like to have a single web page where I can paste a link and ideally both a single html file and a PDF (with the reader view of the page) is saved. 
 I want to create a saved archive of pages that I’d like to keep around for reading. I think it should be clear why I don’t want to keep the links: pages are shut down or old content changes all the time. 
 I know there’s Browser plug-ins that do this and iOS can do web archive. But I would like it to be consistent whether I’m using it from a phone or desktop (and ideally directly store it on the server). 
 Does such a thing exists? Or any non self hosted alternatives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several files that aren't needed in a daily basis (or even a yearly basis), and it seems a waste to not burn them into optical disks (even multiple times) or even external USB disks (HDDs or SSDs). I don't want to lose what I have stored in the extenrnal disks though, because I may end up re-downloading it. Additionally, I seem to have some files in multiple disks (for reasons), or similar files that I want to reorganize. It seems I have multiple VHDs taken from various systems, for example, all strewn in multiple external USB HDDs.
 In my ideal world, somebody will have made a special file system that would keep the list of the files (maybe with some minimal extra metadata, such as checksums, thumbnails, duration etc) offline, and when you do a modifying file operation (such as moving a file from one folder to the next), the UI for the file system would ask you to insert disk A to do the writes (or maybe insert disk A and disk B so that it can move the files from one disk to the next, or insert CD A to copy the files from it and mark them as deleted, etc.). Does such a program exist? Has anyone used anything like it.
 As a second best solution, I'd like something that you just register a disk (optical or HDD/SSD) and it records what it has on it and displays within its own UI (so no actual file system). I'm pretty sure something like that exists, but my searches have been fruitless - maybe I'm not describing this correctly.
 I figured if something like this exists, this subreddit is probably the best place to ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, I built a humble homelab and I got friends in low places, so we decided to set up a shared storage system to back up our files at each other's houses. What do you suggest? We are all CLI-savvy, so any stable FOSS is welcome.
 I looked at a few options:
  
Raw rsync with open firewall ports: not my favorite idea.
 Ceph: too complex for me to test on my own. Maybe there's a guide somewhere.
 Tahoe-LAFS: I spent months trying to get this to work on my own and I couldn't figure it out.
 Restic: 
  
We don't need any fancy "management" system tracking usage, and all files are encrypted before being sent, so physical security is not a concern.

 I am working on important film project for my career as a fresh and a new DIT on the market and I need your advice. I wouldn't be asking for a question here if programs like ShotPut Pro, Hedge, SilverStack or YoYotta are available to me ( production issues that are becoming my issues). To cut to the chase, technical director has offered me a program called Teracopy. I have never ever worked with with Teracopy, but I've been searching and learning about it and during that process, I've stumbled upon a few alternatives like: FastCopy, Robocopy, Kyno, Rsync, ChoEazyCopy, Roadkill Unstopable Copier, Goodsync, etc. etc.
 You get the point, so much information, so many different software, it's easy to get lost in so much information.
 Do you guys have any recommendations? Have you worked with any of those programs?
 Thank you all in advance,
 Marco.

 As you may remember from my previous posting here in this sub, I presented you Kubero: a selfhosted clone of Heroku to deploy your apps on your Kubernetes cluster. 
 Thank you for your support by staring my project ❤️ 
 I worked hard on it for the last 2 months: 
  
Released Application (v0.0.1)
 Published Operator (V0.0.70) on Operatorhub.io and Artifacthub.io 
 Added Docs (still growing)
 Deployment examples (buildpacks) with the most popular languages and frameworks (PHP, Ruby, Go, Javascript, Python, Rust ... ) 
 ...metric tons of testing and fixing
  
Kubero is still 100% nonprofit and open source. So contributions (coding or testing) and feature requests are very welcome
 I will start with the Kubero CLI (Golang) when the main Project has reached 100 ⭐ :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/selfhosted, I just wanted to gather some opinions regarding removing Nextcloud from my home server and replacing it with a few other services. The features I actually use from Nextcloud are just WebDAV access to my files (via Mountain Duck), and CalDAV/CardDAV sync to my phone and laptop.
 I've been considering replacing NC with the following services and would like some opinions on a few points:
 - SFTPGo as a file server: Mountain Duck can connect to SFTP servers, and on iOS the SFTP File Provider app can plug into the native Files app to browse my files. SFTPGo also has a WebDAV module which I can use to sync browser bookmarks with Floccus. My main question is, how do WebDAV and SFTP compare, performance-wise? I have had the feeling that WebDAV's transfer speed through Mountain Duck is a bit inconsistent, and it doesn't deal very well with large files, but I'm not sure whether SFTP will fare any better there.
 - Radicale for CalDAV/CardDAV. Not much more to say on this one.
 - Filebrowser or Filestash as a WebUI to browse my files if needed. On that note, is there an ARM64 Docker image of Filestash anywhere? The offical repo only provides AMD64. 
 The goal is to replace a big monolith of an app (Nextcloud), with a few more lightweight services and maybe reduce the load on my server. Does that make any sense or is that an overly elaborate solution that will not provide any real improvement?

 I'm planning to run a Nextcloud Docker instance on my server, but I have a bit of a dillema.
 Let's say I run Nextcloud on an SSD and have the database be stored on two HDDs configured with RAID 1. If I wanted to run say, Jellyfin, could I also put Jellyfin's database on those two HDDs? (Separate from Nextcloud's)
 Or am I fundamentally missing something? Please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure if I can post it here, but I am somewhat a data hoarder. I love making electronic devices teardowns and document how they work and what do they have inside.
 I am also developing an open source firmware for them, OpenBeken, so it of course helps.
 Anyway, here is my page with teardown links.
 It has just reached 100 devices - I do not brag without doing work first.
 Of course, many teardowns were submitted by OBK users and contributors, so it's a community effort.
 Our content is really unique - there is no other place dedicated to making a DETAILED teardowns of IoT devices.
 ​
 My question is.... do you like that kind of thing? Is there someone interested in just, maybe achieving our work or maybe even contributing to our IoT devices database list?
 The contribution procedure is simple. Make screenshots from shop, take photos of package, take photos of device insides (preferrably good quality), write down chip names, do a eletronic analysis if you can, do a firmware dump if you can (with UART tool ,not necessary), post it to our Elektroda forum (our reliable hosting, this forum has about 20 years history) and I will add your work to the list. Thanks.
 PS: I also do a teardowns of non-IoT devices, but that's a story for another time!

The Dockerfile and docker compose I used are below. I created symbolic links to the apps I am interested in into a single directory and mounted it to /docker/logs in the container. Thought I would share if someone else is looking for a lightweight solution to consolidate and view logs in a browser.
 Dockerfile
 FROM golang:1.16 WORKDIR /gotty COPY . /gotty RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 make FROM alpine:latest RUN apk update && \ apk upgrade && \ apk --no-cache add ca-certificates && \ apk add bash && \ apk add lnav WORKDIR /root COPY --from=0 /gotty/gotty /usr/bin/ CMD ["gotty", "-w", "-p", "6383", "lnav", "/docker/logs/*.txt"] EXPOSE 6383 
 docker compose
  gotty_lnav: hostname: gotty_lnav image: gotty:latest container_name: gotty_lnav restart: always volumes: - ${docker}:/docker ports: - '6383:6383' 
 Quick setup instructions
  
git clone https://github.com/sorenisanerd/gotty
 cd gotty
 nano Dockerfile, paste contents above, save, and exit
 docker built -t gotty:latest .
 Add the docker compose above to your docker compose file
 ls -s /path/to/app1.log /docker/logs/app1.txt (do for all apps you are interested in)
 docker compose up -d
 Launch browser and go to http://localhost:6383

But an entire iTunes backup to my server. I know that macs can sync with an iPhone over wifi and back them up without being connected via a cable. So I was wondering if there was a way where as soon as my phone connects to my home network, it triggers my Mac to backup my iPhone over the network and have it store the backup files on my server. Is then even possible? Is there a docker container that can emulate a networked Mac with iTunes for me? Sorry if this seems like a dumb question but I couldn’t find anything on google.

 You need to change the default smtp port value in config.js to 587, from 25 IIRC. 
 Save, then restart service. 
 Otherwise, as of now version 1.69.167 it wont work and throw error in the logs.
 In windows it's located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Eaton\IntelligentPowerProtector\configs or wherever you installed it.
 In linux (debian for me) : usr/local/eaton/IntelligentPowerProtector/configs/
 Then need to restart the service,
 windows : eaton intelligent power protector
 debian (as root) : sudo systemctl restart Eaton-IPP
 ​
 Thought i'd put it here as well in case I get stuck again someday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 The house I’m in has pre-ran coax cable in the walls to jacks in about every room, I’m wanting to using a device called a moca converter to turn these jacks into Ethernet out puts, effectively wiring my whole house for Ethernet connectivity.
 Anyone have experience with this? Things to look out for or suggestions?
 As it stands my ISP (Spectrum) will only allows for one modem inlet on one jack, so I am thinking I’ll then tap an Ethernet cable off a switch, run it to the attic where I’ll convert from Ethernet to coax. 
 I’ll then use a coax splitter to wire into the loose cables that go to the rest of the jacks in the house.
 At each one of these jacks I’ll place another moca to get back to Ethernet and do the deeds from there.
 Anyone poke some holes in my plan?

 PfSense - I can set up let's encrypt certificates on the firewall coming into my network.

 What's the best practice on setting up the SSL certificates and who should you take yours from when being offered them up by everyone? I forget which one I actually chose... I think Nginx since they let me do wildcards and that way I'd only need the one certificate... But was that the best choice?

 I know I have HSTS turned off on my Nextcloud/Nginx proxy manager but half the time when I connect via the fqdn from inside my LAN I'll get the HSTS error. A few minutes before or after and it'll seem to be working fine. If I connect from outside the LAN it's usually no issue.. 
 When setting up the new nextcloud server, I made a test certificate. Now the production server is no longer named test, so the certificate name doesn't match the certified server. How do I go about revoking a certificate in Nginx proxy manager to issue a new one with the correct name on it?
 Thanks

I have the 2.5" HDD because I changed my laptop and all my data was stored in this 2.5" HDD. So I took it out of the old laptop and bought a casing for it. The connection is USB 3.0.
 I tried to backup the 2.5" HDD to the Seagate external HDD with Kopia and it took more than 5 hours to backup 260GB of data. Is this considered normal speed for Kopia or any backup software for Windows?

However, living in a small apartment without basement or spare room, am I kidding myself to think that a quiet rack based homelab is possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this in r/sysadmin but was told to post here.
 I'm trying to set up OpenLDAP to mimic what is set up at work. Since I'm mirroring work, I can't use any alternatives like FreeIPA or others.
 At one point, I had an OpenLDAP server running in my homelab on a Raspberry Pi as I was trying to learn OpenLDAP setup and configuration. I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.
 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

 I've been looking for a proposal software for a startup i'm working on launching and I see all sorts of SAAS options but nothing active and self hosted. Anyone has a recommendation ?
 The only open source "options" I found seams dead like Bupros Procurement  and version 4 of invoice ninja but they removed the feature in v5.
 From what I understand the top SAAS are PandaDoc, Proposify and Prospero but I'd rather self host everything from open-source projects.
 Does anyone know of a procurement software open source project that's still running ?
 Edit: Found LibreSign since, ill try to install it and give feedback but I'm still open to suggestions.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a pretty specific, out-there request, so it's okay if no one has any idea on this sort of thing, but
 I'm looking for a self-hosted timer. Something where I can be like, "hey, in 32 hours, I should check on the thing". Preferably in the form of a docker server that can be checked from a browser? Though I guess I'd be interested to hear other alternatives even if they aren't that. Kinda like those "it's xx days until Christmas" deals, except that it doesnt have to be Christmas
 I know I can technically just download any standard ol' timer app, but
  
That's on a per-device system. If I ran the timer on my computer, I wouldn't be able to, say, check on the timers from my phone
 I'd have to keep it open. :( (first world problems, I know. admittedly, if I need to restart my computer for whatever reason, that does throw things out of wack)
  
Anyone have any ideas on what this might be?

 I mean proliant Gen1 - Athlon generation CPU.
 Was thinking of taking the tops off them, fitting a bit of clear perspex instead so you can see the internals and attaching a couple of legs to them to make "Steam punkish" type coffee tables.
 (Thought I might use scaffolding poles for the legs).
 Waste electronic folks want to charge me an unreasonable amount of money to take them away - figured I might as well do something interesting with them.
 Wondering if anyone has done something similar and if so would ya be up for sharing pictures to give me a bit of inspiration?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, this is sort of a side topic, but since folks here know a lot about storage… I recently got my NAS all setup. Now I have my main PC I want to do some stuff with. 
 My PC has RAID on-board, and my main drive is two SSDs running RAID0. They perform extremely well. 
 So, I now also have TWO WD 12TB drives which I want to setup. I had one in there but I removed it and now I decided to put them both in. My dilemma is: do I stripe them or mirror them. 
 They will be used for a few things: downloading all kinds of stuff that I will keep some of, and trash some of. I’ll also be running a few virtual machines as well, and those will go on there. 
 I really know the pros and cons for each option, which is all the more reason why I’m asking here, because I’m finding it hard to decide which I’ll be happier with in the long run. I’m inclined to go mirror just in case of a failure, but the overhead is heavy for what certainly is not mission critical stuff. 
 Anyway, what would y’all do?

 I bought 3 UPS from a homelabber (no idea if they are on here) several years ago.
 Replaced the batteries and all seemed well.
 A week ago the one I had under my home theatre (TV, Receiver, Xbox, etc) started randomly beeping when it had a load, but only occasionally.
 It still worked though so I just ignored it.
 Yesterday came home and my wife and daughter said they smelled burning plastic but couldn't locate source. I flipped on the TV and about 5 minutes later the UPS started popping and my shooting flames out the side.
 She went for the Fire Extinguisher and I just unplugged it from the wall and it stopped.
 So just a friendly reminder when your UPS complains, LISTEN. Can't imagine how bad this would have been if it decided to go sparky when we were not home.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this has been asked a million times but I'm having some trouble figuring out the best way to do this. I remember trying rlclone at some point but I remember having to get a new token pretty much every few hours. Plus the rclone documentation doesn't seem to cover whether the uploads will be browsable, or if they are just a backup that can be restored from, or something else. (I tried all this about a year ago, I was not able to use anything I uploaded.) My ubuntu server has about 10-12tb of data in a zpool. I only have about 10/mbit upload speed, so it seems like prioritizing important directories would be the way to go. 
 I would have no problem picking a few directories for an encrypted upload monthly or bi weekly, that I could restore from if something went haywire. It does not need to be browsable, but I do need some way of identifying directory names since they will be encrypted as well to my understanding.

The official Authentik integration documentation doesn't mention OMV, but I am sure something like LDAP should work just fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm attempting to backup my important rocky linux home server data with clouberry and backblaze b2, and I'm running into issues trying to give cloudberry root permissions so that it can read my entire filesystem. I'm new to this and can't help but feel like this is a novice issue, but I can't find any answers online. The cloudberry website itself addresses the issue by saying I should change the permissions on the files I want to backup, but this is my entire filesystem, I don't think that'll work without stepping on toes.
 ​
 My error (The amount of denied folders changes per run and gets much higher):
 "Dear [FirstName] [LastName],your backup plan BulkBackup COMPLETED WITH WARNINGS, please see below for more details. 
 ERROR
  
Access was denied to 103 files/folders (code: 1610)Access is denied to 103 local files/folders set for backup
  
INFORMATION
  
Files and folders were skipped: 81 (code: 1603)Skip folder: Count: 78 System and hidden files skipped: 3"
  
​
 What I've already tried:
 I've, of course, tried running the command as root "sudo cbb plan -r BulkBackup"
 I've also changed the to daemons that cloudberry uses (cloudberry-backup and cloudberry-backupWA) to use the root with the addition of this in their respective .service files:
 "[Service]
 User=root
 Group=root"
 and I've since restarted the server and all the daemons and that didn't work either.
 ​
 Thank you and sorry if this is easy and I'm just stupid!

 Or maybe create a video conference up to 50 people right in your browser. 
 I used proprietary software for that in the past, they were pretty good. But open-source sucked ~5-7 years ago. I'm wondering if open source is now more stable, and there are reliable platforms.

 I now want to access my home server from outside my home network and just got tailscale up and running and it works fine.
 My question is, is there any downsides to staying with this approach forever? I did a little bit of digging into how the other approach would work and got a little scared of the port forwarding stuff and if I would be exposing a vulnerability publicly. 
 What are the security differences between the two approaches? Am I right in thinking tailscale would be safer for me if I’m not too confident about network and security related things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking to by a dedicated router for my home network and I'm having trouble deciding between a pfsense home built router and a Mikrotik router. My question mostly concerns the Mikrotik. Right now I have a home server that serves a samba share for a few kodi boxes, but it also is setup to do reverse proxy with subdomains so I can access my photoprism and jellyfin programs from the internet. Basically instead of typing <ipaddress>:<port> i can type <sitename>.duckdns.org/photoprism Is this something I can accomplish with a Mikrotik router? Or would a dedicated pfsense pc be better? The only reason I haven't decided to go pfsense is because I really don't want a second pc running all day. I guess I could build a new home server that supports virtualization and just run pfsense and my other network apps that way so it would only be one pc running, but I don't really know what kinda hardware I would need to accomplish all that.

 Properly supports/passes through SMART 
  
Came across these two (Syba SY-ENC50104 and QNAP TR-004) and going by reviews they seem to fit the bill, but if just looking if anyone has anything else to recommend.

 Enviroment is Docker in Ubuntu 22.04. Docker is up to date as is Ubuntu.
 Today when I went to log in, i received an error instead. 
  
An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. 
  
I've checked where I could. one thing that's odd is the log file in my config directory hasn't been touched since yesterday.
 I do see the following in my docker logs for this container:
  
Listening on: http://172.30.0.2:3001/ ERROR getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND mealie-api at GetAddrInfoReqWrap.onlookup [as oncomplete] (node:dns:109:26)
  
This repeats several times.
 Now that i check the container logs for the api, I see that it is likely the issue. it shows as unhealthy and it's container logs are full of errors.
 https://pastebin.com/H6VXkR3X
 i've removed and recreated it but i still get these errors. 
 i'm aware that I'm probably missing some info needed to help so please just let me know what else i need to provide.

I don't want anything super fancy, just something that has around a 128gigs of ram and is able to run different decently heavy stuff without having a lot of trouble running. My budget is around $400 - $500 but is still flexible. 
 So to my main question what is a good starting point and like how can I decide on the things I need to buy?

 I already have an adapter to plug them in at the same time.
 Is it as simple as using macrium/clonezilla in a partition? 
 I was also thinking of using those programs to create a disc image file and perhaps loading it onto vmware? I haven't tried that before.
 Will update as time progresses.
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, coming for advice. A while back I had a Ryzen 5950x more or less fall into my lap, so I decided to put a machine around it. It's on an X chipset with 64GB DDR4 and has 2x 1TB PCIe 3x4 M.2 drives. Elsewhere in the case are 6 3.5" spinners and the whole thing runs on unraid. I'm using it for two things right now: a Plex server (along with the rr's) and Minecraft server which is outward facing via reverse proxy.
 Perhaps you'd disagree, but this seems akin to a sledgehammer driving brad nails into trim wood. Given the above use case, what machine specs would you all build to? Should I just slam a GPU into this machine for use as a gaming rig, and build something new for the PLEX/Minecraft rig?
 All thoughts welcome - cheers!

 Popped in my system and was presented with a password request from the drive before entering windows. After hitting enter a few times, it says "disk locked". I got into windows where I found I couldn't initialize the drive. I tried a dos promt diskpart and it fails with an I/O error.
 After hours researching self encryption and other such stuff I'm still stuck with a useless slab of spinning rust. Seller is willing to help me but made it clear if it does not read in his synology NAS he's not going to refund me. I'm worried that because I guessed password wrong 3 times.
 Things tried:Seagate toolkit (does not see the drive)
 PSID as password: does not work.
 Swapping cables
 Updates: Apparently this is a ST12000NM001G model which is not self encrypting according to https://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/enterprise-hdd-fam/exos-x-16/en-us/docs/100845789f.pdf Is this good or bad for me? I'm more confused now than ever.Also he tells me the drive is shucked and he no longer has the enclosure - no warranty I guess

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I always have problems upgrading nextcloud. Something breaks and I either have to rollback or spend hours fixing it. 2 days ago I spent like 4 hours doing manual upgrades from cli because the web updater kept giving errors and wouldnt get out of maintenance mode. Then after like 5 upgrades in, I kept getting a different error about my db not being connected even though it was running and listening so I just ended up rolling back to before I started doing upgrades. Great waste of time. 
 I dont care for all the apps. I dont need a cms. Im the only one who uses the instance so a chat feature doesnt do too much for me.
 The only functionality I care about is cloud storage for my photos and videos and privileged account access. I like how theres an android app. I like how the android app has auto upload. I like having a web UI. I like having a trash can in case I want to restore something I deleted. 
 The last ~4 days I've been having issues with the android app crashing and I tried to upgrade my NC since Im on V22 but got all kinds of errors and had to rollback. 
 The other day I downloaded a different app called fireshare. I love the UI there and I love how snappy and responsive and quick it is. I uploaded an 80mb video to it while I was testign it out and the video buffered instantly. No stuttering. The same video on NC would play for 10 seconds then pause and buffer and the whole app will freeze up when I try to click play. 
 If someone took whatever engine is running that and repurposed it for cloud photo and video storage + android auto syncing then it would be perfect.
 I see a lot of people complain about nextcloud on this subreddit all the time. Im surprised someone hasnt made anything yet to replace it knowing a competitor would be well received around here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My data server has a 7*4TB MD RAID 6 array, which I'm perfectly content with, and I have no plans to change. It's 90% static files, and those that do change, I'm not concerned with snapshots too much
 However, for backing up, I've previously just rsynced to a bunch of USB drives, which is not practical, so I'm setting up a new solution. At the moment, I have still got USB drives, grouped into one big LVM, on a VM server, with a 20TB LVM-thin drive pointed at a backups VM. Little complicated, but will be very easy to expand (though I am fully aware that one dead drive will kill the backup and I will need to start again - I'll have a 3-2-1 in place soon too though)
 Anyway, looking at the backup solutions on here, there's loads of options, such as Borg and rdiff, as well as simply rsync, but I am aware that ZFS has two very useful features (I'm not well versed in ZFS though sadly!):
  
Snapshots, in case I completely bork something and don't notice until 3 backups later
 
Deduplication. I have a "staging" area for ripped Blu-ray content, and sometimes it's too much effort to rename them straight away, and it's likely they'll get caught in a backup and duplicated, which could waste lots of backup storage
 
 If I'm right, ZFS should be a solid file system choice for the backups server. My concern though is I could dedicate about 8GB of RAM to it, which is well below the suggestions I hear
 Failing all this, I guess I'll just try one of the mentioned softwares

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a rant here, but it feels so great to have people genuinely use your server outside of testing. It’s one thing to have friends access and stream for a quick test, and then another to have them genuinely use the services and recommend them to others. Makes all the work worth it imo, and it helps me learn the best ways to streamline the experience.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically, I'm trying to download all the posts by a specific artist, however, he got over 3k posts on his media tab, including lots of memes and image reply, in any case, I tested 2 different applications for it.
 Scrawler works, but, like the Dev himself told me, it is limited by Twitter's own structure, so it can only download the images from the last 1000 posts. 
 The other program I used was Twitter Media Downloader on Chrome, it worked kind well, despite some limitations in the ammount of images it can download. However, I noticed something. 
 It straight up refuses to download the posts from a specific time frame, November and December 2020, giving the message "No applicable tweets found" Other dates in the year can be downloaded without a problem, but not those 2 months. Is there any way to solve it, or recomment alternatives?

What I expect from the storage (I plan to buy 1tb storage, when I have around 250gb at best to store, with possibility to grow) is to "lay in the corner" with data backup possibly for years and be sure that it won't die out of nowhere. It would be used let's say once in a month to do a back up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some more context: I have an external USB hard drive connected to my home server (an old laptop). On most days, the drive is only active for short bursts (either media consumption or nightly borg backups). I assume this kind of usage pattern is very common in the community.
 I've noticed that the drive never spins down by default and makes quite a bit of noise, which prompted me to look into hard drive spin down with utilities such as hdparm (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/hdparm). In my case, I changed the APM (Advanced Power Management) setting from its default value of 128 to 64 which reliably spins the drive down shortly after the burst of activity (as verified by ear and smartctl -i -n standby /dev/sdX). Great – less noise, heat, and (hopefully) power consumption! Now my question is the following:
 Do you let your idle hard drives spin down? Does spin down actually increase the longevity of the drive (with a similar usage pattern)?
 I'd be super happy to hear what other self-hosters do and if you could point me to a reliable resource for further reading. Thanks a lot in advance!
 Edit: the drive in question is a consumer WD Elements Portable (https://www.westerndigital.com/products/portable-drives/wd-elements-portable-usb-3-0-hdd#WDBU6Y0050BBK-WESN)

 I'm in the process of recreating my home server because I ran out of space. I'm taking the chance to move from my 8 disk RAID 5 array of 8TB drives to a 10 disk ZFS-Based RAIDz2 setup
 I've been planning to use 16TB drives for my new array, but then happened to catch a sale on WD 18 TB drives - so now I've got two of those. So my main array will be using 16 TB from each of those, and ignoring the left over space
 Is it possible to set up a second RAIDz1 array with the left over 2tb of each (or RAIDz2 if I can find an extra 2TB drive somewhere)? Or do I really just lose it?
 Thanks!

 I need SSL certs dumped into a directory, home assistant can take it from there. DNS challenge should be a piece of cake with DuckDNS. But all docker images I'm finding use nginx and require open ports I have no interest in opening (and it's kind of a PITA due to my network setup, which I don't intend to change any time soon), recommend installing stuff from random people, etc.
 I have started looking at acme.sh and there is a lot of outdated and incomplete information.
 Is this really how it is? Did I miss a trivial setup somewhere?

 What would you do with the r310? Does keeping esxi 5.5 limit me to what OS VMs can be installed? I did have windows server 2012 on it but decided to try to virtual 2019 on proxmox Instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently become interested in creating an offline/online family tree. I know we have a gencom file for each side of the family, but I want to make it more collaborative.
 What is the best way to create a collaborative master family tree with gencom AND media like photos/videos/audio?
  
I don’t want to use a geneology online service where our data is discoverable by others and not owned by us. Another consideration is exporting and backing up the data and especially media from a site like that. We can use those sites mainly just for research purposes.
 
I was thinking about using GitHub for the gencom file since it is simple text data, not public if you don’t want, users can have specific edit permissions, merges have to be reviewed before publishing, and there is versioning history, and backs up offline
 
But gencom allows for storing links to media content. What is the safest and most cost-effective way to archive all of this data for offline and also allow users to add new sources (not remove existing ones)? I assume cloud storage with an automatic local backup, but that’s a lotttt of files….
 
 I’m sure there is already good info for the media storage question on this subreddit, but I’m not sure if there are any special considerations for genealogy. My first thought was databasing it all but I don’t want to deviate from an established standard. Please share any info that might help, thanks!

 Currently I have an old CPU HDD as a local backup drive and a new SanDisk Extreme V2 SSD I'm using as the primary drive. I'd like to make a third copy of this data to put into a safe deposit box or someplace similar.
 Would it be best to have a different brand SSD for the offsite drive? Or would it be best to buy a similar Sandisk Extreme V2 SSD?
 I wanted the offsite to be a fast SSD so updates would be quick. The Samsung T7 Touch was my first thought an offsite SSD backup drive. Appreciate advice from expert hoarders.

 Currently have a very old QNAP NAS that's not able to host Plex, Jellyfin, Emby or any other media 'server' application.
 It's literally an SMB share.
 Aside from Kodi, what other options does one have for a nice Plex like media player interface that is available on Android?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, so I initially had used ARQ, but annoyingly and quickly basically spent $50 for nothing because on windows, it had various annoying issues but primarily, it would completely fill the destination drive to capacity, and stop working, regardless of what I tried, and their support was not able to provide any meaningful amount of help. 
 So, I recently upgraded the drive in my backup box, and figured maybe it's time to give it another shot since duplicati, while pretty nice, feels quite slow, has had some odd database issues that need a rebuild, and is also awful for going through to actually restore files from. 
 I'll only be backing up to an SFTP box since cloud storage would be too pricy for how much data I have, and I don't worry too much about versioning, though with ARQ doing real time scanning, instead of being a twice per day or whatever you like duplicati schedule, I might use it occasionally. The main use is an "oh shit" something went horribly wrong backup. 
 So, I was wondering, before I delete my backup and give it a spin, has it matured more on windows? How does it compare, or maybe there's something even better than both. Crashplan was still amazing and then got killed very soon after I used it sadly, and ARQ was the closest because of the real time scanning, but yeah, not working because it couldn't properly respect the destination size limits was a no go.

My main gripe is every time I need to upload my changes to my server it becomes a hassle. I feel there should be a much easier way to do this, especially if I need to update multiple times a day.
 My current routine:
  
Do edits on local machine, test everything on localhost
 Compile static content into hugo/public folder (hugo -D)
 Create a tar.gz of hugo/public folder (public.tar.gz)
 scp the file to my server home directory
 Extract the public.tar.gz into my static webserver directory (/opt/webserver/html)
 Redeploy my static webserver docker container
  
Is there an easier way for me to accomplish this or can I automate some of these task to be more efficient?

 As discussed in our previous post, we have a roadmap laid out for the work taking place on our project as we have received funding and now have received stage 2 of funding. In this post, we will continue discussing our progress to date.
 Back-end
 Mawthuq Software Roadmap
  
With the back-end we are making OK progress. We are a bit behind due to lack of time lately but we should be able to pick up the pace
 We are currently on working on creating API paths for each major route, most are done and partially tested to be found working.
 API paths are on postman but currently do not have in depth documentation
  
Front-end

The front-end has been design has been completed
 Next steps are developing the front-end into components
  
Naming
 With regards to naming the specific suite of project we were thinking of SafeGuard. What do you guys think of this name?

 Ive tried DigiKam, but for some reason no matter what I do it will always crash upon finding duplicates for me, which is a dealbreaker. 
 Some optional, nice to have features would be: facial recognition and or some kind of AI "meme recognition", autosort by metadata, text recognition and copy/paste (cursive supported maybe?).

Basically I have unraid running for most of my services, and love it. But I recently bought a lenovo m700 with an i3 and want to use it for a backup server as a while ago I lost everything due to wrong power cables. I just have no idea what OS to use. I've been thinking of just using unraid again, but I'd rather learn something new. That, plus the fact that any drives I plug into it will have to be external, I'm not sure where to go. Another option I was considering is casa os (I'm not that comfortable with cli and prefer gui).
 Also, what software is best for auto backing up selected shares from unraid to the lenovo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BACKGROUND: I have a paid G-Drive account of 2TB I also have about 70-100GB of videos (and growing). 40-50% of the videos are personal recorded zoom calls or something of that nature. The other 50-60% is a plethora of videos I downloaded from YouTube (using a 3rd party app) and other websites.
 The content of the videos range from fan-made music videos of popular songs, specific movie scenes and dialogue, episodes of certain TV shows, etc. Pretty much anything that I found to be of personal value to myself.
 SITUATION: I want to create shareable embedded links of the videos to paste them inside my Notion page(s), to have a place where I can quickly watch and refer to them when needed. I do not wish to upload these videos directly onto Notion.
 Problem is, that half of my video collection is technically copyrighted material. Having that inside my G-Drive and sharing it with an embedded sharelink, could have my account flagged and banned. 
 I do have a Synology NAS DS218+ which I recently purchased and have implemented G-Sync with. But I am still learning the ins and out of operating a personal NAS. And don't want to experiment with creating links to and from my NAS like that.

When GMail still allowed 3rd party apps, I would be able to use Python scripts to authenticate and email myself files as attachments, but I can’t do that anymore.
 Also, after a 2 year headache of working with serverless Dropbox, I’m done with that. It worked, when it worked, but it was always locking up and constantly needed my attention.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at the Dell PowerEdge R350 with a Pentium CPU (for low power usage). However I'm unable to configure it on Dell's site with 8 2.5in drive bays when using the Pentium CPU; it limits me to 4 3.5in bays.
 Does anyone know if I'm able to swap out the 3.5in bays for 2.5in bays? This is my first rackmount server, so I'm not sure if there's some chassis restriction that I'll run into when attempting to swap them. Alternatively, does anyone happen to know if this restriction is something I could circumvent by going through a sales rep instead of the Dell website?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit,
 I have the following setup of servers: Dell PowerEdge R710 (six 3.5” bays)
 Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays) Dell PowerEdge R620 (four 2.5” bays)
 I have the following hard drives: 12x3TB 3.5” drives 8x300GB 2.5” drives 8x600GB 2.5” drives
 I have the 8x300gb in the R620 servers. Since there are six 3.5” bays in the R710, I can put six of the 3TB 3.5” drives there. One problem is that it has the PERC 6/I, which only supports up to 2TB. It also fails to start up at boot 90% of the time, so I want to replace it.
 That leaves me with 6x3TB and 8x600GB.
 I’ve spent some time on eBay, and I’ve found the following: 2xMX827 - This gives me 16 slots (8 per card) so I can have future expansion. These are 2.5” though, so I need another for the 3.5 drives.
 I also found 1xW814D, which is the same board I have in the R710 right now. I can buy another one and connect 6 more drives.
 That means that I will need more SAS controllers. I do not need RAID or whatever. I need to pass them through to Proxmox VE so I can do ZFS.
 The problem is that there is only one backplane power connector per server. My questions are the following:
  
How would I connect more backplanes to power per server?
 
What SAS controller can I use in PCIe that can handle these backplanes (preferably cheap, I’m a student)?
 
What are the part numbers for the cables that I need to connect the backplane to the SAS controller?
 
 Any help is extremely appreciated. Thank you in advance.

 Ordered 64 gigs of ram to double my total. I have a supermicro motherboard that can hold up to over 200 gigs of registered ECC ram, so I should be good. Searched for the part number on ebay and all was well.
 I have found that the computer hangs on system initializing when all the 8 sticks of ram are installed. Each set of 4 sticks boots up fine, it's just when all 8 are together. I also added a second CPU, but that seems to not effect both sets working or not.
 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/QwGkcf/samsung-memory-m393b2g70db0yk0
 https://www.ebay.com/itm/134129405674
 Anyone see a difference between these two sets of ram?

 Per the subject, how bit accurate are Usenet downloads I know sometimes there's a HASH available for comparison, and PAR2 to fill in missing blocks, but when you download the file, especially if it's in parts, how bit accurate is it compared to a torrent. Which in theory, the client verifies is bit accurate during the download and upon completion.

My modem does have 2 Ethernet ports. I’ve got 2 identical HP 1810-24G J9803A 24-port switches that they retired at work. I’ve got a Netgear AC1750 Model R6400 and can get another one for about $70. I know that I might need to tune the channels so the Wi-Fi isn’t conflicting. And I’ve almost got my DL380p gen8 built and configured like I want, I could build an identical dl380p for about $500. This is all so fascinating to me.

I have two good 80AH external batteries that was connected to it instead of the original internal batteries. It is a good way to repurpose an old unit with dead batteries and have done this many times.
 The thing is that I don't seem to get hold of another UPS in the 1500VA range so my thinking is to buy a new unit but since I have good batteries I would like to buy a UPS for use with external batteries. I have been up and down the internet but cannot find such a UPS, the ones I have found are way too big and also expensive.

 I have a new AP WAX630E https://www.netgear.com/business/wifi/access-points/wax630e/
 Its has a 2.5G uplink to pFsense which is great and I currently have 3 vlan's trunked to the AP.
 VLAN 1 (Default) for management and trusted devices
 - IPv4 & IPv6 work great, DHCP & RA are provided by my Netgear 6100
 -- Speed test to open speed test server on local lan gives me 1.7Gpbs if I get really close to the AP
 VLAN 10 & VLAN 11 for IoT & Guest network
 - IPv4 works (as per default vlan) great but IPv6 is pretty much broken
 -- All clients in VLAN 10 & 11 get RA & DNS just fine
 -- Internet connectivity & dns is working fine but TCP traffic is limited to around 50-60 Mbps
 --- I took a wireshark capture on my laptop and notice that IPv6 packets have a lot of TCP re-transmissions in these VLANS which I suspect is killing the performance
 ​

 Firewall rules havent been tuned yet for these vlans and allow any to any is configured, so this is not the issue, and no bandwidth control is configured (as you can see in IPv6 speedtest).
 So now I'm at a loss as what to troubleshoot next?
 I'm thinking the acceleration could be broken for IPv6 in the Netgear access point when traffic is coming from and to any of the non default vlans.
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated as what I should be looking for to solve this issue :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I wonder if there is a product that can be plugged to a PC with USB3 and provides multiple SATA data ports (at least 4) ? 
 The drives would be powered by something else.
 I don't need RAID, i don't expect nor will i use maximum performance.
 I am not looking for a dock or enclosure. 
 Just a plain old cable/expansion USB3 to 4x SATA data ports. USB2 would be acceptable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow hoarders. I need help and don't know where else I can ask this anymore except for reddit. Sorry if it's long I try to be as detailed as possible in case someone here spots something fishy.
 I have a 1 year old Western Digital 12TB Elements Desktop Hard Drive that I use to back up all my critical data. Had a planned backup for a 400GB file today and plugged the hard drive in. I copied and transferred the folder over and left to let it so its thing. 
 However I came back 10mins later to an error message. "Error 0x800701b1. An unexpected error is keeping you from copying this file...." For some reason my wireless mouse had failed at the same time, and my PC had hanged/lagged? I almost had to force shut down my PC. Eventually got my mouse and PC running again and tried to eject my HDD but found that in the period my PC was hanging, my hard drive had ejected itself.
 I eventually plugged in again. And then transferred the folder into the drive in chunks.
 1) Has anyone here seen anything like this before? What happened here? What should I do :(
 2) Have I lost data from my original 400gb file due to an interrupted transfer+ an improper ejection of my drive?

I'm not in the field, I've just always hosted my own stuff and it's grown over the years large chassis allowed for bigger coolers and quieter fans. used to be in a 24u rack up stairs before battery purchase/ full home hardwire now its downstairs I probably have louder systems but why buy new cases when I'm underutilizing the systems now.
 My NVR runs around 55-60% usage. The main server varies based on plex/game hosted 75-80% max

 Would appreciate any recommendations on pc case that is shallow and not too dissimilar to depth of routers/switches. Only plan for motherboard/psu/2xssd inside.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newbie here. 
 I'm looking for something that I can fill with hard drives, and connect to my server via cabling that doesn't require a full cpu/mobo to run. I would rather have a modern solution rather than buy an old NetApp or other from ebay - but I'm not sure what to buy or what cabling/extra card(s) I would need to connect it to my server. 
 Any suggestions would be amazing, thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I know this gets asked a lot and I've done a search which overwhelming seems to point to Moodle as the LMS of choice in the self hosted community.
 I am looking for an LMS for home use for my wife and I. Could swear I remember seeing a post within the last 6 months with recommendations other than Moodle but maybe I was dreaming as I can't find it anymore.
 So, Moodle doesn't seem to list some actual features that I am interested in (okay well it does but not all of them, or maybe it's assumed I already know). I already have Plex btw, and I really don't want to use that for online learning course material.
 The features I am looking for, in something kind of light weight are:
 - Multi user support
 - Video support (I have videos on a NAS, if I serve up an NFS directory, can I sort those videos on the LMS into the correct courses - like Plex, let me make a library)
 - File upload for course materials and PDFs etc - if PDF could be rendered in browser that'd be pretty sweet
 - But not only video streaming in a browser, but also audio stream too
 - Course completion meter and tracking (like, I've done 50% of the course etc)
 - Course tagging
 Thanks everyone! :)

 My initial approach was to wrap a folder in a Veracrypt container and have it mounted while I’m using it, then periodically back up the container in an S3 bucket. But this is a single device solution, anyone got a better idea using NAS or a file server? It can be a linux only solution.

 For context I have about 21 containers with Traefik setup as my reverse proxy. It's configured to setup Lets Encrypt certs automatically when I create a new service, and seems to work quite well thus far.
 I also have a static public IP address, so don't need to worry about DDNS or CGNAT or anything like that.
 Just not sure if swapping to using tunnels is worth the hassle of reconfiguring how my environment is currently set up.

 I assume that if I was to share it I would get a d.c.m.a. strike on it.i wouldn't share on youtube for example.i would be more likely to share with a small group of family friends with small children. Any feedback is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks,
 My WAF is at it's record lowes't right now, I've been working with a "temporary" setup for over 8 moths now just because i can't get myself to finish properly attaching my rack, and that is mostly because i made a mistake when choosing where to place my conduit; please bear in mind this is a cinder block location so any changes are very troublesome.
 A while ago we remodeled a small room in our home, which is kind of the man cave: it has a small shop and the "internet" side of my homelab; however, i decided it was a good idea to place a small rack the highest posible place, right above a sink, i tought "i'll just set it up and wire it up neatly, put it there, set it and forget it", however, It's been proven very difficult to finish this task (it's worth mentioning this is not my main homelab, this is just an omada setup, two ISP modems a UPS and some RPIs, so it's not something i'll be thinkering with a lot).
 The problem that i have is... it's very difficult to work or wire anything when the rack is hitting the ceiling, and on that setup i can only access the front and right side of the rack, so that is very hard.
 Can someone help me choose a better path forward? I'm thinking that i can either:
 - Overcomplicate this setup even more, putting the rack into an "arm" so I can lower the rack when i need to work on it
 - Change from a rack setup to a "wall control" (kind of like the one technotim has) on the same location
 I much rather not change the location of the setup, since I don't have much space and all of the connections are already in that spot.
 I hope that what i wrote made sense, thanks for letting me pick your brain

 I just installed a used x540-t2 10gbe NIC and its just stuck on a boot loop. won't even let me into the bios. just turns on the fans, waits a sec or two and then turns off, and just does this forever till i pull the power. 
 ​
 I've disabled the onboard NIC in the bios, and disabled booting from the network (don't remember what gigabyte calls that) but still doing it... tried it in all the pcie slots, no dice. boots just fine the second I pull it out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been experimenting with several media server programs (Jellyfish, Komga, etc) on an Arch Linux PC using Docker. Previously, I have only accessed these programs through my PC. How can I allow other computers to access these media servers by connecting to my PC via Wifi?
 The setup I want is that my Arch Linux PC connects to the home network/Internet through ethernet. However, I can spin up docker containers for media server programs on my PC. Then other computers can access those programs by connecting directly to my PC (peer-to-peer might be the proper term?) via Wifi. I don't want to simply make the media servers on my PC accessible to my entire home network.
 It seems like this should be possible, but I'm not sure where to start. I would appreciate some advice. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Currently in the process of trying to turn my simplistic homelab into something that can run multiple services, punching holes to the outside world as needed. Traditionally, ive always just directly opened the hardware up individually, but I'd like to replace that with a more modern, virtualized solution.
 Given a single machine or two, how would you:
  
Manage VMs
 Configure reverse proxying to VMs and/or other physical hosts
 Handle network traffic (eg. possibly replace a router/switch, vlans, etc)
 Auto-provision SSL certificates
 Expose portions of that network for public use under a personal domain via subdomains
  
Thanks!

For what my homelab does, it doesn't feel worth it anymore especially since I don't tinker much these days - no longer really learning, just maintaining. Everytime I think about shrinking it, I get stuck on the notion I need that TrueNAS NAS/SAN server (#1 below) since I run multiple hypervisors. I also get stuck on the fact I prefer to avoid downtime for Plex and Blue Iris when maintenance and/or troubleshooting is needed on homelab equipment.
 Based on my setup below, any recommendations on how to re-design my homelab for lower power consumption and consolidation without giving up my aforementioned preferences (or am I stuck with this current setup and power consumption)??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got my own domain name.
 A while ago I read a post where someone had used their own domain to use a separate email address for every service they signed up to online. So if they signed up to reddit they would use the email address reddit@mydomain.com. Then if they started getting spam to this address they would know that it was reddit who sold their data to someone else, as that's the only entity who ever knew about that address.
 I really like that idea.
 Does anyone here have any experience to set up something like the above? I'm not necessarily sure I want to selfhost this. I'm open to all options right now, but I would like an email server (either selfhosted or not) with the following features.
  
All emails sent to any.address@mydomain.com can be aggregated into the same inbox.
 I can block a specific address if necessary. So if some service sold my email address to some spammers I can simply forward all of those to the trash.
 I don't want to set up a new email every time I sign up to a new service. I want the default behavior to be that all emails sent to my domain goes to the same inbox. But this default can be overridden when necessary.
  
It's possible that this is a really bad idea for some reason I haven't thought about, but I'm happy to take any and all input and ideas.

 I'm looking for suggestions for a card with a single port that's fairly low power and can use the PCIe 3.0 speeds. 
 OR perhaps another HBA330 is the way to go? (and then I can port 4 lanes out the back to an external box at a later date) 
 OR would it be better to add some SAS expanders to the current HBA card?

 I have a nginx as a reverse proxy for all the docker containers I want to expose to the world. It is also configured to require authentication certificate from the device that tries to connect. 
 Now, everything is hunky-dory with windows and linux (and I suppose android, haven't tested it yet, but afaik shouldn't give me any grief), but how does one present the a client authentication certificate from iOS / iPad OS in Safari/Chrome/Firefox and ideally all the other applications that may require it (for example nextcloud, jellyfin) in the future. 
 I imported the root CA crt, trusted it, then imported the signed pem file with all private key+certificate+CA info (which is trusted, because CA which signed it is trusted) But browser does not ask for one when opening the website. It just says 403 Forbidden - which means that the auth certificate was not offered for the website.
 Any help is welcome, thank you in advance!

 I got a super nice heavy duty Sun Microsystems StorEdge 72" tall rack for free.
 I'd love to use it but it has threaded holes. I have been looking for a way to convert this rack to square hole. I'm also trying to figure out how many U I would end up with if I converted it.
 I can do light metalworking so it's not a big deal if I have to weld/cut/drill/modify to make something work. The trick of course is finding the right pieces to work with. Punching square holes in steel is not so easy. 
 Any ideas? I tried searching for some generic vertical rack rails but I guess my search terms are no good because all I am finding are generic server rack rails, not the actual square hole rack pieces.

Hopefully someone here could point me to the right direction.
 The NAS is accessible from other VM in Proxmox, but not directly from the Proxmox host. When I try to add the CFS storage from NAS to Proxmox VE, it does not show up there. Here is a diagram I made, hope it helps explain my problem. Thanks in advance.

 In a previous thread, I asked some general questions about planning datacenters in long-term. Some of the tasks that I currently have in my queue:
  
Install Confluence (either Windows Server or Linux > Docker)
 Setup LibreNMS VM (vSphere 6.5 => 6.7)
 Move from EaseUS EBC to Veeam for backups
  
In this thread, I will be diving more into specifics about my current project, and other areas where I can improve. As stated last time, the current project is based on a ProLiant DL580 G7 in a rack. The next version of the project will be based on a Gen9.
 In the project's current state, all VMs (that manage their own large files and backups) have direct access to their own mass storage via RDM (Raw Device Mapping). The original decision was made in this t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After years of waiting, i happened to check the kimsufi page and managed to snag a KS1.. Once configured it turned out to have a 2tb drive which was a nice suprise..
 So far, i've gotten Proxmox running and with some shenanigans i've got Proxmox Backup Server running as an LXC with half the disc allocated..
 I've finally figured out how to get my cloudflare domain pointing to it using OVH's reverse DNS settings..
 I've also got it running as a Netmaker egress node..
 I'm wondering what other people are using these things for?
 I already have my netmaker server running in a Digital Ocean droplet which i feel is a good fit, so not looking to move that..
 I do also have a Racknerd VPS running docker and uptime Kuma.. this was a BF deal and so is paid up for another 11 months so there's little point moving that..
 The speed is obviously slow.. 100Mb/s so i'm not sure what else to run on it that would also take advantage of the rest of the space..
 Any suggestions welcome!
 Edit : Maybe I should drop the DO droplet and move my netmaker server to that, and move uptime to my Kimsufi... the only reason i like DO for netmaker is that i can snapshot it every day to have a roll back point should i break it.. If i can find another way to back that up reliably then that could save me $7 a month..
 Edit : ok.. scupper that plan atleast initially.. i can't ping anything on my netmaker mesh from an lxc... hmm

I have my switch and router on the front of the rack, and I’m not sure how to manage the cables moving from the front of the rack to the back. I’m curious what people are using for cable management along the longer axis of their rack (it seems most cable management parts are geared toward the front 19” axis). I’d love to do something more elegant than zip tying the cables to the frame, but if it comes to that, so be it.
 Also, I managed to get a R720xd, and I’m looking at 3.5” drives. If I’m gonna raid the drives, should I shell out for WD Red or comparable hardware? Or can I get away with less expensive equipment since it’ll be a raid?

 ​
 they sent back a replacement just fine, not retail box or anything, but came with the enclosed drive and all the cables etc. the only thing is this newly replaced drive is definitely worse performance than the one its replacing. its 5400rpm, vs the 7200rpm drive that died, and im pretty sure this new drive is 256mb of cache, whereas the old one was 512mb. its also running an older firmware etc.
 ​
 sucks to get a worse drive as a replacement, and im not sure what (if any) recourse can be taken to change it. just thought it was worth mentioning here since i havent seen this particular RMA result/process posted before, at least from my searches. I am also not entirely sure this will even have any effect on my server given the harware acceleration, dual cache drives and other rando specs of the system.
 ​
 maybe i can use this in place of one of my two parity drives? since i think the lower performance wont matter as much for the parity drives right? and i can add one of the faster parity drives to the main array
 ​
 in case anyone wants to see some of the specs of the drive i got as a return

 I want to be sure they mount in the proper order because the number assigned in windows is there number of location inside my case.
 The question is: Should I plug them all into the LSI card and just fire up windows? I am thinking it will be best to plug them in one at a time with a reboot in between each one. 
 Thoughts?

 I have slightly ignored the updates due to issues with version 7.0.3 i believe.
 this seems to be the latest version : https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/192269258900635648/1033101193196609537/unknown.png?width=1440&height=490
 However i seem to have alot of i think security updates etc (see attached) there seems to be about 100 more varying from , vcsa updates such as version 70u3d.
 is there a way i can test these are safe ? or a easy way of checking ? such as a website that maybe vmware host or is it just a case of take a back up hit go and hope for the best?
 ​
 Any idea how long any of this will take ? i have a Dell R720 x1 xeon 2650 v2 (8 cores 2.4ghz) 48 gb of ram i can put more into vcsa if needs be currently it has 12 and ssd's.

 I picked up a R730xd (shoutout to /u/pandakidd81 on that) that is likely going to be a Proxmox host. I'd like to shove a graphics card in there for Plex passthrough for transcoding. I saw a few threads from a few months ago and wanted to see what some of my fellow Homelabbers have done lately with graphics cards and a R730xd, and if they did anything, if they needed extra parts, cables, what have you.
 The same goes for the other listed servers. I have that metal (two R510s, two R710s, a R320) sitting around; I'd be fine with putting a graphics card in any of those as well and just making one of those a dedicated Plex host instead. I could pick up another card like a single slot; I have a RTX 1070 (as well as a RTX 1060) around somewhere that I'd be willing to dedicate to the Plex server.
 Please share your success (and failure!) stories so I can make an informed decision. Thank you.

Problem is, the specs aren't the best and if I don't get a RAM upgrade a VM for every service isn't gonna be an option. I want to isolate them as much as possible for security purposes though. I also want the experience of setting everything up by myself, not just download a Docker image and install it, as I think that's the most fun part. What should I do? I'm currently running a proxmox and my vyos router VM on it and I thought about adding qbittorrent and nextcloud, although I will probably hit my 8GB RAM limit soon. So, what should I do?

 I'm not really sure what to do with the stuff on the hard drives. I don't want to share it since that would be illegal. I don't have time to watch all these movies.... hence, Icould just delete everything and sell the hard drives. Or I could start scraping something for good? Do you guys have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running qbittorent using docker. I want to port forward my torrent listening port to make me connectable to other peers. When I port forward the port, I do get connectable (as per the connection status symbol).
 But now my other port forwarding rules, 80 and 443 which my reverse proxy uses are having connection issues. Often when trying to remotely access my services using port 443, I get time out issues and connection is not possible. This will always start working again just as I remove the qbittorent port forward rule in my router settings.
 Seems I can only have one of these services' ports open at the time, and never at the same time. Both services are on same device, and on the same docker network. My router port forwarding rules point to my server and the correct IP. No other service is using the torrent listening port. Any tips?
 If anyone stumbles upon this later. The fix was to disable the "dos protection" feature on my Asus router. I think the amount of udp requests created from making my torrents connectable triggered the alert on a possible dos attack. Lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was poking around on Supermicro's website and was pretty surprised to learn they make switches. Specifically this one caught my eye: SSE-G3748-SONIC. It's marketed as an OOB Management Switch - i.e. the thing you plug all the BMCs in your rack into. It's a 48 port switch with 6x 25 gig capable SFP28/SFP+ ports. Obviously there are plenty of 48 port access switches out there with 2-4 SFP+, but I haven't seen many compatible with 25 gig SFP28 (and with 6 of them!) It's only 14" deep and lists a max power draw of 150W with optics, so I assume it's probably not toooo ungodly hot and loud. And the support for the open source SONiC operating system is intriguing - that's a platform I have no experience with but tend to associate with serious wattage data center switches (strictly speaking I gu…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, after reading a ton on here and living through a decade of my Drobo. It's time to sunset my 5D (I had a 4D before that). It's flaky and i can't even see it on my Drobo dashboard anymore. Luckily, I can still see the fie, but I know I'm on borrowed time.
 I've been actively considering a Sinology NAS or an OWC DAS answer. Since I'm likely to from from CrashPlan/Code42 to Backblaze, I need a DAS solution. Crashplan is like Drobo for my cloud backup. I'm so mad. 
 Can someone sanity check my logic/ thinking:
 I think I've settled. I'm going to get an OWC T-bday 4 with 24TB total. That should get me 18TB of storage which should last 2-4 years at least. At that point, i'll probably buy another 4bay (or get an 8 bay and effective run two 4's inside. My photo archive is' a little under 12TB today and that' most of what will be on there
 It comes configured with Raid 5, but OWC rep said RAID 4 was better for media. I'm not sure there's a big difference and I'm inclined to keep it "as it comes". 
 FWIW - I work locally and only use the external for storage and re-accessing photos over time. So performance isn't a huge issue on the volume itself. I just need to to be reliable and store my stuff with some reduncy.
 It sounds like the soft-RAID they provide will also work well. The downside is that I'll go down to single disk redundancy. My Drobo currently allows two drives to fail before i'm screwed. However, Drobo itself is a failure, so I'm not sure that's much solace. 
 Any reactions or caveats? I'm probably going to order it today if not.
 Essentially: * TBay 4 - 24TB model with enterprise drives * SoftRaid - keep as delivered with RAID 5 * Live my life.
 Am I missing anything big?

 As an example a message shows the time as 3:00 when it was actually 6:00 when the conversation took place.
 It feels like theres something up with the timezone difference between me and the way they send the data from their servers, but idk if theres a way to tick a box that says "download data with local timezone" or smthing
 Maybe its super niche but has anyone had this come up?

 I've doubts only regarding hardware for now. I plan on running Plex, rocket chat - for people in my home to communicate, backup photos/videos, deploy 1-2 backends for my custom home application with probably postgresql as a DB, there would be max 4 people connected and also something like pi-hole to block ads.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an older Synology DS215j (slow!) as well as a couple year old NUC. I'd like to implement a self-hosted photo solution to facilitate easy photo storage/viewing. I am not skilled in linux but have seen some of the pi-based solutions that look pretty straightforward (Photoprism for pi, etc) and I did explore Plex photos briefly. That said, since I have a NUC is there any way I can put it to use instead of buying another piece of equipment? Thanks!

 I've done 0 testing with these disks as I have just ordered replacements and pulled and resilvered the new disks and stuck the old ones in a drawer.
 I'd like to give these disks away to someone, but I want to make sure that any corrupted sectors are marked as bad and the disks are otherwise in a "known good configuration". What is the best way to do this? Should I just use windows chkdsk /scan /offlinescanandfix ? or is there any other process I should perform?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why are lifespans exaggerated backwards?
 Also, the usbs were untouched for like 10+ years. Similar time frames with other stuff too. No bit rot/corruption in any of the mentioned storages. 
 So yeah, I'm a bit confused. Those usbs and the hdd are probably over 20 years old. They have tons of pictures/videos and my mums uni assignments. We found another usb dated back at around 2009 and it also worked fine? That was 13 years ago?? 
 Also, the usbs should be on the same caliber as ssds right? (Flash) I've experienced first hand that an ssd will die out if unused for a year or so. (External storage for xbox)
 By the way, I plugged in the ide hdd through an adapter since the original iqon pc had it's power supply fail like 6 years ago. 
 The old phones (blackberry/some samsung, both 13-17 years old), still worked and I immediately backed everything up. Same with our old disposable cameras. All untouched for 10+ years.
 I didn't switch my xbox 360/wii/ps vita/ds for around 6-15 years, they all work fine?
 What's going on? This is old technology too, no ssd's.
 Is it like the old era being "built to last" (think of a giant stove/refrigerator) or were we lucky? 
 Also, are modern hdds better in it's lifespan?

I remember not long ago seeing a project here that had an easy setup to tunnel traffic coming to a VPS (or another remote server) to your home server without exposing ports, just like Cloudflare tunnels. I searched for it for a couple of hours, but I can't seem to find it, I'm sure I'm using the wrong keywords.
 Anyway, if someone can help me find it again, I'd really appreciate!

 Right now we use excel spreadsheets per employe with monthly tables and daily entries(begin, end, breaktime and monthly sum(calculated)).
 What i'm, looking for is a web based software with worktime tracking, overtime tracking and vacation management where everybody can track their working hours on a daily basis(not project based).
 Does somebody know a tool for that? It would also be nice if it was free and could be hosted on shared hosting (php)
 ​
 --------------------
 Edit:
 Right now i'm using this excel timesheet which i created a couple of years ago.

 My need is for example to be able to set that certain emails (they come from a certain sender or contain certain words in the subject, etc.) can then be managed, such as deleted or moved to other folders.
 Everything should work with IMAP. At the moment I am already using the filters feature included on gmail with which I can immediately delete certain unwanted emails or assign a tag to others, my missing need would be above all the ability to delete certain emails after a certain period of time automatically.
 All this to maintain order in my private mailbox and as a bonus for having to postpone the purchase of additional space as much as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I am running an old Asus AC68U router for a 2300sqft home. I have ethernet runs to most rooms. And I also have a 70' ethernet run from the main house to a detached garage. The asus is old, I'm guessing it was purchased in 2015/2016. 
 My wireless speeds are actually not bad. 30-60 on the 2.4ghz and 300+ on the 5ghz. The biggest problem is the detached garage, speeds out there are poor off of the netgear AP. 
 I have a WAC104 Netgear AP in the detached building and I seem to have trouble with it. My detached garage is the most annoying problem. I have some smart devices out there and I want to be able to control them over LAN from inside the house. But when that AP acts up, they show offline. 
 ​
 I'm debating if its worth the money to convert to an omada setup (Router, AP for detached garage, AP for house, and controller). Sounds like Omada would make managing the inside and outside AP's super simple. And if I ever wanted to add an outdoor AP (we may add a pool down the road) I could easily do so. 
 ​
 All thoughts and suggestions are appreciated. ISP recently upgraded us from DSL to Fiber. So I went from 6/.5mbps to 500/500!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Proxmox cluster of 3 HP Pro Compaq 6300 i7 SFFs is getting a bit long in the tooth and I've been looking around at some replacement options. I've been narrowing in on a couple of routes and was wondering if any of y'all could help with some questions I have in my quest.
 Option 1: Dell Optiplex SFFs
 Has anyone here gotten an Optiplex 5055 to run with ECC ram? I'd even be okay if it didn't support the ECC functionality, but just functioned. 
 Option 2: Build Supermicro based systems
 The drawback seems to be finding cases. Getting first party from Supermicro breaks the budget. The half height cases I've found on Amazon/ebay/NewEgg all seem like they are from the Bush Administration, and 2u case from iStar or Rosewill nowadays costs more than I paid for my 4U Rosewill NAS 6 years ago. I'd appreciate a case recommendation if anyone has one.

 Above is the first entry on each NAS of hundreds, groups of three a few minutes apart, each group hours apart, same on all three within a minute of same time. Nothing else has happened, Pen testing shows no external vulnerabilities, but it does eat away at my sanity. Nothing obvious is jumping out at me to reveal more details. I don't see any changes to network hardware around the start time, but since then both the switch and router have changed. 
 Any ideas?

 In deciding whether to use Synology Hybrid Raid (SHR) or regular RAID 5 or 6 is there anything to be aware of in relation to this sort of set up? For example, I think I read somewhere that it's not a good idea to use SHR when using the NAS as an iSCSI target (I can't find this reference again so I could be mis-remembering).
 I'm not convinced that I need what SHR provides but if there aren't issues with it I may as well use it.
 Hoping there is someone who has a similar setup who can shed some light. I posted on the Synology forums but didn't get any useful feedback.
 Thanks in advance

 I’m stepping by to ask if the UH-series from TP-Link is a good match for handling external hard drives? - it’s a USB hub.
 To put things in context: I’m a music producer. I want to extend my USB ports to something that can handle 2 HDDs and several MIDI-controllers, and maybe charging phones from time to time.
 Hope to get some good answers, either reviews of the UH-series or other recommendations for USB hubs that can handle my criteria’s.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm looking to get started in a CCTV setup for my home, probably using Frigate NVR or Zoneminder. I've had a look around for a few things needed to get started (below). About $1100 for a single camera setup to get it all going for now.
 What are you recommendations here? I'm not sure 4MP cameras will be enough, i've seen some 12MP cameras around which seem pretty good. I'll keep this network completely separate from my main network, only having the interface accessible via a VLAN and no internet access (eventually doing cloud backups at some point).
 I'd rather go down the self-hosted route rather than using a pre-packaged suite.

 I’m coming from a max after like 15 years I am switching to PC so I don’t really understand what is available for me .. what I want is like a “Time Machine “ but that backups not always in case my data gets corrupted I have enough time to see it before my backup drives copies the errors .
 I have movies .. photos and music that I DONT want to loose and I know that hard drive failures HAPPEN. Or maybe a company can store my files in the cloud on cloud storage for cheap? Please advice me . As I said I am a newbie in this topic of windows/ Plex backups … https://i.imgur.com/JPRMTX0.jpg

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my tentative file structure for the master backup I want to start for me and my family. I've lost too many pictures/docs to dead phones and hard drives. I want to do this right. My use case is that whenever pictures are taken on our phones, including my parents and girlfriend, it gets added to the NAS I have running in my closet. The backup will grow, but not delete anything from the NAS or cloud. But pictures on the phone can be deleted to save phone space.
 Currently, it's just a Windows plex server but it has 5tb of usable drive space. I've been hearing that Docker is the new way to do things, it would separate all the different self hosted programs I run. 
 I'm trying to decide between Nextcloud and Seafile. Every so often, I need to be able to upload a backup to a cloud like backblaze, plus an external drive that lives in a safe. I have spare externals I could rotate out, and my parents have a fire safe. What backup program would be best here?
 Any advice??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Intel has decided that ECC Memory Support is only allowed on Server Hardware, needing CPU, Chipset and Motherboard support. Given 'old' hardware is now stuff like Haswell are 10 years old now, supporting up to 32GB of DDR3-1866 Memory and even support M.2
 This hardware is more than capable of being used as a NAS. But most Boards & CPU's don't support ECC, so I'm wondering why we can't use software to mitigate a lack of ECC memory? Obviously there would be a performance hit, but when we are dealing with computers as powerful as these modern systems are, that decrease in performance is likely not significant (at least for most uses).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/ For Videos about hosting/managing stuff on Linux servers
 ​
 I am a professional who works with Linux servers on a daily basis and "hosting" different applications is the core of my job. My job is called "Site Reliability Engineering", some folks call it "DevOps". 
 Two years ago, during lockdown, I started making "DevOps From Scratch" videos to help beginners get into the field of DevOps. At that time, I was interviewing lots of candidates and many of them lacked fundamentals due to most of them focusing on these new technologies like "Cloud", "kubernetes" etc., so I was mostly focusing on those fundamentals with these videos, and how everything fits together. 
 I realize that this will be helpful to at least some new folks around here. If you are an absolute beginner, of course I would recommend you watch from the beginning, but feel free to look around and find something you are interested in. I have many videos dealing with basics of Linux, managing domains, SSL, Nginx reverse proxy, WordPress etc to name a few.
 Here is the landing page : https://esc.sh/projects/devops-from-scratch/
 Direct link to the Youtube Playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxYCgfC5WpnsAg5LddfjlidAHJNqRUN14
 ​
 Please note that I did not make this to make any money and I have no prior experience making youtube videos or talking to a public channel, and English is not my native language. So, please excuse the quality of the initial videos (I believe I improved a bit in the later videos though :) ) 
 Note: If you see any ads in the video, I did not enable it, it's probably YouTube forcing it on the videos, I encourage you to use an adblocker to watch these videos.

 ​
 I would like to connect the nas to my three windows pcs (to the file explorer) and to my iphone. I want to be able to access it outside my home network too.
 This is the first time ever that I'm building a Nas or something similar. I'm also not really familliar with linux yet. What will be the best OS for me? And do you have some reccomendations for hardware upgrades?
 Edit: I'd also like it to be (preferred) free or if it is really much better, under €15.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I find myself managing a dozen low resource vps servers in which I run a pyton script inside a screen and 2 docker containers each.
 The problem is that I often find myself having to stop/start a docker container or manually change/restart the script in the screen, and doing it for every machine (or part of them) is a pain.
 In my head i imagined a panel that would allow me to select multiple vps from a list and launch commands via SSH which would be saved via some sort of custom buttons, it would also be nice to be able to see the output of the commands in the various vps.
 There is probably no such thing, but it doesn't hurt to try :)
 Also i'm open to better suggestions, however the restart/replacement of containers and scripts is dictated by "needs from above" so it cannot be delegated to anything 100% automatic

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a curiosity question only. I am retired and have an almost zero need to be able to access my HomeLab outside of my apartment. In such a case, intra-network speeds play a part in the HomeLab experience. How much speed is too little?
 Background: I live in an apartment with a Wi-Fi only environment. I do not have Ethernet lines existent other than lines I choose to run within the apartment. Part of the environment Wi-Fi is WPA2-enterprise and I have absolutely no control whatsoever over the characteristics. I have a 31 dBm signal drop between the WAP and my back bedroom where my HomeLab resides. Currently, I connect to the WAP (wifi5, max 40MHz bandwidth channels) using a GL-iNet AX1800 FLINT (wifi6, configured as a repeater to Ethernet). I have two AV2000 PowerLine adapters which connect back to my HomeLab through the wiring in the apartment (this is a trunk line between two managed switches; the line is very noisy and I have experienced a max of 350Mbps (over a 7 foot distance); down from ~935Mbps using long Ethernet cables only - iperf, measured using two RPi 4Bs on either end). The current speed of this one line is 80Mbps down/64Mbps up. All other Ethernet cables in my HomeLab connected to active devices are at 1Gbps, except two RPi 2Bs which deliver 100Mbps. I mostly use my HomeLab for RPi experiments in conjunction with a VM/LXC Proxmox server.
 So just for grins and snickers, do you think a single line at 80Mbps/64Mbps is intolerable, or adequate? What do you consider a minimum speed for intra-HomeLab connections?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm living at my parents house and started to build a small homelab to test stuff (got a power-efficient mini-pc and currently work my way to a nas).
 I got a small corner in the basement under the stairs next to the "entry point" of our internet. This is where I put the mini-pc and want to put the nas. The problem is that my main pc is on the third floor.
 Back in the day when the house got built my dad only installed cat5(e?) utp that uses all 4 pairs (so he says and by my research this exists) to transmit 100Mbit down to the basement. While it works, I don't want to connect my nas to 100Mbit and would like to somehow get this to 1Gbit.
 The cables are built into the concrete and can't be removed and my dad doesn't want to spend any time/money on that because "we only have 50mbit download, so 100mbit is good enough".
 I know that there are RJ45 Y Splitter that use two 100Mbit 2pair cables to basically make 1Gbit. Is there any chance to make this work with 2 100Mbit 4 pair? I could probably use the Ethernet port in the room next to me, which would mean that the runs are probably not next to each other.
 Thanks for any help

I'd like it to be something like a "permanent backup": I write the data once, put it on a shelf and then read multiple times later without the ability to accidentally overwrite the data.
 Are there any common storage devices that offer such functionality? The only ones I know of are write-once CD and DVD drives, CD-R, DVD-R and possibly their +R variants. Are there any other options?
 I could use write-protection features of various file systems and simply store stuff on a hard drive, but it seems like there's no way to prevent formatting the drive and flashing a new empty file system. However, I'd like to have a storage medium that physically can't be formatted or overwritten after the initial write. Is there anything like this that's fairly common and not too exotic?

Nginx, apache, mariadb, dovecot, postfix, proftpd, servers (win/linux), you know — all. Right now it’s a bit everywhere.
 I’ve thought a lot about it, and I think I want to run Samba AD at the center, with federation to Authentik. That should, I think, give maximum options to connect users, servers and services. Except for usernames, and maybe this is an oversight on my part.
 Since I want my users to login with them@theirdomain.tld, shouldn’t that also be their userPrincipalName? Or can I just use the email-field? Or would that require me to spin up a Samba for each domain and have a forest? Ideally, each domain with its users would just be in an OU each.
 Once that is done, I can hook up all services, either via LDAP, Oauth2, or whatever is supported by each service.
 How do other big and small hosts out there do?

Can not this be done with this command?

 I installed the MergerFS plug-in for OpenMediavault (my server's operating system), selected all my drives (except the system drive and the backup drive) and let it do it's thing.
 In no time, I got a single volume mounted with all my previous data! That is... awesome! No need to search all the drives to find a single file anymore!
 Questions:
  
Say I buy new drives. Can I just add them to the virtual disk? Or will I have to recreate it from scratch?
 Say I remove a disk, or one of them fails. Will that corrupt all my files, like RAID does? If not, what happens, and what can I do in this situation?
 Will that meaningfully increase resource consumption or Disk I/O?

 Straight away i want to say that i know about SnipeIT but it just not first the bill of what i am after
 I am looking for Self-Hosted system which will allow me to track inventory using BOM (Build Of Materials). 
 System that will allow me to create item and mark BOM for these items. For example : 1 BOX contains 6 bottles, that means when i issue that BOX out, system will automatically deduct 6 bottles OUT as BOM material. 
 As another example, let's tay LEGO set of 10 pieces. All these pieces are BOM items which makes 1 SET. Change that 1 SET stock from + or - i would like that system know if SET is full (all BOM items are in stock)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Y'all. I've never doone RAID arrays, proper backups, or the like before and was looing for some advice. I've currently got a couple 4TB drives in RAID1 on OpenMediaVault, but it's filling up fast. After some research, I was planning on making an offsite NAS for redundancy.
 I figured a RAID6 of like 16TB each Seagate Exos drives would be okay for offsite redundancy, it has two drives that can fail, and can hold a lot of data on a smaller number of drives (was going to start with four, and possibly go to as many as six, depending on my usage. Since it's offsite, I wanted it to be as low-maintenance as possible)
 I was then going to set up my home NAS in a raid 5 of some smaller size also on OMV (6TB a drive, for example.) I figure it's less safe, but will still have a drive failure supported, as well as faster reads for the same amount of storage as compared to a larger drive.
 With the offsite redundancy, I'm not sure if that would count as a backup, or if I should have a tertiary option somewhere. I've only ever done cold storage for single disk backups, I'm not sure how that would work with say 25+TB of data.
 Is my proposed implementation stable? Are there any things I've overengineered, or should do differently within the limitations of only having 8 bays in my local system? I don't plan on filling them all at once, I figured the 3 drives minimum for a raid 5 and 4 minimum of a raid six should hold me over for maybe a year, unless it's better to create the max size array at once, to cut down on syncing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've acquired a Synology NAS which is leaps and bounds better than the Seagate Personal Cloud I've had for a while, especially so because the thing is actually supported (unlike the Seagate).
 In my attempts to move the data across, I have both the Seagate and Synology on the network, and on my computer I can see each of them as a network drive in the file explorer. I've essentially highlighted all the folders on the Seagate and copy/pasted them over to the Synology through the network folders, but what I've now realised is this is taking the data from the Seagate and sending it through my computer, which then passes it to the Synology - not exactly the most efficient way of doing things and is taking its sweet time.
 I don't suppose there's a way to do this in a more direct manner, through the interfaces of each NAS instead so that they can just talk to one another directly on the network rather than using the computer as an intermediary? I did have a look around, but couldn't find a solution. I also don't have the option to connect them to each other via USB as the Seagate does not support this.
 Thanks in advance.

 Recently, I tried to deploy another PiHole instance in the K8s cluster, and I got it (mostly) working, but external IPv6 could not be resolved from within the PiHole container.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking at the SMART data I can't seem to decide which pair of HD to replace. The pool is permanently connected as NAS in a network and it's only used when torrenting and/or playing films. So I don't know what's the best strategy to balance long term hardware and money (by maybe selling HD). SMART summary: * 1 HD without raw read errors relatively new. * 4 HD without raw read errors but maybe getting old. * 1 HD with raw read errors but SMART still OK. Self-test passed without errors too. Same age than previous 4.
 I have freshly new 2x10TB and I don't know which pair of HD to choose to replace in the pool. * Replace the pair where the HD with errors is or leave it until it dies if it does? Sell the other one second hand? Sell both in eBay with the SMART warning? * Replace 2 normal ones and sell them? Keep error one? * Maybe replace 2 normal ones, replace the error one when it breaks in the future and sell only 1?
 Help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am assuming that mechanical HDDs are simply impossible due to the operating environment, and I'm limited to SSDs. Obviously it won't be that hot most of the time, but if my vehicle is getting direct sun exposure all day in the summer, I can't have things crash. My Pepwave routers (formerly ubr lte, now br2 max pro) handle the conditions fine.
 So then the game is about finding the cheapest SSDs. Ruling out the stuff the stuff that's obviously fraud, the best deal seems to be 2.5" NVME U.2 drives, with several 7.68 tb models in the $400 range.
 From what I can tell, u.2 and m.2 are electronically compatible, and you "simply" need the appropriate cabling / adapters to go between the two. So rather than run some massive (and power hungry) server which natively runs u.2 drives, I can put the drives in dumb enclosures, get some U2 to M2 adapters, and connect them to something like the QNAP m.2 "nasbook" with the adapters.
 This would get me 32TB of SSD storage right around $2000, with a device that I can power directly off my DC electrical system. Am I missing anything? Is there a better / cheaper way to accomplish this?
 No, I don't care about performance - not in any meaningful sense. As long as I can get 100 megabytes per second I'll be fine - no plans for anything faster than gbe. It's all about reliability in a hot moving vehicle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys; I don't know much about syncing / storage solutions, pretty beginner here and after searching on the web i'm a little confused. I use apple devices (macbook air, m1 mini, iphone ) for work and i want to get rid of icloud as it always end up syncing all my files to the limit on my macbook so it's barely usable. And i'm tired of combining Gdrive and icloud for over 30$ a month, which will probably become even more expansive the more projects i work on in the long term. I am looking for cheaper alternatives. I just stumbled across syncthing, and looks great but i want to validate what i need.
 Basically; i need to be able to:
  
Access all my files from 3 ios / mac os devices.
 If i modify a file; have the modification sync everywhere quite fast for working on the go.
 If i rename/move a file; have it renamed everywhere fast and not corrupt/create duplicates.
 Being able to put a sync limit, or only sync specific folders. For example if my mac 1 TB is full; not try and clog all my storage space on macbook air 256GB like icloud does. 
 \*Bonus Have backup or previous save states for files.*
 \*Bonus Ability to share folders / files with clients directly.*
 \*Bonus Custom themes/branding options for some folders. Although i could use Notion or a similar app for that.*
  
What apps / technical requirements/knowledge do you recommand to get such system running? Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got two identical Seagate Barracuda ST1000DM003-1ER162 internal hard drives. They were bought together, and now I'm worried that they're going to die together as well. I took a look at the SMART info today and it got me concerned. I have backups of everything on both of them and my OS is installed on an SSD so I wouldn't lose any data if they did die, but of course I want to extend their life as much as possible. Hard drives don't grow on trees. 
 The drives are pretty old, the temperatures are okay and I do not have older SMART data to compare and see if the number of uncorrect/able and pending sectors is increasing or not. Here's the SMART info for both of them:
 Disk 1
 Disk 2
 There was also a bunch of errors:
 Errors
 I am also very concerned about all the "prefailure warning" flags NOT on the attributes marked as problematic. 
 But oddly, with all this wrong, I still get the following message:
  
=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION === 
 SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
  
So, my questions to you fine people are: 
  
I know there's a big margin of error, but how long should I expect these drives to last? 
 Why does SMART say "passed" with all those errors? 
 What immediate action would you take in my shoes? I'd like to avoid replacing them but if the risk is too big, that's what I'll have to do.
  
Please and thank you for your time.

 At this point, I'm suspecting it's a system board failure but I'm really hoping it isn't.
 Tried swapping power cables, PSU, Power Plug, Fans, RAM and CPU to no avail.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so, i was thinking of hosting a webserver just as a hobby but that would reveal my ip. should i conceal it? how? using vpn? can i use those free vpns since besides ip address other things are ment to be seen? (free vpns are usually not recommended but thats when talking about personal vpn for you when you search for stuff not for hosting). and can i do the same for gaming server or that would have too much latency? oh and for something like ipfs i would set up something like linode node?
 or i dont really have to care? i just felt like i should cuz when i searched my geolocation using my ip address it was accurate enough to tell my zipcode and the location it guessed was pretty close
 edit: do you think pure vps might be a better option for a website?
 edit2: also srsly, should i even care if others know my ip?

a synology single bay NAS
 
a hard working little raspberry pi with an SSD for speed running Plex, pihole, grafana/Prometheus, octoprint, and the TPLink Omada controller. 
 
vnopn micro running OpenWRT as the internet firewall/gateway. I have AT&T 2 Gbps fiber, and pfsense and opnsense would for some reason really throttle things. 
 
TP-Link 2.5GbE PoE Omada switch as the backbone to everything including 2 EAP 660HD access points. I replaced the stock fans with noctuas so it doesn’t wake up the cockroaches in the garage. 
 
 There’s also a UPS! 
 I dropped cables without a patch panel and just terminated and plugged them into a switch, so people on Reddit can note and tell me about this transgression. 
 Happy to answer any questions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, Im damned near at my wits end here. Regularly, my internet speed drops to dial up speeds. Think a few days a week. In the past week I have had 2 days where I was able to watch youtube, download things without issue. Just now I unplugged the supplied modem/router thing and the inline poe injector. Speeds jumped from .04mbs down to 25mbs down. The more speed tests I have done the more the speed has dropped and In the time I have wrote this post I am back down to 6mbs or so. Is there anything I can do, hardware wise to fix this issue before I start losing hair. Switching isps is not possible. The one I use is the only one to offer a unlimited plan in my area. Thanks for reading.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a server that has ssh, http and https facing the web, serving as a sftp NAS+web server. I've fended off a fair share of ssh brute force attempts, but what's nagging me is actually the web side. There is a single connection that's just constantly there, nethogs describes the connection as <server ip>:443-<some ip>:<some port> so it must be someone connected to or attempting to connect to my web server, yet looking both at /var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log doesn't give any info. The connection bandwidth is tx: 0.2~0.4KB/s, rx:1~3KB/s (both sometimes spikes to 5)
 It's seemingly not attempting neither a login nor a resource load. It's not logged in yet it's not failing any attempts. The destination IP seems to be different day by day, and sometimes it's established on port 80 instead of 443. What could this be? Surely certbot doesn't need a constant back-and-forth?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a media server in my basement; the problem is I didn't want to drill a hole in the floor and wire a 50-foot cat6 across my house to connect it to the network. After doing a little research online and consulting some local Bestbuy guys, I was suggested to use a mesh wifi system to extend the range of my router, so I picked up an eero 6 to do this.
 The only issue is that its speeds are up to 500mbps, and I have AT&T fiber, so my average speeds are up to 1gbps. The server will be at the other end of the house in the basement from the router (the house is about 1000sqft), and I'm afraid that connecting the mesh to my router and then placing one of the eero nodes in the basement to directly connect to the NAS will drop my speeds considerably. Is this a legitimate concern to have? If I absolutely must, I can wire it with ethernet to the ISP-provided router.

 I wanted to know how do you plan for disaster recovery on your home servers.
 Filesystems are easy to backup to an external disk, and it is not hard to send the data to S3 or rsync to another server on a friend's home.
 But I was thinking about databases and so on. Do you have some kind of WAL logs, follower replicas and so on?
 I am curious about your experiences.
 (Lighting candles to some deity to ask for the longevity of the hard disks doesn't seem to work well enough)

 I created a VM and wanted to duplicate the setup I had on the RockPro: basically a series of Docker containers (a personal start page, website, etc) behind a Traefik container. However, I cannot seem to access any of my docker services from their domain name (e.g., start.mywebsite.com).
 My VM is connected to the internet (I can SSH and ping google.com). My Docker logs don't seem to report any errors. It appears Letsencrypt has valid certificates. So I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. My hunch is some proxmox networking setting. Any help is much appreciated!

 Essentially the current workflow (unchangable) is that you have to fill out a paper form. I'd like to make this a bit easier for everyone by:
  
Uploading the paper PDF
 Selecting the fillable components
 Using those to build a form 
  
Then the end user would be able to:
  
Fill out the web form (and possibly cache fields)
 Receive a completed PDF via email.
  
I've found an number of PDF manipulation components out there but no "package" that has even a majority of these items rolled in to one. I'm hoping the community may be able to provide some recommendations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been blessed by an acquaintance of mine with a 4 blade/node server. I had experience with running a 2U server already but with this new one being 4 nodes I want to look into booting them over PXE. I have looked through many guides and they all seem to say similar things, but I have a few questions that I can't seem to get a concrete answer to if someone with experience can help with PXE.
 So with it being 4 nodes I don't want to use 4 different bays just to boot each of them up, I plan on using them for different use cases (a next cloud, and other hosted web-services) and my biggest question is if PXE is a suitable solution for this.
 It seems like PXE is really meant to only boot up installation media to install onto a local disk, so does that mean it isn't really for my use case, since I'm trying to avoid allocating 4 bays just for each node's boot drive. I have heard of iPXE which then uses ISCSI or NFS for persistant user data, which seems to be what I want, but I'm not looking for each node to boot the same files as they will have completely different use cases.
 Anyway, my main question is this, I want to be able to boot all 4 nodes up and each node just running like a standalone server that each has their own web-services to host, all while booting from a PXE server so that I don't have to have a local disk for each of the 4 nodes. I am not looking for someone to explain how to set it all up, I just want to know if PXE booting can do this for me or if I'm sort of barking up the wrong tree and should be looking at a different method entirely.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I just purchased 2 disk shelves (SYS-937R-E2JB), one with a compute module and I've never had something like this. I currently have 2 x R620s that I want to turn into a Proxmox Cluster. 
 My current plan is to use the compute module on this to install something like TrueNAs, put a 10 gig NIC inside, and have it act as the shared storage for the proxmox HA cluster. Will this work? 
 My second question is how best to set things up as it's another area I'm very noobish with. If I go with TrueNAS, I assume I can setup multiple disk pools/file systems? I've got two primary goals:
  
High speed disk storage for my VMs (only a dozen or so, but I'm impatient, so fast disk IO would be nice). I'd love to be able to clone an ubuntu template in a matter of minutes. 
 Raw storage for my media library and other personal documents (with the appropriate backups in place). Current storage usage is around 18 TB on Unraid. 
  
With the above in mind, I was thinking about trying ZFS in a mirrored config (raid 10 equivalent) for the VM disk storage, and maybe another pool that is made up of raidz2 for the media? 
 I could also try something like ceph or gluster with the 2 x R620s, and just put 6 x SAS drives in each one...that would eliminate the need for a high performance raid in the disk shelf. My goal is a redundant cluster as I want to start self hosting some important things and would prefer to avoid the risk of downtime etc. 
 ​
 At this point I'd appreciate any general suggestions/advice. I'm not even sure if I can do what I'm thinking, and if I can do it, I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. I did some reading up yesterday on trying to implement high IO ZFS for VM storage and it got over my head pretty quickly.

I have 8 or so Raspberry Pi 4's that are PoE powered. I'm experimenting heavily with orchestration in my lab. The lack of a CLI really makes it difficult to script switch-level changes easily. If it weren't for the fact that I can't really script against the GS324TP I'd probably buy a second one.
 My ideal solution:
  
Has POE.
 Has a web interface for when I need it.
 Has a CLI a really good means of faking by wrapping HTTP calls to a CLI interface for scripting purposes.
 Massive bonus points if it's easy to swap out the OEM fans with ultra quiet Noctua fans!
  
I don't think I'm ready for a Cisco or Juniper. I mainly want the CLI so I can bind some ports to specific VLANs on the fly.

 HP 800 g2 i5 6500 non "T" so 65W as I remember
 My fan under HDD bay (rear fan as 901 error code mentions) is loud as heck. 
 I simply cannot find option to tune this to normal speed (volume), nor option to simply unplug it (901 error during POST and enter to continue - no option for a leave-me-alone Homelab setup)
 Did you guys managed to workaround? I can even agree to leave this one but with reasonable voltage/PWM curve as now it's driving me crazy even with basic setup.
 I know that for other models some of you figured how to short some pins to bypass this check and this could be an option too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year I published the first beta release of YT-RED, originally written for downloading media from Youtube and Reddit.
 I received a lot of great feedback from r/software including a couple great suggestions for improving the overall program. I am very thankful, and happy to say that some great enhancements have been made over the last 5 months.
 YT-RED v1.0.2.0 Beta is now available
 Included in the update is a major overhaul of the UI, reducing the original 2-tab design to a single tab (suggested by u/Kendjin) that supports downloads from Youtube, Reddit, Instagram, Twitter, Vimeo and more.
 Another neat feature included in the update is automatic ID3 tagging for audio downloads, including thumbnail images (requested by u/asifaqeel50)
 YT-RED is and will always remain Ad-Free and Completely Free to use with no tracking or data-collection, and public source-code on GitHub.

 Please Note - YT-RED is not an open-source project While YT-RED source-code is made public and uses several open-source libraries and resources, I unfortunately cannot label it as "open-source" as it uses paid-license WinForms controls by DevExpress. While anybody is free to download the source code, it will not build without a valid DevExpress WinForms license.
 If anyone has read this disclaimer and still has an interest in contributing to the project, I'll be more than happy to work with you.
 Thank you all so much for your support earlier this year. Please feel free to leave any questions or feedback in the comments.

 I would ask your help to figure out the differences in term of power consumptions of my servers/builds.
 I have two builds, the oldest based on Intel and newest based on AMD.
 I took a lot of measurements, but here I will reports only the good ones. I excluded the windows test (to exclude a bad linux power management) and the test with the additional components.
 Basically, the intel build has a lower power consumption of at least 10W on all test.
 
 Given below the base configuration:
 Intel Based Build
  
CPU: Intel i7 7700
 Motherboard: Gigabyte H270N-WIFI (Mini ITX)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Hopefully someone here will be able to point me in the right direction, because I'm currently at my wit's end. I'm running a jellyfin media server on my nas, and I can only seem to make it accessible on my home network, no matter what configuration changes I make, and at this point I'm out of ideas.
 I have a domain registered through Cloudflare pointing at my home IP address, a WebStation portal for that domain pointing to the correct port, and another one just for that port. It's accessible just fine on my home LAN, either through [hostname].local:[port] or through Synology QuickConnect, but if I try to connect through my domain, it just displays the standard "Your website is not set up yet" splash page that it usually shows when webstation isn't set up properly, and if I try to use QuickConnect, it just won't connect at all. I have port forwarding set up on my router for the relevant port, and I plan to eventually set up ssl for the jellyfin instance, but for now I just want it to connect at all.
 I don't have much experience with networking (I started and didn't finish a CS degree) and I'm frankly all out of ideas. I'm really hoping someone here has had similar problems in the past.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey /r/homelab
 My lab consists of a 1U server colocated in a local datacenter. It has a ton of CPU, RAM, and Storage for me and my friends to play around with. I've been running XCP-NG on it for years now. Looking to replace the server soon and may change hypervisors. I've run ESXi before but have not dived too deep into it. Does ESXi have these features or some equivalent?
  
Can vCenter manage the host behind a virtual network? Some background, the server only has 1 physical uplink that grabs my one IP. This IP goes straight into pfSense so the host itself has no physical network access. Because of this, I have to configure Xen Orchestra to manage the host via virtual adapters.
 Does vCenter offer "resource groups"? Xen Orchestra allows you to create Resource Sets. These are set limits on CPU/RAM/Storage that I can assign to a user or user group. This is great for allowing friends to play on my server without touching my stuff. I create a resource group, give them some resources, and they can then login into Xen Orchestra and create/modify/remove VMs at their will. They can't go over their resource limits, and they can't see or modify my VMs at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 Cal.com is a appointment booking tool that can tie into a CalDAV calendar. When you create a booking page on Cal.com, other people can use the page to make an appointment with you, and a new event will be added to a CalDAV calendar you specify. In fact, Cal.com can integrate with multiple calendars to help you let people book appointments while avoiding conflicts. Handy!
 However, there are some calendars I would like Cal.com to use for conflict avoidance that are published as .ics URLs only. And right now Cal.com can't subscribe to .ics feeds.
 My first attempt was to use my Nextcloud instance to subscribe to the .ics feed, then have Cal.com access my Nextcloud calendars via CalDAV. Unfortunately, Cal.com can only see CalDAV calendars that live directly in my Nextcloud instead of the .ics feed it subscribes to.
 Is there another intermediary CalDAV server that can subscribe to .ics feeds and exposes them as a read-only CalDAV calendars so that Cal.com can see them? Of course, the CalDAV server needs to refresh the .ics subscriptions frequently to reflect the latest updates.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey gang. For the past 8 years my main desktop computer / plex server has been a self built hackintosh (i5 4460, ~40TB JBOD). It's served me loyally, but I have a new remote work job, and it's time for an upgrade. I recently ordered a new Mac studio that will serve as my new mothership for work and all my personal/important files... but I still want to repurpose this old rig as a standalone plex server (and possible blue iris backup) since the hardware is still solid and the processor supports quicksync for hw transcoding (I'll probably upgrade the ram, psu, and move from sata cards to HBA, but i digress...) Here's my conundrum though.
 Part of me really wants to transition from this shameful jbod array with ~36TB of media to a more modern and manageable Unraid setup... however I'd have to ditch my cloud backup. B2 storage for this amount of stuff is prohibitively expensive for just a plex server. However, if I stay jbod on a standard desktop operating system (macos/windows/linux) I can keep all my data backed up on backblaze's desktop plan for 7 bucks a month. 
 Do I really need a cloud backup for this media? There's nothing I couldn't probably find on usenet if I had a major failure. Am I overthinking this? 
 Please help me see reason and figure out what to do. I've been going back and forth all week. Thanks.

 I just realized that this comes with a bunch of unforeseen issues. My mobile internet provider blocks all incoming connections before it even reaches my router, so I'm unable to port forward or connect to my server from the outside.
 For the past day I've been looking into solutions for this. My plan is to pay for a cheap VPS, and have my home server establish a tunnel to this, and let the VPS forward all traffic through the tunnel to my home server.
 At first, it seemed like a reverse SSH tunnel was what I was looking for. But reading up on it, SSH tunnels only seem to support TCP. While I found some workarounds this seems to complicate things unnecessarily.
 After some more research I found rathole which seems to do exactly what I need.
 Does anyone have any experience with this?
 Ideally I would like to use rathole to forward traffic from the VPS to my home server in order to establish a VPN connection through wireguard.
 This seems to be the right tool for the job. Is there anything I'm missing here?
 Also, does anyone know of a good cheap VPS that's suitable for this?

 Over time, it gathered more than 12000 changes across big and small Czech news sitest and article has been written about it's findings (but also in Czech).
 It's open-source and simple to deploy, if you find it interesting, you can take a look at the original version: headline.beta.nolog.cz And you can also change the monitored media and run it yourself, just edit the data/config.yaml and run it with docker-compose. 
 It crawls the declared RSS feeds, stores all the data in redis and compares it to previous crawls. If it finds a change, it's written to sqlite3 database and presented with python-flask in a simple UI.
 Have fun!

 My name is Floris Breggeman, and last year I did a survey on self-hosting to aid in my master thesis. Given the overwhelmingly positive response, especially to the results post, I decided to make this a yearly thing. This year I have no academic purpose anymore, I'm just doing it to satisfy my own, and hopefully your curiosity.
 The survey can be found here. I have updated the survey a bit compared to last years; I have accounted better for the possibility of virtualisation and asked more detailed hardware questions. The survey is also no longer on a per-server basis, and can be filled out if you own multiple servers. The survey takes about 20 minutes to complete.
 Of course, results will be posted back to this subreddit. Given that I no longer have any academic constraints, I should be able to post more detailed results than last year, and hopefully somewhat faster ;)
 I have already communicated with the moderators and gotten permission for this post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but:
 So, I got into hobby photography last year, and I'm currently in possession of nearly 2TB of RAW files.
 I was recently thinking about backup strategy for my pictures, and was thinking about if I should keep all, or be selective? 
 Currently my workflow is that I take e.g, 300-500 pictures in a run, get home, select the better ones, and leave all the others on my disk too. 90% of them are blurry, or over/underexposed, and kind of useless. I was thinking keeping them, but calculating for storage, backup and stuff, recently I'm about changing my mind. If I purge my library from unusable stuff, I'll have around some thousand pics instead of the 40k I currently have (from most of which aren't good), and I wouldn't need to be concerned about storage and backup for a while (reducing my 2TB of images to somewhere in the neighborhood of 1-200GB, which I can totally support with the current home and cloud infrastructure I use (inc. kept raw files).
 What do you guys think? 
 If there are any photographers/videographers here, what do you do with kind of useless material? You delete is? Or keep it either way? If keeping it, do you keep it in RAW or some compressed image format?
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post this, so very sorry if this feels a bit out of place. 
 I use a MBP 2021, so a macOS user but do have access to a parallels VM incase I need to use Windows programs. I have multiple HDDs and an SSD, but today an HDD I've used for around 5-6yrs started getting disconnected from my laptop with high frequency. And it was abysmally slow, the last time I checked it could only do 5mbps write when data wasn't being read/written to it in the background.
 I knew that the HDD was in its last legs, but I procrastinated over getting a new one just because I was naive and new to hoarding data. I quickly ran over to a store and bought a new 2TB WD HDD. 
 Now I've spent a few hours trying to switch my data, but it shows an estimated time to copy of about 20-45mins for a 500-700mb file. If I kept this pace, it'd take me like a week to transfer everything over, and doing a transfer like that freezes Finder even when I'm trying to move and browse through files even on my laptops on board SSD. I know that the bottleneck here is just the fact that my HDD is old AF and there's not much I can do except just move the files over a long period of time. But I came here looking for something that could help me in future if not now.
 Is there any way to make this painfully slow process even a bit more efficient and quicker? I'm currently using Finder's drag and drop copy paste feature.
 Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

 I have been trying to wrap my brain around ripping our large collection of dvds, Blu-ray’s, and 4K movies. 
 Maybe I’m dumb but my brain is hurting. I’ve watched YouTube tutorials and all that and I still can’t seem to find the “ELI5” tutorial I need to figure out what hardware and software I need. 
 Has anyone on this sub done a very simple tutorial? I searched past threads and can’t find just a simple tutorial, mainly I just find threads troubleshooting issues I don’t understand yet because I haven’t gotten that far. 
 Alternatively if anyone lives in Utah I will drive my collection to you and pay you to do this for me lol. Whatever you charge is probably worth it to me. I am very upset because I wasted tons of time entering all my digital codes on movies anywhere, iTunes, etc only to find out you can only download them for offline viewing for 90 days before you have to log in to verify you still own the device, etc.

 We run all our services in the cloud as of now, so all of that will go to "my" network lab.
 My plans for now are basically using the blades so students can format and put services to run on em to have server experience.
 And the rest - got no clue for now :P

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a used mini pc (NUC like) where i can connect an internal 3.5" hdd. Meaning it should have at least one sata port (in addition to one sata or m.2 for the system drive) and a power connector with 12V.
 I thought this couldn't be a complicated problem, but it seems like it is :(
 It has to be x86 because of software requirements (proxmox and maybe a windows guest) and it has to be a mini pc because of power consompution (with already .35€/kwh and likely more in the next months in germany this is quite important...) and space requirement.
 I'm looking for use devices on ebay because I don't want to spend over 200€ for the system including ram and system drive.
 Would be very happy about suggestions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Might sound dumb, but I'm a total noob. I've seen/read a lot on the internet about "you can't send email if port 25 is not open", which is often contradicted by articles that advise not to use it because ISPs hate it, and use port 587 instead. So do I actually need port 25? I want to use Axigen MTA on Google Cloud Platform, which has port 25 blocked, but port 587 open.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For new friends: Logto helps you build the sign-in, auth, and user identity within minutes. We provide:
  
An OIDC-based identity service
 The end-user experience with username, phone number, email, and social sign-in
 Support web and native apps with various SDKs
  
In the new release:
 We’re super excited to announce some new capabilities in this release that will make Logto more accessible to developers and users all around the world. Get a taste of them and tell us what you think! 
 Sign-in Experience i18n
 The warm reception Logto has received since its initial release in July has resulted in numerous language contributions from the community. This motivates us to localize and tailor the sign-in process even more.
 Now, we're ecstatic to announce that Logto Sign-in Experience has full support for i18n, which means your products can reach a wider global audience and offer more personalized and contextualized options for all users.
  
We have 6 predefined languages to choose from, all of which were created by our international community and can be modified to your liking.
 
Support for up to 113 language tags, allowing you to use your own translation in order to reach the vast majority of countries worldwide.
 
 The admin console already includes this functionality. The "Language" section in "Others" tab of the Sign-in Experience page is where you'll be able to rapidly set up and manage your keys and custom values.
 CLI: Exclusively for Logto
 Combating with complicated commands? That's not how we roll. So we're bringing some friendly little things to keep the elegance going even in the command line.
 If you're trying to install Logto on your machine, skip the long, scary install command. It now reads:
 bash npm init @logto 
 And you are all set. Check out Using CLI for a detailed explanation of how to use Logto CLI.

The use case is simple, I have some ansible playbooks that deploy my selfhosted services to a k8s cluster, this playbooks generate secrets and I would like to add those secretes automatically to my password database so I can access them easily and not having them lying around in some yml file and I can't be bother to register the by hand. 
 Which password manager can you recommend that supports this feature? Do you have any othe suggestions about how can I achive this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The title says it all. I've tried every combination of setting in the book and I can't get it to work.
 My config is 2XSSD 2-column mirror + 7XHDD 5-column parity on Win10 for Workstations. It sets up the tiers properly but then only allows the HDD tier to be used at 50% efficiency. Looking at individual disk IO I can see that it's striping only two disks instead of 5. Something seems to be forcing the config into mirror-mirror instead of mirror-parity.
 Please note that I'm talking about Storage Spaces, not Storage Spaces Direct. I've scoured the MS documentation and the internet and can't find any reference to Storage Spaces not supporting mirror-accelerated parity but it's Microsoft so who knows? Even MS tech support can't find a definitive answer for me as to whether Win 10/11 supports this.
 Have any of you ever gotten this setup working and, if so, how the hell did you manage it?
 Thanks!
 P.S. - And, with all due respect, please don't just suggest that I dump Storage Spaces and use some other product. It's not an option for this application. If I could do that I already would have.

 My first thought was something headless which accessed each link, then the "view as a single frame" link, and saved the content found behind it.
 I'm able to do this, and don't really need any technical help in doing so - I'm just wondering whether anyone has any better ideas?
 Some spider that can create a sitemap, maybe? An automated tool to download all images in some directory?

 I just installed Suricata onto my Windows 10 and configured the .yaml file tailored for my Windows 10 instead of Linux.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few years ago I bought a bunch of old used parts on eBay and build a modest server. It's a 4c/8T Xeon, m-ITX SuperMicro board, in a Node 804 case. I currently have 2x SSD cache and 5x HDD. I learned a lot but I've outgrown it and really want an upgrade. A few things I learned:
  
Regret the Node 804 case. Was a pain to build in. I wish I went full size ATX with a vertical stack of 8 drive bays. Eyeing the Fractal Design Define 7.
 Liked the piece of mind of ECC RAM and dual Ethernet
 IPMI came in clutch a few times
 I don't have enough cores/threads, I'd want at least 8c/16T next time
 I don't have enough PCI slots, only had enough room for one transcode GPU for Plex and one SAS card to expand the 6 SATA ports
 I wish I got a CPU with Intel QuickSync to use for Plex
  
So to address the PCI issue, I figured a board with 10 SATA slots (2x SSD cache, inevitable 8x HDD) would clear that up, be better for cable management, and be one less point of failure vs my SAS card. Plus if I could find a CPU with ECC and QuickSync I'd save a PCI slot. Now I'd have enough room for 1-2 GPUs to finally have better VM performance. I'd want 1 light gaming VM and 1 productivity/streaming VM which could benefit from a basic GPU. If I ever needed more drives I still have my SAS card. So 3 PCI total.
 Another thought, is 10gbe worth it? None of my devices are ready for it, but how nice is it for future proofing? My main computer is an M1 MacBook Pro so I at least have Thunderbolt 4.
 Lastly, I can see a benefit in having a second cache pool for VMs. Probably just a single M.2 drive for VMs.
 The issue with all of the above, is it seems a board that supports: ECC, IMPI, M.2, 10x SATA 6gb/s, Dual 10gbps Ethernet, is $570 which is a lot to go for. It seems only the SuperMicro X11SPI-TF checks all those boxes. Is it worth it in the long run? Or what compromises should I have? I'd appreciate any advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a Dell T110 with a Intel Xeon X3470 (circa 2011ish). It has the original 2 x 1 TB SAS drives and I have an old laptop HDD as a cache drive in unRAID. I have noticed recently when downloading torrents its is taxing the CPU to 100% which degrades the performance of all my docker containers. 
 My question ultimately is will upgrading the drives prolong the life of this server, or should I just build something new that is a little future proof? I want my sever to be a decent media server and also be able to host various VMs. Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, I'm looking for recommendations for dedicated Mac hardware to use as a build CI/CD server for some of my own projects. I've gone the route of VMWare / KWM / virtualization solution but the performance is poor and honestly just not worth the headache to hackintosh it from Apple.
 I've been looking at something like a 2019 / 2020 Mac Mini because the RAM modules should still be upgradeable. Are there any recommendations for specific Apple hardware that has a few years of OSX support still remaining? I've thought about doing a Macbook as well, but I plan to run it mostly headless, so the extra size is not something I'm eager to waste space on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I have a number of servers which are all encrypted or only grant access via a private ssh key. Furthermore I have my backups distributed on 3 locations. There are 3 to 4 copys of every file (raid not included). I use restic and btrbk.
 Now I was wondering - what if I loose all me 3 clients at once, let's say due to flooding. How would I be able to access at least one of my servers to regain all over access to the "fortress".
 I need some sort of an easy to remember, not password protected (ideally), public space to either host a ssh private key or even better my keepass db.
 Any ideas?
 If you have a similar setup, I would like to hear your fallback plan.
 So far I have the following ideas:
 Gist / pastebin a ssh private key somewhere.
 For an attacker it's hard to find the right user, server, port combination (but not impossible!). The server could host the keepass db or other files. Downside, after, let's say a flooding, it might takes weeks before I would care about accessing my servers again. There is a chance that I'll even forget the combination.
 Public cloud, gdrive, more or less similar to gist / pastebin.
 Hosting the keepass db files itself, seems to insecure to me, even if my passphrase has 30 characters. Someone could just download it and use high powered brute force to crack it.
 Another idea would be a second keepass db on a public cloud, with a private ssh key and only hints, that would help me remember, but not give anything away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since setting up my UnRAID server, I am pondering how to sort out all my documents. The sorting of these is a work-in-progress after a massive scanning session, and now the documents are sitting in a network share. Some are nicely named and live in a sensible folder structure, and a lot aren't - at least for the moment.
 I had considered using Paperless-ngx as a way to use automated tagging and OCR to make searching for things easier in the future. However, I believe that Paperless-ngx works by consuming documents within an 'import' directory, and from that point on the document will live within the docker container. This doesn't seem great to me as I'd rather have full control of the document locations.
 Am I correct in my thinking? I was wondering if there's a document system that works similar to how PhotoPrism works: point it at a directory and let it chew over everything there, writing tags and other information to its own database while leaving the original files untouched.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any wisdom shared.

Before I start throwing anything of matter on it I want to make sure it is secure. Typically I would install a firewall VM and route traffic through it. However this machine only has one IP and I cannot order another one as it is not even an option. All the writeups I see require using two IP's. I did find a good writeup of using shorewall but it was from 13 years ago so it did not apply to todays setups. So with all that said: any tips on securing this box to where I can run everything through a firewall vm, still access it remotely, and expose a few ports?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I don’t know how many of you saw them but I noticed that at some point I’ve the last year or two Amazon started selling ridiculously large storage capacity drives from unknown non-brands. In the past I bought those Samsung SDD drives t5 and t7. These non brand ones are clearly made to look almost identical to Samsung one except to mention of Samsung. Their colors, their shapes, and printed text on look just like Samsungs except they are.
 I tend to believe that something that is too cheap and offers too much for much less is probably somehow compromised in quality. So, I was wondering whether anyone has bought and used those, or maybe checked who makes the drives inside
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's a 3 prong outlet, but the ground is broken somewhere. Unfortunately it's not right behind the outlet (I checked, wiring looks fine), so fixing it myself is beyond my skill level...guessing it would require running a new line, which is probably 1k+ from an electrician. So options are pay for that (f-me), install a gfci outlet (I know this won't really help with surges), or use it as-is. 
 It's hard to explain, but it's in a difficult location and I can't really run an extension cord to another outlet unless I want to get something like 50ft or more and run it around door frames. 
 So...am I SOL?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey homelab. I'm finishing up wiring my house for ethernet, but while I have the walls open I want to run some fiber from my rack to the wall where my utilities come in. 
 Centurylink in my area (Chandler, AZ) keeps saying they'll have fiber in my neighborhood "soon" and I want to futureproof, but I've never worked with fiber before in any capacity and I have no idea what I need to buy.
 Currently, they appear to be using Adtran total access 352 (based on what my coworker has) but all I can find is that it needs an SC/APC connector, and that its 1 fiber. Do I need single or multimode fiber? And what diameter fiber?
 Additionally, are there any other fiber cables I should run to the wall to better futureproof? I'm not sure if residential fiber standards may change by the time they get to my neighborhood, but I've already run 2 ethernet cables to that wall as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an external (USB-connected) HDD formatted with NTFS that I want to move its files to another HDD formatted with Ext4 (and later to another HDD formatted with Btrfs). Since many of my files on the NTFS volume have strange filenames (UTF-8, Asian characters, etc.), I'm afraid the NTFS driver on Linux would mess things up.
 An experienced user suggested using Samba/CIFS/SMB file sharing to transfer my files, using a Windows VM on my laptop and a virtual network adapter (unfortunately, I don't have any other computers). I'm running Fedora 36. This sounds complex and confusing to me because I'm a noob and don't know much about networking. I've already installed the Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox, and spent so many hours trying to find something from the internet, but I'm lost.
 Your help would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Ubuntu VM set up with docker and Nginx-Proxy-Manager (NPM) (plus some other containers to test with). I have ingress the proper ports and can reach my services thru <public ip:port>. On Cloudflare, I have an A record for <domain.cloud> pointed to <public ip> and CNAMEs for <service>.domain.cloud pointed to <domain.cloud>. Cloudflare origin certs have also been added to NPM for HTTPS.
 The problem is getting NPM to resolve. No matter what I've tried, I cannot get DNS to resolve any service. I've got ingress on 80 and 443, I've checked and added them to ip-tables, and even tried creating and using a load balancer. 
 I've had a homelab set up in my house for couple years now, so setting up NPM and cloudflare isn't anything new to me, what is new to me though is the Oracle Cloud side of things.
 Also, I have a Cloudflare tunnel set up and working, no problems. But I don't want to use the tunnel for a few services (Jellyfin, Audiobookshelf, Kavita, anything that streams any kind of media) because I don't want to deal with worrying about breaking CF's ToS or anything, hence why I want to use NPM.
 I've tried to search for a solution on Google many different ways, and nothing has helped. What am I missing here? Please help and thank you.
 EDIT: Currently, resolves with Bad Gateway Error 502, but I've seen others as I've tried different things, 502 being the most common.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My 8TB external WD hard drive is almost full (80GB remaining). It contains video and subtitle files. I've been storing data in it for over 2 years. I recently read that the magnetic tape will lose data over time. There is also the added risk of hard disk failure (although I only use it for storage).
 My question is: how long should I wait before I transfer data to a new disk drive or is there a software for refreshing data like Diskfresh etc?
 I've also had two separate 1TB drives for audio storage and have been using them for 7 years without any sign of data degradation (some files are over ten years old).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the near future, I plan to purchase eight hard drives, at 16+TB each for my Synology Diskstation 1815+ (I am considering upgrading to the 1821+ model but someone told me that Plex is better with the 1815+). I currently have eight 8TB drives, but they are full.
 So far the best deals I found are:
 WD Red Pro 16TB at $299.99 each on many websites.
 Seagate Enterprise 16TB at $219 each https://www.ebay.com/itm/354163479355
 Toshiba Enterprise 18TB at $285 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093Z5LFWD?th=1
 Not a complete deal breaker but someone told me that enterprise hard drives can be quite loud.
 I checked out https://shucks.top/ but seems I will save only about $10 per drive to shuck them and they won't be red.
 I also checked out https://diskprices.com
 My main uses for my NAS will be downloading, seeding, storing, and playing music and movies via Plex.
 Thank you for any advice that you may have.

 I used the browser plug-in on Edge and the Android app. This setup has worked flawlessly for about 10 months until today. I went to update a password in through the Edge plug-in and received the "Failed to fetch" error. Then I went to update the password through Android app and received the "Chain validation failed" message.
 A little searching suggests that this is due to my cert, but when I checked the status with certbot, it says it's valid and doesn't expire for another month. Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I only have a couple of users, but it's still very useful for me.
 If you don't know, authentik is an identity provider that supports OpenID, SAML, LDAP and Proxy Auth out of the box.
 I have secured all my services with it, and it's working great.
 It can also do MFA authentication, except with LDAP.
 Previously i've used LDAP servers and keycloak but authentik was much easier to setup and maintain.
 The biggest issue i've ran into is services not supporting central authentication, but that was only a few of them, and i've mostly switched to alternatives.
 I suggest everyone set it up in their selfhosted environment - it makes it feel a bit like an integrated "cloud"
 some of my notes about doing this:
 OpenID/SAML make your apps redirect to your authentik instance's login screen which can be customized. You only have to login to authentik once, and then just grant the applications access when you login to them. 
 LDAP should be used as a last resort, as it doesn't have 2fa and is quite an old protocol, so I suggest using it only when an app doesn't support other options. 
 Proxy auth also displays the login portal, but it works on the reverse proxy level, so reverse proxy forwards requests to authentik, which makes sure the user is authenticated. Authentik then forwards the requests to the app, with a special header with the username. This option is best for static/single page/single-user apps, but not ideal for most of them as it will break mobile apps and some APIs due to it's low level nature. Some apps have explicit support for proxy auth and work just as well with it as some do with OpenID. 
 Authentik docs have per-app instructions which show the recommended way to set it up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. 
 I want to set up a VPN so that servers that I connect through it doesn't know I am connecting through VPN. I used WireGuard on rented VPS for those purposes. But the main problem is that VPN server IP is easily recognized as IP that belongs to hosting provider. So what I decided to do is to put Raspberry Pi at my home and set up WireGuard on it. 
 But I run into a problem. I need to be able to connect to WireGuard server (peer) from outside. And my internet provider doesn't provide me with a public IP to my router, rather than router is behind internet provider NAT which I can't control.
 There is an option to opt into static IP. But they might have a separate pool of static IP, which may raise some red flags that I might be using a VPN. Also, preferably, I wanted to have different incoming and outgoing IPs of my VPN.
 One of the possible ways is reverse tunnels to Raspberry Pi. But since ping is also an issue, I either have to have a server in the same city or use a direct connection.
 What are my best options? My main priorities are to keep my VPN IP less suspicious and keep ping as low as possible (but the distance between server and client is 7000km+, so extra 10-20 ms won't matter).
 If reverse tunnel to can I do it all purely on WireGuard. Let's say I have peer with public IP to which both VPN server and client are connected, and use VPN server as gateway on my client?
 And are there any options to connect directly? I heard something about STUN, but haven't tried it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm interested to hear what kind of security and monitoring measures you all use for your servers and the services that you're self-hosting.
 My approach isn't very extensive so I'm looking for areas where I could make some improvements. So far it's:
  
Tighten SSH 
 Use SSH keys for authentication
 Disable root login
 Change the default port for SSH connections
 Tweak some of the miscellaneous settings in sshd_config
 
 Use fail2ban
 Use Cloudflare (DDoS protection features, caching reduces load on origin server, hide origin server for DNS entries)
 Deploy apps dockerised when possible
 Use NGINX as my web server/reverse proxy 
 Force HTTPS connections
 Use NGINX authentication for services
 
 Use a password manager to generate strong credentials for every service/account.
  
Some things which I'm looking to add in the future are:
  
A backup solution for logs and other important files, on a daily basis
 An extra layer of authentication via Authelia or something similar
 Remote access for sensitive apps via a Wireguard tunnel (though this isn't something I need, at least for now)
 Find some kind of monitoring solution for app and server logs
 Find a Intrusion Detection System to use but I don't know if this is overkill?

 This actually is a compilation of several questions. I have a WireGuard VPN, Nextcloud and a 3D Printer with web frontend set up and I would (ideally) like access to all under one domain, even from outside the local network. I already have a DynDNS provider set up, so the WireGuard traffic is routed consistently even with changing public IPs. However, I can not directly access for example nextcloud under that domain, since only my custom WireGuard port is exposed.
 Currently, I do have access to everything even from the outside, but I have to type the IPs in the VPN of the respective server to access it. Curr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m an software engineer, comfortable with his homelab running kubernetes. At the moment I’m working on a free app for mobile and pc. 
 I want to offer users a place where they can leave a ticket if they have a problem. I have a strict user data policy, that I won’t collect data within the app. I know to submit a ticket the user will send data, and I’m collecting it. The best I can offer is a selfhosted solution, so it won’t leave my server. 
 My question for you guys is what would you recommend?
 Here is some info/requirements:
  
I’m very busy so I would like to be a fire and forget solution I could deploy simple on my cluster. An helm chart ofc the most simple.
 
I don’t have employees and don’t have plans to hire anyone so no need for collaboration functions. 
 
It doesn’t need to be fancy for the users. They just need to be able to leave feedback/problem tickets.

I've also recently learned about the existence of nucs. 
 I can't for the life of me figure out the difference. They are similar in price. They seem to have the same components. They seem like exactly the same devices. What exactly is the difference between a thin client and a nuc?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, apologies if this is not particularly the appropriate subreddit for this post. I figured it might be worth a shot given the nature of the situation.
 I'm trying to digitise a small handful of VHS tapes. My original plan was to plug my VCR into the Xbox One via an AV-HDMI adapter/upscaler, and then use OneCast to connect from my computer and just do a screen cap. The problem now is that Microsoft have locked down the OneGuide app that takes in HDMI input and doesn't allow apps like OneCast to stream from that app anymore (same with apps like YouTube etc.). Maybe somebody knows of a different app that can capture an Xbox stream?
 Short of buying a capture card, are there any ways around this? Having a device in front of me with HDMI in and out, plus a 2-way AV-HDMI adapter, plus a VCR and a computer is making me think there has to be a solution with what I have.
 Again, I know the most obvious solution is "buy a capture card". I'm just trying to work with what I have at the moment. And if I do end up needing to purchase one, what would be your (budget) suggestions? Thank you in advance, and sorry for the wall of text!

 ​
 you will find the detailled instruction on github : NAS low Power Low Cost
 (step by step for the beginner like i am. from flashing the SD card to setting the SBC bootloader to look for USB drive to boot, to setup SSH and each of the basic services)
 for the hardware : it's a rockpro64 with 6x SATA 3.5 Drive (under 50W during start up, 200$ without drives)
 for the software : armbian with ZFS (this is story in itself as it was non trivial to get ZFS to run on ARM hardware with armbian), docker to host my service as container, cockit for a nice and shiny dashboard of the server and portainer for the container management
 on the service side :
 - syncthing : (selfhosted onedrive with syncronisation of my data accross all my device, easy to setup and use)
 - radicale cardav (but a nasty bug deleted all my calendar event when another got added from another device so I need to investigate and maybe replace it)
 - dashy (custom dashboard because it's a must around here and it's easy to setup)
 - transmission for torrents
 and many more to come as i only use 40% of the 4GB of ram and under 20 % CPU

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I downsized my computer to a ITX form factor, thinking I could spend maybe £10-20 on a docking station for my six 3.5" drives . Honestly shocked to see how much they cost. They're basically a cheap piece of plastic with daisy chained SATA connectors, USB, and a 12v out. Really nothing complex. Looking at £80-100+ for that. Madness. I know inflation is bad all-round, but items containing such materials can still be produced rather cheaply.
 I'm actually regretting throwing away the Western Digital enclosures that the hard drives come in originally.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a professional photographer (on the side, full time back end infrastructure engineer full time) and I have been thinking about reducing the impact of storing ~1Tb of RAW photos and/or video from each client project. 
 My idea take inspiration from a (mostly) immutable backup project I am working on at work. Use tapes. To set the stage I am looking at this from a "per-project" standpoint not a "backup my entire storage infra" standpoint. 
 I think would easily be able to fit a entire project (wedding, event, concert, etc...) on a single LTO-5 tape. With that I would double up and mirror the tapes and then just have them in a decent (but not great, admittedly) climate controlled environment for potential future access for up to 2-3 years after the project. So effectively I keep the "good" raw's and clips on my main storage array and then offload all of the project as a snapshot onto 2 identical tapes (original files, project files, and final exports).
 My goal is to reduce the spinning disks I need to maintain, decrease power usage, and decrese the space utilization of one off projects that I will likely never need to touch again, and still maintain that data for as long a possable for my own comfort and client good will. 
 I am thinking I can find a LTO external SAS drive for ~$350, tapes for ~$9 per, and use something like bacula to manage the tapes.
 Thoughts?

 I know that we can ask DDNS providers (like DuckDNS) for a subdomain (e.g. example.duckdns.org), and it will point to my IP as long as I keep updating DDNS entries with tools like ddclient.
 Say I buy a domain from some domain registrar. What do I need to do to ensure the domain points to my IP? Does it still involve DDNS providers? And is the process different with different registrars?

 I have the DNS set to the IP of the firewall and another to 8.8.8.8.
 Upon removing 8.8.8.8, DNS still does not resolve, but I lose internet access. This leads me to believe the tunnel cannot get to IP_OF_FIREWALL for DNS requests.
 I can ping and access everything (including IP_OF_FIREWALL) by IP on my subnets, but DNS will not resolve.
 I have tested this on Windows and Android, both externally. Everything works except DNS.
 ​
 I feel like I'm missing something here whether that be a firewall rule or something stupid. Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

It really seems like unlimited cloud storage is dead, and doing the math, backing up my 18TB ZFS pool to e.g. B2 would cost $90 a month (!), compared to what I paid with CrashPlan before they went belly up. And I was on backblaze until I stopped daily driving a single windows machine. 
 I’m gonna shut up before I ramble, but I’m curious because searching around the sub I sure get that impression.

 I looked into following options but all store data unencrypted:
  
Synology - SMB
 Raspberry Pi OS - SMB
 OpenMediaVault -SMB
 Create Veracrypt container on a SMB shared folder. But as SMB is file level storage, wouldn't it upload/update the whole file when a change is made inside the Veracrypt container?
  
Any recommendations for SMB? Preferring it due to the robust support available across OSes.

 After some research, I found that the general answer is a NAS. However, I find this solution to be much more of what I need: a place in my local area network to put my stuff.
 Do you have any advise? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got some music on my hard drive which I listen to and seed via bittorrent. Problem is, it is a lot of random folders, some with discographies, some with separate albums, all in different formats, with a lot of broken tags and some other weirdness. I'd want to back all this up in a more organized format: something like a bunch of "artist/album" folders, with all the files in a single format (AAC, maybe?) for file compression. 
 For that, I've tried using SoundConverter. While it does work, more or less, it is quite bugged - sometimes it just puts files in random places, it can't handle album icons, and when there are issues with tags (No tags, tags with spelling issues, tags with encoding issues, you name it) it does weird things. 
 I thought about trying to hack around some Python to do that for me, but I feel that it is a problem which is probably solved already. Despite that, I wasn't able to find any software better then SC. What programs do you use to organize your stuff?

 hi all,
 my archive recently is growing fast, and so is my worry of file corruption**–** mostly involving compressed archives and iso's
 so i ask, what is the best way to handle such file? it is to decompress and store them or just store the compressed archive in a dedicated section? and the iso's?

 Backstory is my 18 year old nephew is using dodgy movie watching sites and such on the WiFi at his Nans and Moms house which raises concerns with the ISP and possible viruses. I've tried advising him so far from an IT Professional standpoint but he's still playing the "I know better" card with his Mom and Nan so they want a solution from me to stop him doing those things on their networks as they don't trust him to listen to what I've told him (and I'll be doing it on mine but I already have better routers)
 Naturally because he's 18 so software on his laptop isn't an option so content filtering at a network level feels the best way to go.
 tl:dr - I need a method to block certain content for a certain device (or devices) at a network level as a software block can't be installed on the devices

 I'm interested in getting a NAS, although I'm having some trouble on what route to take, hoping to get some advice here
 I'm currently debating on whether I want to buy a Synology NAS or maybe just finding some old PowerEdge tower server that can fit 4 bays (going to be buying 4x4TB Red Plus HDDs, should be sufficient for my storage needs ~ for now ~)
 But the Synology NAS is quite expensive, around $550 here in Canada - pre tax
 I don't mind the cost, but one thing I plan on doing is accessing this NAS outside the network, going to be keeping it at my parents until I have a big enough space to keep whatever I get
 Would the Synology NAS be good in this case? 
 I've searched around on the subreddit but haven't had much luck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I like running a command to essentially mirror my 6TB drive to another identical 6TB drive every week or two. For now, I prefer it to RAID. The command is set up to only mirror files that have been changed, rather than copying EVERYTHING each time. Th initial mirror back in the day was a big one, but all subsequent ones just update what's been changed.
 The issue I have is that the destination drive ends up with less available space than the source drive, even though they should be identical in size after the mirror.
 Currently, the source drive shows 276GB/5.45TB free, while the destination drive shows 178GB/5.45TB free.
 If I click into each drive and manually check all the file sizes, they come out identical, yet somehow the drive summary graph always shows higher usage on the destination drive.
 I have hidden files being shown, including protected OS files. I should note that both drives are separate from the OS drive, and only used to store media files.
 I don't have any compressed files on either drive. Both drives have a cluster size of 4096 Bytes, with 512 Bytes per sector.
 I'm just stuck scratching my head as to why the drives show different file sizes. It's like there's a super-hidden file somewhere on the Destination Drive, but I can't find it. Any guidance is appreciated!
 EDIT: Here is the RoboCopy command for reference: robocopy P: B: /mir /v

 I am starting building my home lab and I plan to have a 1 node k3s cluster to host a few apps for personal use, like NextCloud, Jellyfin, PiHole, etc.
 While some might say is overkill, I like the ease of deployment and management that k8s gives, using industry standard practices and tools like GitOps with FluxCD.
 It will also be a great way to increase my k8s knowledge and to play with tools like Prometheus for monitoring, Istio, etc, in a more real-life scenario. And will be a lot funnier too :)
 I also have an old QNAP NAS, that I use to store media and backups. Eventually, if I install NextCloud or Jelyffin in my K8s cluster, I would like to use the NAS as storage device.
 My main doubt right now is if I should get a new and more powerful NAS with like 8 GB RAM and a Quad Core…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have used Nginx Proxy Manager for a while now as a reverse proxy and to manage my SSL certificates, for items like my own static site and Jellyfin, and I never have much trouble getting it to work. I've decided to try out Nextcloud, and to make it available externally, but I'm having nothing but trouble getting the certificates created.
 Nextcloud is running with Linuxserver's docker container (I also tried the official one, and ran into similar issues), with the following docker compose setup:
 version: "3" services: nextcloud: image: lscr.io/linuxserver/nextcloud:latest container_name: nextcloud restart: unless-stopped environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - TZ=America/Chicago volumes: - ./config:/config - ./data:/data ports: - 8080:443 
 I have been able to verify it works correctly when accessing it from my local network. I created a new subdomain as I have done before, pointed it to the correct place, but NPM/Let's Encrypt will not make a valid certificate for it. Some settings:
 Domain name: nextcloud.mydomain.tld Scheme: https (I also tried http) Forward IP: My server's IP, as I use for other services Forward Port: 8080 Cache Assets - No Block Common Exploits - Yes Websockets Support - Yes 
 When creating a new SSL certificate:
 - Force SSL - HTTP/2 Support - HSTS Enabled - HSTS Subdomains 
 All of these are what I typically use. Creating the certificate fails simply with Some challenges have failed
 The one difference is that most things I have set up use port 80 or both 80/443. This is the first time I've set up a service that uses 443 by default, and I'm unsure if that would cause some change required. Other than that, I'm completely out of ideas.

 Several of drives have had same issue over the past few months: slow initialization/mounting and slow transfer time (around 10/mbps). I have seemingly tried all I can think of to isolate the issue: tried different Macs, different formats (APFS and Mac OS Extended), different cables, etc. Sometimes it improves, but then reverts back to being slow. The interesting thing is that I tried WD’s 2 TB models and have not had these problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have never archived any data before, and I think it's time to sort out my mess of hard drives before it's too late. 
 I'm looking at archiving my photos, videos and university work to optical media. I'm unsure if there is any benefit regarding longevity using M-Disc or archival-grade media over standard, good-quality discs.
 I understand that M-Disc claims to be 1000 years, and archival-grade DVDs and CDs around 100 years. I also understand that although manufacturers make these claims, proper storage of the media is necessary too.
 The data I'm storing will be split across a mixture of CDs, DVDs and Blu Rays so that it can be appropriately labelled and catalogued and stored on discs of appropriate size for their content.
 I have a spindle of 25x Verbatim DataLife BD-Rs but no other media at the moment. I am looking at Verbatim to ensure my discs are of good quality. I am considering Verbatim UltraLife Gold DVDs and CDs, but these are hard to source in the UK, so I want some input from others to see if it's worth importing them. I am undecided on whether I should use M-Disc Blu Rays or stick with Verbatim DataLife.
 I'd appreciate any feedback on this topic. 
 Many thanks :)

 I know I can setup notifications within many of these services. And many of them don't have notifications functionality built in.
 What I want is a tool that out of the box can scan log files for the services I choose and send notifications over whichever method I choose e.g. Discord, Email, Telegram, etc. This will break the dependence of the service itself having notifications functionality. Sort of like Zabbix, but with much more available templates that cover more services.
 EDIT: There are some must haves:
  
Web interface
 Easily available template configurations for different services like those mentioned above. I don't want to have to tinker and configure the alerts myself.

 An ‘old’ (was brand new but replaced by the 2TB SSD) 5400rpm WD blue has been repurposed for backup connected via a USB-C (2 disks) dock. I don’t know if it’s the 5400rpm speed or the dock throughput but I had to ratelimit backup as it was messing a Win10 vm. It’s still not perfect, backup take 12 hours for a 100GB disk. I am looking for a few solutions : - put 2 SSD in the dock (ZFS ?) - Buy a 5 disks USB dock with 3 or more SSD (ZFS ? Again) - Or... As many are complaining about these USB docks buying an old 1U disk rack on eBay. There’s so many options on eBay that I need someone kind enough to point me on the right product. Obviously there’s no 1U disk rack which can be connected via USB so it will be Ethernet and as far as I understood these have a CPU which means a OS so are file servers (correct me if I’m wrong). Can someone point Me to a cheap solution or another way of seeing things. Thanks for your help v.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is kinda a weird one for me. I can run the install exe fine. I can also run the program fine from winefile on the physical server itself. When I try to do the exact same over SSH it completely dumps my Xserver. 
 I've tried running directly from wine command using display commands to push it one past current display or current display
 I've messed around with winecfg to try and push it through different windows versions.
 Wine desktop crashes it as soon as I try to run exe. 
 I'm wondering if I need to move the program directly onto the native server and attempt to call it from there. 
 Anyone have experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at things like Next loud, OwnCloud, SeaFiles, etc, but just wanted any recommendations or personal experience of what might work best. 
 Here's what I have to pay with since migrating Plex to it's own box (for better CPU and UHD file playback) I have an old super micro board in a 4U EMC Isolon case. Currently running 24x 3TB drives dual Xeon E5645 CPUs (12c/24t total) and 128GB RAM. Like I said it's aging and now that storage has come down significantly I'd like to replace some drives for Plex and use some of these in RAID10 for a private/personal cloud. 
 My parents don't get cloud anything. Their 2TB backup drive, when not misplaced, is about half full, so I shared my M365 user acct so they have that to backup to, but it'd be so nice to be able to host stuff for my family and parents/siblings. That way any time they need help recovering folks or logging in/accessing, we're not resetting passwords or I'm remoting in to unlock, etc.. be nice to just send a link or have it as a mapped network drive or something. Yes their OneDrive is currently hosting the user files in Windows, but still. Something I'd like to get into just because. I suppose I could setup multiple instances to play, but like hearing feedback if possible.
 TIA

File sharing. This is obvious but I want to emphasize how seamless this is.

 Not sure if this is the right place to post, so apologies if not!
 I ran into an issue with the new Portainer update with the new UI. The font wasn't working and it came with this ugly serif font instead, however weirdly enough it displayed the font when Portainer wasn't accessed behind my reverse proxy
 With lots of googling I've managed to fix it to allow the font to load behind the reverse proxy!
 In your nginx reverse proxy security config under "add_header Content-Security-Policy", add the following "font-src * data: blob 'unsafe-inline';"
 For me, because I use OpenMediaVault this config file was located under /etc/nginx/openmediavault-webgui.d/security.conf, however varying on your setup you might find the CSP line in another file!
 Just thought I'd make this post in case anyone else ran into this issue, as I couldn't find anything similar on reddit quickly & easily. Hopefully save yourself some time if you run into a similar issue! That's all :)

I'm looking to control around 20 SATA CD/DVD ROM drives, so port density and cost become important. Is anyone aware of similar boards - I really liked that the HPM-XU used a USB-B connector instead of the MicroUSB.
 I'm putting all of this into a dedicated enclosure, which will connect via USB to a PC or laptop. I'm specifically looking for solutions that do not require a host computer/bus (other than USB) but do have power within my enclosure to power drives and cards like the U3-QS3.
 FWIW - Most off the shelf cheap USB3 -> SATA cables appear to not support ATAPI.
 I'm not interested in building a dedicated computer to do this - I want a USB3 interface I can move around, and plug into multiple devices w/out having to bring anything else with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this over to /r/linux4noobs but wanted to see what you guys thought of this.
 I have been using a Synology NAS for a while now. In addition to normal NAS stuff, I use it as a docker server for Jellyfin, Vaultwarden, and some other stuff. It has been working great but I wanted a beefer server for some other stuff.
 I recently reworked an old PC I had into an Ubuntu server (22.04.1 LTS), and have been working on setting it up, but was interested in some best practices for having the two servers work together.
 I want the NAS to continue to do what a NAS does best, being a file server. So I turned on NFS and have been mapping some of the shares over to the Docker containers of the new server. While learning about NFS, I found that with the user security uses the UID and GID of both servers, and ideally they match.
 So my question is what is the best way to do this? If I continue to use NFS, I need a way to synchronize the user and groups between the server. Should I just modify the UID of the main users on both servers to match? Or should I find a way to sync the /etc/passwd files?
 I am not against learning something like LDAP. I want a setup that will be expandable in the future if needed, so setting up something like this could be useful for creating a single sign on for everything. Or is this just overkill for a home-lan like mine? My main, non-server, computer is a Mac Laptop, so that could be integrated as well.
 Or is NFS not the best way to share directories from my NAS to the new Docker containers? Would SMB be better?
 The new Ubuntu server is pretty fresh so I would not mind changing its setup if needed, I just want to set it up the right way now, before I get too far down the setup path and have a lot of time invested in a dead-end path. I don't have any plans for more servers, but who knows what happens down the line if I start getting a bunch of rasperry PI's or something like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to host two different versions of NPM - one for my 'prod' services, i.e. ones that I've thoroughly tested and setup, and one for my 'dev' services that I'm still testing. I have two different docker networks - one is docker_prod and one is docker-dev. Both are going to be in different subnets by design.
 What's the best way to have two different instances of NPM, one for each batch of containers within it's own docker network? Right now, I've got 80/81/443 opened on my router and it points to my "prod" instance. I read about the --scale function but that seems to be for running multiple instances of a single container (i.e. for load balancing)
 Is there a clean way to approach this, or am I overthinking? Thanks for any help that is offered.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run plex and a number of docker containers, standard nginx webserver, and I use the machine for testing code, mainly python.
 I've been running this config in some fashion for around 5 years now. Just thought I'd get some feedback on better ways or more efficient ways.
 The machine is currently in the garage, not climate controlled. HD temps run around 35-40C sometimes in the summer up to 50c it get quite dusty. I was considering going synology with a a 5bay and a number of very large drives, just for plex
 This is the most recent iteration:
  
Supermicro H11SSL-NC AMD EPYC 7401 24-Core Processor
 128gb ecc RAM 2667MHz
 Nvidia p2000 gpu
 2x LSI HBA
 LSISAS3008 and LSISAS2008.
 2 x Thinkserver SA120 Direct Attached Storage
 2x 12 bays full of random drive sizes mostly shucked WD or Seagate Barracudas - one SA120 is backup zpool the other is active.
 (cron job rsync between them hourly)
 total size: 65TB for main zpool 25TB for backup zpool
 Ubuntu 18.04 LTS OS
 Case is just an EATX basic tower. Nothing special in anyway
  
before i go down this road. is it even feasible to get 60tb of space and have 4-5 simultaneous streams on something like a synology that is quiet enough to keep indoors in a home office?
 edit:
 tl;dr
 I guess my question is how do I achieve high amount of storage with the lowest noise and heat issues?

 I’m now starting to explore the wonderful world of sql and databases.( if this questions is best suited for another sub please let me know) or link to a guide. 
 I’m completely lost on how to do this. I thought it would be simply since the database is already setup and populated. I cant figure out how to send a local DB to Grafana. I’ve tried searching and can’t find the answer.
 I have a navidrome.db that I’d like to use with Grafana.
 How do I publish the Db? 
 I’m running Ubuntu 22.04 and navidrome is in a container. As of now Grafana is not in a container and installed directly. (Was just testing it with snap) 
 Thank you in advance.

 Is there a (free) thing like that out there ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow enthusiasts,
 I am currently running a Dell R630 server, which I need to return. My plan is to buy a refurbished HP ProLiant DL380e G8 for dirt cheap (around 300 Euros) and move my apps there. They are not CPU heavy apps. The OS is Windows Server 2012 R2. Both machines are on the same network and it doesn't seem to be any special configuration.
 The method that I'm planning to do is:
  
Start the Dell with Clonezilla as source
 Start the HP with proxmox installed and then a VM with Clonezilla as destination
 Make the migration and remove the source server from network.
  
Is this a valid approach? Is there any better way to do this?
 Has anyone encountered any Windows problems on the server migration?
 Thank you for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been looking at cloud storage options, and the best plan I've found is the Microsoft 365 Family plan, that with 6 accounts you can end up with 6TB of data for $100/yr.
 I'm wanting at least 2TB, though of course more is welcome, I'd be open to smaller plans that were at least 2TB if they were cheaper. Does anyone know any better cloud deals?
 Alternatively, what would be my better options for local storage? There are so many options here and terms I don't know, that I'm a bit lost. It looks like the startup costs would be relatively high, and then drives will need replacing fairly often, I'm wondering if at $100 a year (or less if anyone has suggestions) if the cloud would actually be cheaper than local storage in the long run.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked the previous owner of our house not to throw away what he didn’t want and wow do I have a lot to digitize and hoard. While digging through a large box of VHS tapes I realized I hadn’t seen most of these sleeves in 20+ years and felt they would be a good candidate to scan and upload to archive.org. I have the first 6 scanned and uploaded. Sadly most of the tapes have molded and with only 1 of 4 VCRs working I can’t risk playing a moldy tape. It’s sad as there are several marked as Bulls games from the early 90’s that would be awesome to have as the original broadcast.

 Needless to say this is no longer large enough to house all of my equipment in it so I'm looking to upsize to a 15U unit. I've come across a few via my searches on the interwebs but cannot land on one that I'm certain that I'll be happy with due to very mixed reviews in my price range.
 My specific requirements are:
  
34" or less tall (so 15U)
 Needs to be 24" deep (old brocade switch is 14.6" alone and until that gets replaced, yeah)
 Needs to wall mount and not want to fold itself
 Cost $307 or less including shipping to Florida
  
What are your go to options? I found a "Sysrack" 15U that looks decent but ive read everything from its fantastic to its probably going to fall off the wall.
 Thanks everyone in advance.

 I've seen in the tech specs of the various servers that the Intel graphics is "not support" due to firmware or chipset limitations. I've read this as output over VGA is not possible as the devices use a Matrox chip that works with the iDRAC.
 Curious if anyone knows if the iGPU is still usable in software for transcoding or 3D access by software. I've seen lots of well priced R240s and R340s cross r/homelabsales so hoping someone might have a good idea of whether it's still usable.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a plethora of Virtual machines running all different manner of processes and I need to monitor these services. 
 Since these processes have little standardization between them, I am struggling to find a solution to report process status. I run every OS you could imagine for various reasons (HAOS and other prebuilts are a pain) and they are all different types of processes from webhosts to game servers to file hosts etc.
 My plan is to have a web frontend that people can access to check the status of these various servers. I already have the login portal set up and hard coded a minimal webpage to list the services and their status in a 3-state icon. Running-Halted-Dead
 My plan as it stands is to have a python web framework like Django running to respond to http GET/POST for a status update on the webpage but this solution has proved to cause me more headaches than I would like to admit. CORS is a black box to me right now.
 Is there a platform agnostic solution to report the status of a selected process or group of processes upon http GET/POST? Even one for linux and one for windows would be better than what I have now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy homelabbers.
 I been playing with my Lab and got vMotion up, however I don't have anything for vSAN part. I looked at possibly grabbing another R420 or R620.
 My lab is currently made up of the following:
 2 x R420
  
E5-2450 V2 - 16C / 32T combined @ 2.50 GHz
 64GB of DDR3 ECC RAM
 Server 1: 4 x 300GB 2.5" 15K Dell Savvvio SAS
 Server 2: 2 x 2TB 7.2K 3.5" Dell Constellation SAS
 Server 2: 2 x 3TB 7.2K 3.5" Dell Constellation SAS
 ESXi 6.7 U3 Dell EMC
 6 NIC's Total
  
1 x R720
  
E5-2680 V2 - 20C / 40T combined @ 2.80 GHz
 128GB of DDR3 ECC RAM
 8 x 240GB 2.5" Kingston A400 SSD
 ESXi 6.7 U3 Dell EMC
 4 NIC's Total
  
1 x OptiPlex 7050
  
6th Gen i5-6500 - 4C / 4T @ 3.20 GHz
 32GB of DDR4 RAM
 256 GB Toshiba NVMe + 512 GB SanDisk Ultra SSD
 Windows Server 2022 Datacenter
 1 NIC
  
RPi 4 Model B 8GB Model
  
1 x 200GB Emtec SSD
 3 x 500GB 7.2K 2.5" Toshiba HDD
 OpenMediaVault
  
UDM Dream Machine Pro
 TP-Link 5 Port Switch
 I heavily use the RPi for NFS Datastores and house the ISO's there. But I would like to get something going for vSAN. I looked into StarWind VSAN Application but it's only 30 Day trial.
 So yeah. Looking for suggestions on best way to go about adding something to the lab for vSAN purposes. It can be physical or virtual solution.

 so i thought: hey, considering all the ports on a PC that a cable can convert to SATA from (eSATA, USB) why don't i get going with an external HDD library? it'd make a neat decor, and i've got a spare PSU. would that work? seems to me like yes. yes it does. i might get fancy and build a Jedi Library looking rack for my spare HDDs to be on display, for looks and ease of access, instead of shuffling them around in boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello homelabers,
 This is a long post so if you're not interested to help, just skip this post. (Also, I'm not sure if this is permitted in the sub, but looks like there is no rule mentioning not to ask for help choosing parts)
 As the title mentions, I need help picking parts for my upcoming server. Now before you jump at me, I have read the subreddit hardware guide but I'm not looking for a business server as it would be too loud.
 So, I have already chosen some parts (correct me if there is something to change to the existing chosen ones). Now, the CPU, Motherboard, and RAM are missing (the rest I will figure it out).
 The CPU would need to sustain at least this load, and a good overhead for future proofing, since I'm planning for keeping this around a long time (4-5 years) and more services will pop-up.
 The motherboard, well, I just need it to accommodate the basics + HBA & GPU
 The RAM, I would need it ECC, since I would be running TrueNAS (in a VM). 32gb should be fine but 64gb would be grate.
 The rest (CPU Cooler, Case, PSU, Fans) I think I can figure it out myself. 
 Any help is appreciated and have a great one!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm pretty new to this homelab stuff is please forgive me if this question is too basic. I did some searching about power on this forum and found a lot of guys quoting large numbers but the info on the setup was lacking.
 I am currently looking at acquiring a HP Proliant DL580 G8 4x Xeon E7-4890 4x 1200w and running a project that hopefully will eventually end up with it being maxed out (Lots of virtual machines).
 Now maybe I'm reading this wrong but according to the specs it says that each processor can pull 1200 watts max? Which checks out with the unit having four power supplies?
 My doubt is that since this is a home setup your average room's plug/circuit maxes out at a 1500w pull. Which means if each processor goes above 25% usage then it will blow the circuit. 
 Does this mean that people who run these out of their homes have massively beefed up their office/lab wiring to deliver all that power, or does the server just not actually pull that much at normal/low operation? 
 I'm happy to start off slow and just run one VM or two on the server while I figure out the power issue, but I'm trying to get an idea from you guys if I need to upgrade my houses wiring (since I do plan on maxing it out eventually), and if I do need to upgrade the home then how much do I realistically expect to draw with it running at low utilization at the beginning when I am learning? Would one plug be enough? An extension cord from another room and have two power supplies plugged in each?
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my entire IT career I've worked lower level jobs with the added bonus that I got to keep as much retired hardware as my wife would allow. Over the years I cobbled together some impressive bailing wire and duct tape solutions to accomplish what I needed to accomplish but I'm finally in a place where I can afford to spend a little money on my network.
 Goal: Centralize storage and management of media (and other things) at my parent's house. They have the space and a rack and we both have fast enough internet connections that a VPN tunnel works fine. I have a firewall at my house capable of acting as the host side of the tunnel and all I need on their end is a docker container.
 What I'll be running:
  
Some local storage for Plex - I have about 6 NAS drives ranging in sizes of 1 to 4TB (sets)
 Plex Server - Agnostic on how this is accomplished, I've done it as a Windows and linux VM, wouldn't mind trying a container
 VM to run VM and gather content
 Docker container for VPN tunnel
 Future - CCTV and storage?
 Future - home automation functionality
 Future - Some light VOIP stuff
  
I've worked with both Hyper-V and ESXi in the past, wouldn't mind giving ProxMox a look since I've heard good things.
 What I'm trying to figure out:
  
Where I should be looking for used/referb equipment.
 What I should be looking for spec wise.
 What is the best way to accommodate 6x 3.5" drives.
 
Am I better off looking at a separate appliance for the drives
  
Thanks for the ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While upgrading to an R720XD with disk redundancy, I quickly realized that you cannot directly passthrough a ZFS pool to VMs under a Proxmox server.
 I'm now facing the following options:
 a) Keep managing the ZFS Pool in Proxmox, and deploy a File-Sharing Container that mounts the ZFS Pool and re-exposes it via SMB or other protocol.> Not a big fan of this option, as it seems kind of hack-y and doesn't really allow the maximum performance if I need my VM to use the ZFS Pool to it's full extent.
 b) Install TrueNas Core in a VM and manage the ZFS Pools from there (Pool HDDs would be directly passed-through to that VM).> This seems like a cleaner solution, but leaves me with a question mark in regards to where I should host the various apps I want to run (Plex, *arr stack, Nextcloud, etc.). Would I want to use the integrated apps from TrueNas? Run them in a docker inside the TrueNas VM? Run them as a separate docker in Proxmox?
 Does anyone have a suggestion or a recommendation on the subject?
 I'm still kind of a noob in regards to homelabbing, only been at it for a couple of months, so my apologies if these seems like obvious questions!
 I might also be looking at this all wrong in regards to ZFS Pools and Apps under Proxmox, so feel free to correct me if it's the case!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Im curious if such a thing exists. The way I imagine it working would be in conjunction with a reverse proxy. Basically anytime someone types in "service.mydomian.com" the connection will initially be blocked. I would then recieve a notification on my phone or an email saying something to the effect of "111.111.111.111 is trying to connect to service.mydomain.com" and then provide the options of "Trust, Allow, Deny". 
 ​
 I like the idea of having yet another layer of security on my internet facing services. However from what I can tell things like Authellia would work just fine for loggining in from a webbrowser, but most of the things I have hosted are used through a companion mobile app and from what I can tell Authellia or others wouldnt work in that scenerio. 
 However if the Authentication was done on a secondary device and was completely invisible to the mobile app then I imagine it would work. Such as if I had a friend that I wanted to let use my server, they would download the app and try to login. On the first attempt they will just get an error that says they cant connect. But then I would get notified of the attempted connection where I can choose to permanently trust their IP, Allow it once, or Deny it. Then they try to login again and are able to connect. 
 ​
 Does something like this exist? Or is there a better way and I'm just way overcomplicating things?

 I have a domain with DNS through CloudFlare that I host at home. Recently, I've noticed a huge spike in requests, over 600,000 the other day, and 100,000 in the past 24 hours. I'm not too concerned, but it got me thinking. CloudFlare doesn't provide me with much information since I'm not paying for their subscription.
 So is there anything out there that I can use to monitor and keep statistics on the web traffic?
 It would be cool to see what subdomains are getting hit the most, or how many GET, POST, etc requests are being made, and potentially seeing what is being exploited.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've dipped into the world of selfhosted services a few times before but never had a deeper need to selfhost applications for a larger audience in a semi-professional environment.
 Nontheless, now I want to offer a cost-efficient solution for planning and streamlining communication on a project for 10-25 people. Concurrent access of all users is very unlikely. at most 5-10 people will use the services regularily at any given time
 Nothing's set in stone so far except for software. Drive space requirement > 500GB
 I'd like to use 
  
OpenProject (used on a Synology DS via Docker before) for project management and scheduling of tasks
 
Nextcloud for file sharing (integrated in OP)
 
synapse / matrix to channel user available chat apps on one single platform.
 
 I have three options for hardware:
  
Synology DS with an Atom C3853, 32GB ECC RAM (but slow internet access)
 
Intel NUC with Celeron J4005, 4GB of DDR4 (can be upgraded to 8GB and relocated for faster internet access)
 
or investing ~400$ in a new Odroid H3 / H3+ , 16GB RAM and 2 SSDs for RAID 1 (moved somewhere else for fast internet)
 
 All services must run through a VPN tunnel, so a VPN server would have to be hosted on the machine, too.
  
The cheapest and easiest solution is def using the NUC but I am not sure whether the J4005 can manage at least those 3 services within docker / portainer.
 
The Synology has a faster CPU and tons of RAM and HDD space but cannot be relocated somewhere else for faster internet.
 
The Odroid H3 / H3+ has by far the best CPU and offers M.2 and 2x SATA for internal Raid 1 but means a bigger investment.
 
 What would you recommend and why?
 Thank you!

 Hello, there, I’m searching for some advise, I’m a Mac user with some old experience in Windows too, So I’m able to install normal OS without much troubles in both. 
 I’m currently use Plex on an old MBP that I have using like a media server and I use remote access to operating it from my new Mac through screen share, so it’s been very flexible and easy for me. 
 But now I have anoter (more old) windows notebook that I could use as a media server. The thing is, if it could run Plex in good condition as how it’s now, or should I install some older version of Windows, or even should I install another dedicated server OS to run my media stuff (video and music) and maybe as a file backup too, but hopefully with an easy remote access tool. Plex is really flexible and simple because I can play my stuff on my chromcast and managing in the web app too.
 So that’s the question, should I keep the windows 10 version and install Plex server, or should I use other OS and/or Media server APP?.
 Thanks in advance :)

 I love this community! Over the past few months I've gone from simply running Plex on my desktop to picking up a r720 and learning Ubuntu server with docker and now rocking Plex/arr's, Seafile and HomeAssistant. I'm now trying to better understand security and best practice while accessing my server remotely. Since you all here are smarter than I, I'm hoping you can point me in the right direction on a couple things.
 ​
 The Goal: VPN out of my workplace, connecting to my server/home network via OpenVPN and sTunnel on port 443. Tailscale, L2TP, etc are all blocked at work.

 Current Setup
  
Currently port forwarding to my server. I don't have a reverse proxy. My knowledge of security is limited hence this post. Maybe this is the better way to do things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me preface this by saying this is my fault for not reading the fine print, not the ebay seller's.
 I bought a set of four 600GB Toshiba AL13SEB600 sas drives to use in an HPE Proliant DL360 G6 server. I didn't read the part of the description that says "these drives are for NetApp Servers", figuring any old 2.5 sas drive would work. Unfortunately all four drives give me the orange 'drive failed' light and don't show up at all in the P410i raid card config menu. I know the slots and raid card are good, since the original 72GB drives still work fine. So it seems that the seller was right that they can only be used in a NetApp server (or they're broken, which I have no way of knowing). The thing is, I'm pretty sure from the datasheet that these are not special drives or anything, they should be regular old sas drives.
 Edit: I forgot to mention, the DL360 G6 datasheet does say that the server can handle a maximum of 4TB (8x500GB) storage, but I don't think that's the problem, since I've connected over 5TB of mixed drives, including one 3TB drive, and it's functioned without issue.
 Which leads me to my question. How could drives be configured in such a way that they work on one system (netapp), but completely fail at the hardware level in another (HP)? Beyond that, how can I reformat them to work in my HP server (assuming they're actually functional)?
 Sorry if this is a dumb question, I'm very new to enterprise type stuff and I didn't see anything helpful in my quick googling.

However i specified to run the docker container as specific PID and GID so that every file that has permission with given PID and GID will be transfered to docker container's environment with it's internal set of ownerships.
 However, when my friend add file to the binded folder of docker container, he have the ownership so inside docker container, the permissions will be shown as (eg.) 1002 and 1002.
 So i would need to tell the docker container to accept files from multiple UIDs and GIDs and so make it owned by internal set of ownerships. Can i simply just put 1001,1002,1003 inside the UID environment variable? (I don't think so)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: I shoot a lot of 16mm cinema film, and the telecine files I get are huge. A 100' reel at 24fps gives you about 2.5 minutes of footage. My telecine files for that 2.5 minute reel are typically about 85GB (6.5k resolution, HDR). As one does with analog film, long term preservation of the film itself and the original telecine files is important. I'm looking to burn these video files to BDXL MDISC and keep them offsite, to help support the 3-2-1 rule.
 Question: What is the best type of marker to use when labeling discs for long term archival storage? I know Sharpies are a no-no because they fade with time, but how about something like a Sakura Pigma Micron Pen, since they claim to be pigment based and archival in nature. Is something like that chemically safe to use with the MDISC without threat of damaging the disc over a long period of time?
 What do you recommend one uses?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I just recently started getting serious about self hosting and trying to learn as much as possible in the process.
 As stated in the title, I generated SSL certificates for my domain for my self hosted web server. I did this about a year ago, and it was great.
 I just moved this webserver to something more stable and when generating the SSL certificate I expected having to revoke the old one or something of the sort (maybe having to copy the old ones to the new server). But nope, let's encrypt just let me request a certificate with no issues. Is this normal?
 What is preventing someone else from creating a certificate for my website?
 I am perhaps misunderstanding the goal of the certificates.
 Any pointers or guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated!

 It seems like my only option is either an external HDD with power supply and 3.5 (Will make it a CMR one), or an SSD. I know the shortcomings of QLC flash, but I usually use my HDD as Quasi WORM and do far more reads than writes unless I'm adding data. And do the 3-2-1 (well actually 4-3-2-1) backup rule including to WORM media. So it looks like the Samsung QVO is my only option along with its expensive (but still reasonable compared to years ago) price tag. Are there any alternatives?
 Adding in CFS so needing light travel packs when possible, it seems a 2.5 SSD will be my best option

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 6 months ago I went through the (in my opinion) painstaking process of setting up backing up my personal NAS to BackBlaze B2. Ensuring that everything was backed up and properly syncing every day took some time but ultimately I was happy it was automated and working. In these 6 months, I've never had to use it in a real data-loss scenario.
 Until this/last month. For my local setup, I run Windows with StableBit's DrivePool with data duplication enabled. While DrivePool is not a backup, it is a tool that should help me in a drive failure scenario. What it wasn't configured for was what happens when 2 drives happen to die at the same time. Over the course of about a week I noticed my server getting slower and slower to respond, to the point where the system would lock up until I turned…]]></summary>

 I have an Unraid server and within it a folder where I back up all my photos.
 These are photos that I initially edit in Lightroom in my computer. I store them into year folders, and then it time-sorted subfolders. So the structure looks like this:
 2019 --1 Paris --2 London --3 Helsinki 2020 --1 Edinburgh --2 Lyon --3 Hamburg --4 Stockholm --5 Garden party at John's 2021 --1 Mary's wedding --2 Camping trip --3 National History Museum

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every time I set up any technology (Home Assistant, Automation, Networking, etc...) I research and learn about it and set it up. Then a year or two later when it comes to upgrading or troubleshooting I have forgotten how to use any of it. I don't remember where I found the guides that helped me set it up in the first place.
 So I started keeping notes about anything that I set up in a Google document. This has already saved my bacon several times but the document is getting a bit unorganized. I'm wondering if a Wiki may be better suited to keep all of this organized? Here are a few things I'd be looking for:
 ​
  
Some sort of first page "Table of Contents" feature that shows all of the topics and subtopics. Since this is rather focused I don't want to use search functions to find my entries.
 Very strong formatting options (especially headers, styling, and tables)
 Good screenshot/image support (including being able to see the original size)
 Easy to use on desktop and mobile.
 I will mostly use this just myself. However, it would be a bonus if I could give access to certain sections of my wiki to other users. I rent out my home when I'm traveling and would love to give access to certain sections to my manager so he can fix things while I'm away.
  
​
 In general do you guys think a Wiki engine would be good for something like this? And if so do you have any recommendations based on my requirements? 
 Really excited to learn more about this!

 Using the integrated file system of macOS is one option, but it is hard having an overview of all documents. I know Bento for Mac was a thing but it seems that it is no longer developed. Is there any software like Bento who still exists ? A place where you can store all notes, documents, and emails in one place ??

 During my self-hosted journey, I had many doubts about how to do it the best way. I was curious how other people have made theirs, so I created this survey.

I think it will be really interesting to see what's most common. Here it is: https://forms.gle/XGdeW3f8WZc1hwtx9

 Im certain there are plenty self hosted Calenders out there, but Im a pretty visual person, I need a decent interface. Which is why I love stuff like Plex, Bitwarden, Pihole, they all have great Webinterfaces.
 And as I mentioned with my phone, it would need to be able to sync across devices. Wether or not that happens in realtime over a constant sync, or only once im home over Wifi in the local network doesnt matter too much.

This website (NSFW, contains nonsexual nudes) has a few thousand images but I can't quite figure out how to download in bulk from it. I've tried WFDownloader and JDownloader, but I'm relatively new to using these tools so maybe I'm missing something. Anyone have any ideas or other programs I can try out? 
 You can have it load in a new photo every second in a slideshow format by using http://reference.sketchdaily.net/en/view/FullBodies?Time=1 that link but I'm not sure how useful that is, as even if I could capture each photo it'd still take over half an hour to sift through everything.

I'm trying to find a 16 3.5" HDD DAS case and if i could do some minor modifications to put 8 cages in this case I would be thrilled. It looks like the type B cages can mount to 120MM fan mounts and there are 4 at the top of the case. I can easily drill some extra holes in the cages unless you guys have something similar that allows stacking. Also with 4 fans up front and 2 fans in the rear I don't think air flow and drive temps would be an issue at all.
 Edit: I should point out this will not have a motherboard. Just HDDs, Cages, two SFF-8088 to SFF- 8087 adapters and a power supply. 
 Edit 2: Added a picture of what I think might work from the top down. The red boxes are the Type-B Cages.

 My requirements:
  
Works with existing filesystem, ideally read-only; does not impose its own structure. Since multiple people use this NAS, photos are not neatly rooted in one "photos" folder, but spread across the filesystem. I'm fine with having to manually navigate to those folders, though.

 I'm running Proxmox, and so far have Home Assistant OS and MineOS currently running in their own VMs. The only other thing I wanted to do is install pfSense to use as a router/firewall for our network. Would this system be able to handle all of this? I'm looking at going up to 32gb of RAM, but are four cores/eight threads enough for all of those things? I just want to make sure any of those VMs wouldnt be bogged down by the other. 
 Currently, MineOS has 2 cores and 8GB RAM, HA has 2 cores and 4GB RAM. I was going to do 1 core for pfSense and 1-2GB RAM. The Minecraft server is mostly idle except for maybe one night a week when my buddies and I get on, which is usually at most five of us. HA doesnt ever seem to use much CPU.
 I'm looking at NICs and am looking at Intel ones since I know theyre a bit better and require lower CPU usage. We have 500mbps internet and may upgrade at some point to gigabit. 
 I'm new to this all, so any help is much appreciated. Thank you so much

 Highly recommended. Considered getting some for the price, but I already have spares.

 These are the prices they were several years ago before the USB-C models came out and the price jumped, partially because of product confusion between the old and new models.

 ​
 I'm waiting for an S-VHS to transfer via S-Video however I read that the Elgato software isn't giving me the best digital copy.
 ​
 What is the best software/steps to use to convert the VHS to digital? vDub? Something else? 
 ​
 What format should I be using? H.264/265?
 ​
 Any advice greatly appreciated. I'm completely new to this but I'm a fast learner.
 Thanks!

 That led me on a quest to do it right so today we installed 2 x 20A 120V circuits to the area my server rack lives in. 
 I’ll never need that much power but I can pull 2000 watts if I have all of my servers and gaming PC going at the same time. 
 I’ll also have one outlet open after installing the 3rd UPS in the rack for things like a soldering iron or heat gun that I use on occasion. 
 Now I can sleep better at night.

 If I were to order 744-A2166 from CDW, does it come with the cable and connector? Or will I find out that I'm suppose to transfer over the wires and connector? 
 If it doesn't include the cable/connector, which connector is this called?

 is there any good way on how I could monitor my HDD health (hours, bad blocks, pending sectors) ?
 I know that there are some tools which can check this, but I am looking for something that would do it automatically and if something was wrong it would unmount that drive, or it would for example send notification.
 Currently I would use DietPi, and something in docker would be a welcome addition. But in future I hope I can build some proper NAS which would do this in it's software (like truenas or something like that).
 Thanks

 I've been working on a small project that sorts out your Plex theme.mp3 files, especially for movies on Plex where theme songs aren't sourced from Plex. Rather than using obscure bash scripts, and having to copy them manually whenever Radarr/Sonarr upgrades a file (because for some reason, they can't just leave them untouched), this script keeps all your theme songs in one folder, and then symlinks them out to your media.
 Here's my quite boring blog post on it (with a nifty tutorial including bad humour), the Github repo lives here, and the crate for the project is probably here. (When I get enough time, I'll work on building the binaries using GH Actions, but I haven't had the chance to yet)

 now the issue is when i enable content switching neither of the two servers that are set up and running are visible but when content switching is off it only lets you connect to the first server on either sub domains ive set for each. 
 is this a issue with kemp and if so is there any alternatives i can use or just a issue with minecraft hosting

 I have, for the past few months making a list of singers and bands whose entire discographies I wish to download. At the moment I have around 2100 artists. The way I was going to go about this was as follows:
  
Download the music videos
  Download each listed album in the playlists tab and sort them out by album in folders
  
This seemed like a great idea until I did the math and realized that this would require downloading around 30,000 albums each individually.
 Is there a better way to do this? I still want albums to be sorted into their own folder each.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently started getting into self hosting in order to use services like nextcloud. I just found out that my ISP is using NAT for every home connection (aka no public IPv4 address), which means I can't use Dynamic DNS to point my domain at my router's IPv4 address. A static IPv4 address would solve the issue but costs an additional 5€ per month.
 My ISP does assign a public IPv6 address, so now I'm thinking I could use that instead. Would this public IPv6 address be static our would I need to use Dynamic DNS here as well?
 Does anyone have experience with this? I know only the basics of IPv6. Can my router translate internal IPv4 traffic to the public IPv6 address or do I need to change all my internal addresses to IPv6 as well?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to expand my homelab but am running low on physical space to put servers in where noise is acceptable. My first thought was my crawl space, but there are a few problems which need to be overcome to pull this off like temperature and humidity control, access restrictions and cabeling.
 Cabeling for me is easy since the breaker panel and switching is right above it and just need new cables.
 The crawl space is hard to access but having some redundancy in disks and IPMI control on my servers will help out a lot since I don't need to access it daily anyway.
 But the last big problem is temperature and humidity control. I placed a sensor which measures that and logged it for 5 months. In peak summer it never went above 24 degrees and now in autumn it did not went below 18. This is good since it is never too hot and hopefully not too cold even in freezing weather. There are also ventilation holes in case the lab produces too much heat.
 But the humidity! It never went below 95% relative humidity in the summer and in the last month 100%. I read trough the manuals of the hardware I have and it is all rated for below 90%. Hard drives won't be a problem since they are helium sealed. 
 So I think this won't be such a problem because humidity only condenses on cold surfaces and servers inherently get warm. Along with the heat it all produces it might push the relative humidity down and not be such a problem.
 I might also put a fan against the exhaust vents in case it gets really bad but I'd rather not because that will definitely screw with the house's isolation since crawl spaces are for isolation of the house.
 Has anyone experience with a setup like this?
 location is the Netherlands btw. house is below water level but water never occurs in the space, it is just really humid

My setup is 3 8TB HDD's, a 512 gb SSD for the OS, and a 256 gb NVME for cache. I plan on adding 2 more 8tb drives in the near future. My use case for this will be a Plex server with a few Docker containers and a small SMB share. Unraid seems to be a great option, with the ability to expand your pools later on. While TrueNAS has ZFS and you don't have to have a USB as a critical part of your system. The downside is I would not be able to add the drives to a ZFS pool when I purchase them down the line. I really like the idea of using Unraid but the USB thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I think about it. I've read some comparison articles but none of them have been able to sway me in either direction. I appreciate any help you can offer or guidance towards the correct decision.

 Samsung 850 Pro - 512GB (10.5 yrs)
 Samsung 850 Pro - 1TB (10.5 yrs)
 Samsung 850 Pro - 1TB (10.5 yrs)

They are now averaging almost 10 yrs in age. Should these just be preemptively replaced at this point? Cost is about $600 if using Samsung 870 EVO 1TB or 2TB replacements . 
 They don't fail the same way that HDD's do which is why I haven't bothered until now but 10 yrs sounds a bit too long.

I tested all the parts and they all work correctly. The vhs player plays the tap back correctly on tv, capture card can display the vhs play fine. Its just when the I capture. Is this a tbc problem? The JVC HR-9500U I have has a time corrector in it and I had sure it was on but still have the problem. Do I have to get another tbc? Attached in this post is a test tape i am using to get all the kinks out before i get the family tapes.
 Edit: would help if I added the video

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm new to Cloudflare tunnels.
 I'm trying to set a single tunel for *.home.domain.com
 Most tutorials I see are creating a tunnel per service or add multiple public hostnames to a single tunnel. I don't really want to manage each service in Cloudflare and would rather have a single tunnel that points to my local reverse proxy which will then handle all the traffic dispatching since it already does for local network traffic.
 I tried numerous things but nothing works as I would like.
 All I was able to achieve at some point was to have a working service1.domain.com -- yet not even service1.home.domain.com -- but as I said that's not what I want.
 Any ideas ?
 Thank you

 The thing is I want to have the possibility to migrate a container to another hostsystem without changing the services local ip. (which would not be possible if the container uses the vms ip) 
 Whats the best way to do this/ Give every container its own ip adress? (also preferable its own nic with Mac adress that the change is auto picked up by pfsense)

 Both are in the same network and I can open the gotify page but can't login. login works when directly accessing the page. Its a clean install. I pasted the config from there docs, but then I get an error about self signed certs. Can someone help to configure NPM? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear selfhosted subreddit,
 I have a personal production server (Hetzner instance) to which I deploy my software almost exclusively with docker compose, including my Traefik reverse proxy and machine monitoring setup. I've setup a github ci/cd which:
  
is triggered on a push on a repository main branch
 connects to my instance with ansible
 updates the repo locally
 builds services over there on the server with docker compose
 deploys them with docker compose as well
  
The setup is working currently with not much issues, I guess. But my question is:
 Can I do better?
 I think I want to decouple the build and the deploy stage (eg build with github actions, push them on a registry and pull them onto the VPS) but I've researched the Internets and found nothing satisfactory for the automated deployment, except for doing that from within my ansible action.
 What I am imagining is something along the lines of Argo CD or watchtower but for docker compose, which knows when my containers are updated but also knows how to connect them to networks and volumes I've defined for them.
 Please share your ideas :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, you read that correctly. The goal is to archive large parts of Discord.
 ​
 Why?
 It is important to archive a platform like Discord. Discord has replaced forums as a platform for exchanging information on specific topics. These forums are fortunately largely covered by e.g. the Wayback-Machine. The problem is that Discord is quite closed and can't be easily archived.
 ​
 How can the whole thing be done?
 Me and a friend have thought about something. We have developed a website and a discord bot. Every server admin can index his server with the bot. On Search-Cord.com you can search all messages in a few milliseconds. The usernames no longer contain #tags so that no users can be contacted against their will.
 The current state:
 Currently we have about 20 servers with a total of about 3 million messages archived?
 ​
 What about opensource?
 The complete source code can be found on Github.
 What if someone does not want their messages to be in the archive?
 On the website you can autentify yourself with discord and then delete all messages from the archive and put yourself on a blacklist to prevent future messages from being archived.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for alternatives to Minio, to host a S3-compatible object storage service in my network.
 Although I love Minio and it works great and I’ve used it for years, I recently needed it for a different project and noticed that when Minio is running, it prevents the hard drives used to store its data from spinning down. Sadly this is a deal-breaker for me as this server is used very infrequently and spinning the disks down is very useful to me.
 I don’t need any “fancy” requirement: no dashboard, HA, replication, advanced permissions, or really support for any operation besides getting/putting objects. Something simple and lightweight would do the trick just fine.
 Any recommendation?

 ​
 Various research later and I seem to find answers suggesting that it's possible, such as this post. However, I've been struggling to find any actual guides to get it setup (or at least guides simple enough for me).
 A couple of notes:
  
all my services are running inside docker containers

 I also took the liberty of making certain my cable modem and router were also on the UPS—and the PoE switch too of course.
 Today, for the first time in a long time, the power went out—and guess who still had Internet access for all their battery-powered wireless devices because the Wireless Access Points use PoE? Me ;) . It was bliss and everyone was so happy!
 (While I had originally tested a power outage scenario by shutting off the breaker when I deployed the UPS, there was no way for me to actually test what would happen with the Internet cable connection head end when the power went out in the neighborhood. That was, at least, until today.)
 Another win (and justification?) for our homelabs!

 I don’t necessarily need a free solution. For example I could buy 66Analytics if it is the best one, but I simply don’t know which one to choose.
 Last question: some do not use cookies, so it isn’t necessary to have a cookies pop up on your site?

 I believe the issue has to do with PostgreSQL 15's new security features?
 I mainly plan on using this database with Nextcloud alone, for now. So, 1 app = 1 instance of a database.
 I don't need extreme hand-holding, but, does anyone know what commands I can use to allow me to bypass this new error from NextCloud when setting up my service for the first time?: Error while trying to initialise the database: An exception occurred while executing a query: SQLSTATE[42501]: Insufficient privilege: 7 ERROR: permission denied for schema public LINE 1: CREATE TABLE oc_migrations (app VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL, versi...

Anyways I can't find any non shady looking sellers on Newegg but I'm looking to get 6 SAS 3.5 HDDs. I'd like to get as much storage as possible for less than $150 per drive. Any recommendations ? If I have to choose between reliability vs storage size I'll choose reliability every time. I appreciate any recommendations you can give.

I tried to serve my movies and shows on the laptop and it does work but the thing is, the service I used (Jellyfin) was trying to process the video before playing it.
 I wanted to make a server that just works kinda deal. I am ready to manually encode the videos into some sort of type that runs directly without processing but I don't want to wait for the video to load. Is it possible? Is there any service that allows video hosting without much server load?
 I am basically a new born when it comes to self hosting by the way, I just saw a couple tutorials online and used a debian server with docker to set up Jellyfin.

 I'm quite newbie when it comes to networking and I need some help getting free reliable tools for the following:
 I need: Real-time Network Monitoring Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
 I would like a GUI that allows me to check which device (IP) is slowing down the network. Or just be able to know and see more clearly what is happening, on the fly.
 Sometimes internet might get slow and I'm completely blind, not knowing if it is an internal or external problem. 
 I do have 2 proxmox servers, I also have Kali Linux fully updated with all it's stuff, but I still don't know exactly how I can use it. 
 Thanks in advance.

 TLDR: can you fake domain resolution to specific IP of reverse proxy ? i.e. with hosts file ?
 ​
  
Hey everyone 
 So I recently had an epiphany and I hope you can help me to answer the uncertainty it has raised. 
 I use single traefik, with own public domain, for public and private dns names, both under same domain, as subdomain records. The only difference is that what should be public is on public dns (cloudflare) and what should not be accessible from internet, is on my lan dns (Adguard in my case). And traefik having dns challenge wildcard certs for my domain. 
 But what happens when someone finds out my public IP, and adds to their host file my ip and my(or try random) "private" dns record. Will it request from traefik my supposedly private url/page but from public internet? Since traefik servers those subdomains and it doesn't care where request came from? I have even seen you can request a specific IP while requesting dns name with curl too. 
 So from security point of view, is it possible to access your apparently "private" dns records using this method ? 
 If yes, what is the best practice to separate public/private records under same public domain ? Use two traefik instances, or I have been looking for source IP restrictions for those private/lan requests ?
  
​
 Unfortunately haven't got much responses at r/Traefik, let's see what you think :)

 When you take into consideration, their read/write speeds cap at roughly 530MB/sec and the prices and performance of M.2 NVMe or the cheap TB Price of HDD ($13-15/TB) they have to be of the worse values out there for storage.
 Is it because they can fit laptops due to their 2.5" form factor?

 It can be free (as long as it's still maintained). It can be paid (as long as there's a self hosted option).

 I have been searching for like 2 weeks and it really shouldn't be so incredibly hard... Does anyone know a 3 or 4u case that meets the following requirements:
 - Redundant PSU
 - Can add multiple Noctua Fans
 - Supports EATX Motherboard
 ​
 I would think these incredibly basic requirements would be easy but wow... I think I am going to have to just go with a SuperMicro SC846 but wanted to try and find something that wasn't just a NAS chassis converted to a high airflow system using a 3rd printed front-mounted fan mount.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For folks who don't know, Drobo is a NAS type device which creates redundant storage from a bunch of disks, but the key thing is that the disks don't need to match in size. In fact, to increase the size of the storage, you can replace the drives one at time and let it rebuild between each swap, and soon enough you'll have increased the size of array.
 My question is, is there any way i can implement this without a drobo? I've got a pile of mismatched 2.5" drives which on their own are next to useless, but as part an array they could have quite a bit more life.
 For reference, I'm thinking about a case like this:

 The volumes are NFS. And just changing the path results in error because the destination folder doesn't exist.

 I don’t mind noise, so long as they have the 6 gig backplane, and can easily handle SATA drives. The product listing says “SATA drives require interposer cards (optional)” and that has me a bit concerned. 
 The price seems right, but I would appreciate some advice.
 Edit: these appear to have a 10 gig NIC, but the documentation specifically says “for interconnect”. Does this mean it’s not a normal NIC I can put an IP on?

 I'm in the UK, electricity costs started spiralling about 5-6 months, the government has basically borrowed a crazy amount of money to subsidise consumer electricity costs. From what I can tell, this has allowed it to be capped at £0.34 per KwH ($0.39 for folks in the US), which is still insanely high, and nobody knows where it will be in a year or so!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My father was a big time record collector. He would literally skip meals for most of a week to have cash to buy a new vinyl record, as my mother tells it. He passed about 15 years ago, so his collection has sat dormant for awite awhile. One of his last gifts he got was a USB turntable. My brother doesn't want the records and I don't have the physical space. It seems that growing this collection was kind of his life mission. He would refer to anything non vinyl as "Inferior music."
 My goal for now is to get his USB turntable, and rip every single album, so my brother and I can have our own little piece of the music my father sacrificed so much to afford. This will be a nightmare project. I ballpark at least 100 albums, and I'd be thoroughly unsurprised if it was closer to 200, and at a very conservative 30 minutes, that's 50 hours of ripping, at minimum. If I do this, I want to do this ONCE. I replace my hard drives every 4 years, and I know USB drives and SD/Micro SD are famous for short lifespans, so I'm looking for something we could keep for as long as possible. I'm not looking for huge storage capacity. Ripping direct WAV files, this should easily take up less than a TB. I want to be certain we could play these for as long as possible though. My brother isn't into music, and the music he is into he'll just go to YouTube for. I have no doubt he'll take the thing storing the music, throw it in a safe, and it'll never see the light of day again. Another reason that having a long term format is very important. It's going to sit there for a very, very long time.
 I'm considering Blu Ray-R discs, but there's probably something better for this task. I also don't have a Blu Ray drive, so that would add minimum $100 to the project. To those who are more informed about storage than me, any advice? What would you do in my shoes? Thanks to anyone who can help me

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the process of finishing my laundry renovation and finally have a place for my gear that isn't in the corner of a bedroom or living room. 
 testing in progress
 While trying to migrate my unraid server from a full size tower to a HP prodesk G5 I was having issues getting the necessary bios changes to stick to allow the HP to boot from the unraid USB. I found every time I unpowered it to move it the settings reset for some reason. 
 I needed to change them in-place. I didn't have any long display port cables so needed to bring my monitor in from another room. The only place I could sit it within reach of the prodesk was on the drawer that sits in between my stacked washer and dryer. Hail the Electrolux STA9GW, the true powerhouse of my setup. 
 Now I know many will be concerned with the proximity to a dryer. I am too, but my plan is to have a fan draw air into the cabinet from the side, away from the dryer. I also intentionally bought a heat pump dryer meaning not much heat or moisture actually enters the room. Very happy to get feedback though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So when I set up my old Dell PowerEdge R520 running RockyLinux 9 I did not have enough hard drives to create a mirrored zpool using ZFS. Currently, I have 2 3tb drives, 2 8tb drives, and 2 14tb drives (28.6tb used out of 45.2tb). I want to create a mirrored ZFS zpool consisting of 4 8tb drives and 4 14tb drives but unsure of what to do to set that up without wiping the current unmirrored zpool and loosing all of my data. What sort of options do I have? The only ones I can think of are:
  
Is there a way to remove the 2 3tb drives from the unmirrored zpool 
 Install 2 14tb drives and 2 8tb drives
 Set them up with RAID
 Transfer data from the unmirrored zpool
 Add the drives to the new mirrored zpool
 
 Offload the data from the unmirrored zpool to another set of drives 
 Delete the unmirrored zpool and create a mirrored one with the drives I want.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to come up with something similar to those expensive DAS units that I can configure myself.
 I found a unit that even used BTRFS, but I would assume their "gui" wouldn't include the same level of features as accessing the drives themselves.
 So, I wonder what options are available to build an external DAS unit that works over usb 3.2 and or thunderbolt 3/4?
 ​
 Alternatively, an external drive enclosure that supports raid 1+0?
 Also, would you recommend if going the enclosure route that I have an extra external drive to keep important files safe?
 ​
 What are your experiences with roadwarrior style for managing storage?
 I'll have a large lithium battery to run this, plugged into the 12v on a vehicle. I don't need much storage on the go, but I'd like to be able to keep VM backups and storage for video/photos local.
 I'm also likely to have the option for remote VMs, but this is a road I've yet to cross.

 I have a physical router connected to a server that runs Proxmox. I wanted to switch to an OPNsense as a VM. Everything worked fine until I added another bridge which I deleted by now. I didn't touch any of the existing bridges. This is my Proxmox network configI cannot reach my PVE from my OPNsense any more. My physical router has the IP 192.168.222.1 and within this subnet Proxmox is reachable under 192.168.222.16. OPNsense has 10.111.0.254. I connected all the networks you can see to the OPNsense except for the 192.168.222.0/24 (vmbr0). Right now no machine that has the OPNsense as gateway and not even the OPNsense itself can reach my PVE under 10.111.0.16 (this was possible before I created more bridges in PVE)
 In my other post I stated that I ruled out the firewall but if you would like to see the configuration I can post what you need to see. Do you have any idea what could have gone wrong?

I have access to good office printers, so scanning most of the standard documents was a breeze. But I'm having issues with larger format documents. Especially paper rolls (so about 3-4m x 80cm wide), but also larger DIN A0 documents (e.g. Blueprints, plans, family trees, posters, etc.). I checked local services, but they can only handle DIN formats, but not the rolls. Do you guys have any ideas on how I could digitize them in somewhat good quality? I was thinking of taking lots of photos and stitching them with photomerge in Photoshop, but that failed quite badly. Are there maybe some scanner apps specialized for this, or are there any other techniques than I'm missing? Thanks for any help in advance!

 While OpenVPN user config file solved my selective (use this under vpn use this under ISP) problem.
 I was still facing the HTTPS bitwarden issue (you cannot use HTTP), but self signed certs seemed like such a pain in the ass to manage and get into, when I stumbled upon dnsmasq, and oh boy, did this transform my setup. (using Nginx proxy manage as well though)
 Choose any domain for your internal service, access it from any device anywhere while using OpenVPN (or I guess VPN'esque protocol of your choice), its like the time I discovered docker for the first time.
 So the question is, is everybody using it by default, or is it not being talked about enough?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I do regular backups of all of my devices, cards, and external drives, which a lot of the times includes tens of gigabytes of video footage (I do freelance videography work). I know I could most likely just delete all this footage after but as data hoarders understand, we would rather have a thorough archive of what we've shot, even if we'll never use the footage again.
 I've recently started using Handbrake to compress some of my archived footage which has been great - I have projects that had over 100GB of video footage in them and compressing the video files has literally halved the amount of storage space needed for those files. The only downside is, the compressed files are brand new files and the old still exist. So the only way I can actually benefit from this system is if I delete the old files, which I'm hesitant to do since those original files have all the "created at", "modified at", and other data associated with the actual original creation.
 What I'd love to be able to do is use some kind of tool or process to be able to delete these files but automatically replace them with a little data file that contains all that info. That way if I go looking for the files someday in the future and I navigate to the directory I know they should be in, I can see the files that were there plus all the original data from them, but it's just like a .txt file or something like that but which has the same name as the original file (different extension though obviously).
 Is anyone aware of something that does this or a workflow I could use to do it manually but in bulk? Any thoughts anyone has would be greatly appreciated! Cheers 
 EDIT: Forgot to mention, I have both MacOS and Windows machines but usually my backup processes take place on Windows so looking for preferably a tool/process for Windows, but can make Mac work as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi people!
 I have a home server and a couple of laptops, and I want to periodically backup my home folders from the laptops to my home server. They're in the same network.
 The home server has a zfs array, so the first thing that came to mind was to just have a systemd timer on the laptops that rsyncs (with --delete) the home folder into a folder on the home server, and another script + timer on the server that zfs snapshots that folder, maybe cleans up snapshots older than 30 days or so. But all this seems pretty low tech.
 Is there an established solution for something like this? I'd essentially like an automated backup with snapshots for last ~30 days. Or if you have some other backup scheme you deem superior, please share it with me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What sorts of data do you guys hoard? Statistics? Prices? Web scraping? 
 The reason I ask is because I want to start my own collection lab with a simple raspberry pi and mount it to some hard drives, but I’m not sure where to start or where to get real time data or if I’m looking in the wrong place. 
 Do you use premade software or make your own for these collections? What format of storage do you use and in what cases? What situational data do you include? Time of day? Temperature? Do you simply extrapolate afterwards?
 These are all things that can be done by me, and is likely a personal preference, but I’d love to hear what you guys think would be cool.

 What thought of speeds can be expected from pairing this enclosure with M.2 NVMe assuming its connected to the proper USB port. 
 At first hand it seems a bit of an absurdity but assuming a spare M.2 NVMe does it make sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had this working before so I have no idea why its not working now, but here's my situation:
 I just upgraded my server and would like to try Nextcloud again as it was pretty clunky before. I'm running Unraid, and I install Nextcloud (it doesn't matter which container, its all of them this happens with) with its own IP address (also tried on host net).
 I configured a HAProxy backend/frontend entry, same way I always do like the 30 other services I have, and the same way I did before when Nextcloud worked with HAProxy. Then, I have Pi-Hole running as my main DNS, so I enter my domain "nextcloud.example.com" in there and point it at HAProxy's virtual IP, same as the other 30 entries.
 When attempting to visit the address "https://nextcloud.example.com" I receive the following error: 503 Service Unavailable | The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS port
 I have tried directing HAProxy backend entry to both the HTTP and HTTPS ports and tried with SSL on and off, still receive this same message. Happens with every. single. Nextcloud docker container. I have not had this issue before, and the last time I played around with Nextcloud before the upgrade was about 6-9 months ago.
 Can anyone advise what I might be doing wrong? What I might be able to change? Or, if I am asking in the wrong place where I might be able to go to request assistance for this?
 Thank you in advance!

 I've also read that ECC RAM may be benefitial for this, not really sure how, since I'm ignorant on the subject of NAS & ECC.

 Question: Anyone have a recommendation (or maybe even one laying around) for a stupidly basic, low power, PCIe graphics card with VGA out, and preferably fan-less? I would be passing it through to probably a Debian VM. All I'm looking to get out of it is the ability to run a desktop on a monitor in my server rack and display a Grafana output. Is there anything with less capable cards that would make them a bad candidate for GPU pass-through? 
 Alternative option could possibly be a USB3.0 PCIe card with a USB to VGA adapter.
 I have a gigabyte GV-N210D3-1GI laying around that ill try testing with, but it's probably more capable than i need.

All devices continue to work without issue during power flickers (PCs, Monitors, Proxmox Cluster, NAS) but my core switch in the basement will reboot. I'm wondering if it's a load issue on the UPS or if it's not of high enough quality to handle the load when switching over for that 1 second.
 The UPS is a CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD 1500VA/900W with ~450W loadThe switch is a Brocade/Ruckus ICX 6610 with both psu's plugged in.Other devices on the UPS is 3x Lenovo Tiny and a DIY NAS running TrueNAS.All 5 of these devices are on a CyberPower PDU.
 ​
 Edit: Thanks for the responses. I believe the issue is the switch is just sensitive to the ups being line interactive.

Plex/Jellyfin client
 web browser or wine (for TV-based Kindle & eBook reading)
 Bluetooth connectivity
 Ethernet/Wi-Fi (ideally Ethernet, even though that level of connectivity wouldn't really be necessary)
  
Would this be something that just a Pi Zero could handle? or would it require something more robust?

 I'd like to know if someone could help me, knowing that : - english is not my mother language - my network knowledge are really low level ^
 I recently got a fiber connexion at home with a Livebox (Orange ISP router). It cannot get a static public IP unfortunatly. 
 I own an Unraid NAS with all the *arr apps / plex / navidrome / etc... And I would like to be able to reach them easily. With my previous provider I had a static IP address, had bought a domain name (ovh) and I was able to get swag running on the NAS in order to reach my services as this :
 radarr.mydomain.ovh sonarr.mydomain.ovh ......
 What would be the best way to achieve it now that I have a dynamic IP ? As a noob, I think I need to get almost all steps not just "use no-ip and configure your router as needed" 😅
 Thanks for reading !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been wanting to do something like this for a while. Canonical has their Anbox platform to run android apps in Linux (like BlueStacks, etc). They also have Anbox Cloud that's only available to enterprise customers. Cloud let's you stream apps to your phone as though they're installed on your phone and not the cloud. 
 I'd love to do something similar, self-hosted and open source. Especially with 5G, the phone can transmit data plenty fast enough. 
 There's absolutely no need for me to have an app forced upon me every time I visit a website. No Express, I don't need your app to track me, I just need clothes. There's really very few apps that are actually worthy of hogging up memory on my phone (with no expandable storage). 
 I'd love to shove work apps (Outlook, etc) off to the cloud and off my phone, etc. 
 Any solutions out there like Anbox Cloud?
 Edit: I found a FOSS software called KDE Connect in the Play Store." I haven't tried it yet, but it looks like it could at least get the job done for the time being and be a good launching point to build something dedicated for this purpose

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello datahoarders!
 I've been a lurker here for a while, and I really appreciate the informative community here. I recently purchased a Mac mini M1 with 256GB internal space and 16GB of ram, and I'm looking to use it for school, music production and leisure - it will be my main desktop. Therefore, I am in need of some storage. My question to you all is, how much do I realistically need to invest in to future proof myself? I know this is subjective, so I've conjured up some rough estimates of how much storage I'd need for the different purposes, based on previous experiences and future wants to give you a better understanding, I suppose. Here they are:
 ​
 I'm thinking of getting an SSD (Samsung T7) with 2TB:
 ~300GB of Music Project Files on Logic Pro X and Ableton Live
 ~1TB of Audio Plugins / Instrument Libraries
 That's ~700GB to spare for other activities and such
 ​
 I'll also get an HDD for things that don't require a high read/write speed (I think?), my original idea was a 10TB WD Elements External Hard drive:
 ~2TB of TV-Shows
 ~1TB of Movies
 ~500GB of Music rips (from online purchases AND ripping my Vinyl-collection at some point)
 ~300GB of Audiobooks
 ~100GB of Comics
 ~50GB of eBooks
 That's ~6TB to spare, for now
 ​
 Is this a smart way to go about it, or is 6TB wayyyyy too much space to spare? Are there better, or cheaper ways of doing this? I hope these questions are answerable, but I'll happily expand upon anything, if needed.
 Thanks in advance!

How do you guys deal with UPnP on specific games such as Call of Duty. This topic already was posted on the Internet with varying succession rates. My old setup used to have ACLs for a specific PC on the network to enable the ports for CoD. Now, I know this may be a worse setup, but it works. The only problem is multiple devices cannot access the game's servers without a "Strict NAT".
 I would love to know your setups for such challenges and how you solved such issues.

 Normally I wouldn't advocate for putting such an older system into production, but it was sitting in the rack turned off and used to be my production server.
 I've turned it into a Hyper-V host which is now hosting my second domain controller, a Windows 10 VM which is hosting backups, on the bare metal OS is now the Veeam server.
 Overall very happy with how the transition was made as while the T410 will be replaced with a Dell R730XD when I make the investment into the better platform for the 3-9 months which the T410 in service it only took ~$100 in parts to bring it up to serviceability.
 To prepare the T410 for the workload the following upgrades were made:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy everyone, I was hoping to get some suggestions/help with an upgrade I would like to make to my current setup. 
 Right now, its a mess, I have a CM stacker case with 5.25" to 3.5" adapters taking up the front, I don't even have room for the power button, it is inside the case. I am using cheap pcie sata adapters for the extra ports necessary. I use stable-bits drive pool to manage the storage. I like drivepool, I do not like the trouble it is anytime I need to make a storage change, or find a specific drive... its a nightmare.
 so I have a Ryzen 2700x machine I would like to put in its place, but I don't want to rebuild the storage the same way.
 since I have rackspace nearby, I would like to move the 10 or so drives into a hot-swappable rack mount chassis, DAS seems the way to go, so I have been looking at various DAS shelves on ebay. and it fits my budget but I have some questions.
 I figure I would be willing to invest around 500 into this, as with most things, if I can save a couple dollars I am ok with it. what would you invest in?
 how much trouble will I have getting my standard ntfs sata drives to show jbod without destroying the data on them on my windows server? 
 I have been a sysadmin for years, but I am quite unfamiliar with these DAS shelves.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, my mom recently switched ISPs and because of that, Hulu thinks she’s in a different zip code, when she’s literally a block away from me. I’ve spent hours on the phone and live chat but either everyone is too stupid to understand the situation or Hulu doesn’t possess the ability to allow live for two different geographic cable markets. 
 So either me and the rest of our family (10+ people) don’t get to access live local networks or she doesn’t, because Hulu asks her if she wants to change her home location for the Hulu account. If she does, it changes the market for the account and the account then thinks everyone else is in the wrong location. 
 So what I want to do is setup a proxy or VPN on my network and point her firestick to it from her network. 
 Obviously my main concern is security. I’m not a big fan of opening an external port just so my mom can watch local news but.. she’s my mom so..I gotta. 
 Any simple and safe solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks, 
 Need some help with my product knowledge on overhead scanners. I feel like I've dropped into a bit of an enthusiast black hole which is rare on the internet these days. 
 Keeping it simple - opinions fine -
 - why does the Scansnap SV600 still come up in conversations when it's 10 years old? If the product was a success, surely Fujitsu would have released a new version by now? 
 - Is there a current reigning champ for overhead scanners? The SV 600 and CZUR seem to be the main two options, with the rest either a lot less expensive or having some kind of bespoke application that makes the product a little less appealing.
 I just need to be able to scan books and ideally product boxes that sometimes have more useful content than the threadbare instructions inside. 
 Thanks to anyone that can help.

 A couple of years ago I used some bash scripting to download about 11,000 archive films off the BFI website in case they were ever put behind a paywall. They're still available to view on BFI but are all now (and newer ones) currently inaccessible to download (brightcove cdn, not figured out how to get at it yet)
 ​
 It's on DHT but I'm the only seeder and slow upload (~400KB/s) I just noticed some leechers on my Tixati client a while ago so looks like the meta got picked up.
 ​
 Can anyone help seed? You can view/find it here:

 ​
 It will be a slow burn; I calculated at my upload speed it would take about 2 months to upload the lot.

 I find posts saying the solution is a reverse proxy, but when further researching them and trying to set one up (nginx), I cant find a good step by step for what I am wanting to do, especially not on Windows.
 I have also tried Traefik, but again, I cannot find a guide I understand. Got the docker container for it going, but don't know how to get 443 in there, and Bitwarden container wont start after it because Traefik is using the ports it wants.
 Any good simple guides on how to do this? Seems like it might be too niche to find, "Dockers using the same port, nginx fix".
 I'm just so frustrated and lost.

 I got a new R620 (710 mini embedded) in my basement and put in 3 x WD Blue SSDs. I was able to power up the system, it found the drives, I created the virtual disk, initialized things, and then rebooted. 
 Now, all 3 drives just blink amber, and I get warnings on some little LCD screen saying something about "PDR1001".
 I find it hard to believe all 3 drives went bad minutes after I built a raid, but I have no idea where else to look. I have no idea how to troubleshoot something like this, I can't get into the OS and troubleshoot things since this is in a firmware raid. 
 I can get into iDRAC and it says the drives are in a "foreign" state. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 Very new to this so please excuse me if this is a stupid question.
 I'm currently running 2 servers:
  
Dell R720XD (NAS with TrueNAS core)
 HP ML350 G9 (Proxmox VMs)
  
I'm currently running a gigabit network, however I'd love to have a 10gb link between my two servers so the VMs and server can have better bandwidth to the NAS. 
 Is it possible and reasonable to consider a direct P2P connection between the two using something like an SFP+ DAC cable? I'm considering this as I'd rather not cough up for a more pricey 10gbe switch.
 Thanks!

I've been using my old NUC (NUC6CAYS) with 8gb ram and 4-core celeron, mostly for its low power usage. However, It only has 1 sata port and 32gb emmc. I have several hard drives lying around that I want to use for backups and increased storage. Its specs are enough for me, and it remains idle almost always. I use syncthing, photo backup, pc backup, documents, etc.
 I want something that sips on power, and gives me more sata ports without breaking the bank. 
 My thoughts are:
  
a SBC with multiple sata ports
 a SBC with a HDD dock connected via usb
 helios64 which is expensive and is out of stock
 some aliexpress concoction

Is there some way I can have my server notify me when the drive disappears so I don’t find out when someone tries to watch something and Plex doesn’t respond?
 ideally, I’d like to figure out why it disappears, but as a stop-gap, the notification would at least let me restart the iscsi stack to get it back up and running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am new to this subreddit and it looks like there is a lot of info about that which has been concerning me a lot recently.
 At one point I started to use OneDrive to sync some files that I don’t want to risk losing if either my laptop computer or my desktop craps out on me. In retrospect I think this was a bad idea as OneDrive did something I didn’t want it to do and gave me extra work.
 I selected to backup three areas which it insists the user keep synced to their cloud service which are desktop, documents, and pictures folders.
 I naively thought that when I select sync for desktop of one and of desktop on another computer that the files would be in the cloud separately attributed to the different computers. Instead it threw everything together on both desktop. I of course don’t need shortcuts to programs that are only installed on one to appear on the desktop of another computer. 
 Now if I keep the option to “sync” on on both of them, if I delete the shortcut on the wrong computer, it disappears from the other computer.
 Can anyone suggest a solution to bring it back to normal. I assume there is no function to “revert the sync” in OneDrive, so it seems I have to turn the sync off for both computers then sort out the files, then never to turn again.
 If anyone can give me any help and instructions how to do this or maybe how to keep the desktops backed up without something like this fiasco happening, please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been wanting to get a server for personal storage as well as a homelab environment, game servers for my friends, etc. but didn't have the guts to pull the trigger until last week.
 I live in a studio apartment, but my closet is large enough to hold this without it taking up too much space. From top to bottom:
  
1U 24 port passthrough/coupler patch panel
 1U rack shelf with the Ubiquiti UniFi USW Lite 8 PoE switch
 Ubiquiti UDM-Pro gateway/router/UniFi OS Console
 Ubiquiti UNVR (currently not in use, just for testing)
 HPE DL80 Gen9 Server
 StarTech PDU in the rear
  
Waiting on an HBA card for the DL80 which I am hoping will tone down the fans which are currently unbearable to listen to. If not I guess I will have to upload custom firmware to manually control the fan speed (if anyone knows these servers well and can give me some pointers, please feel free to do so). Also, I know someone is going to gripe about the lack of a UPS... believe me, I know I need one. I just can't afford to shell out $1,000+ on a quality UPS right now. It's on my list.
 I'm planning on using the DL80 for personal storage (music, photos, videos/TV/movies), game servers for my friends and I, and a general testing workspace for new projects and services. Running Proxmox VE, planning on running TrueNAS and passing through the 10TB drives to it. Waiting on more drive caddies before putting in the last 10TB drive and a SAS SSD I got (also have a 500GB NVMe for OS).
 Let me know what you think, and any tips or pointers you may have for a newcomer!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me explain... currently my Hypervisor is a Lenovo M93p Desktop that I got for free from work. Its a i7-4770 with 32 GBs of DDR3 RAM. Its dead silent and I'm not sure about the amount of power consumption it draws but it works. Out of the 8 VMs I run I currently have a 2 CPUs 2 GBs RAM allocation setup per machine with the exception of my minecraft server that I have give more resources but don't have it running all the time. But what is considered overkill? I wouldn't mind having a used PowerEdge or ProLiant but not sure if its worth having one. I was thinking if anything I would like something no more than 256 GBs of RAM, 4 CPUs 8GBs per host, and low power consumption like this.
 I guess this can be considered a "what are your hardware specs" but what are your thoughts on this?

 Please forgive quest and yes did searching but couldn't quite figure an answer. 
 I currently have Comcast with 1gb service getting about 1200 for speed. The xb8 Comcast router has a 2.5gb port. 
 My home router currently is the xr500 but doesn't have the 2.5gb port. 
 I would like to have at least 2 servers on 2.5gb speed. 
 Would I just need a router that can do that? 
 What would I need to get the 2 ports at 2.5gb?
 Thank you Bill

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My answer, I would guess about 6.83 kB, since we'd have 7,000 bytes of data, and to divide that by 1024 would equal 6.83 (truncated digits), since I estimate an average rate of 7 characters per word (6 letters with one spacebar after, sometimes in addition to punctuation marks).
 In old school computing, one byte of data has a 1:1 conversion ratio to ASCII characters, which consist of things such as letters of the alphabet, numeric digits, punctuation marks, spaces between words, and even starts of new paragraphs, which we sometimes call "carriage returns".
 But now, let's see if anybody else has a differing idea on how many ASCII/Unicode characters a thousand word essay would equate to...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On top of it being crippled by terrible DRM I am inspired to go to my local library and scan these books myself. If anyone is familiar with these children books they have high quality picture photos of an assortment of objects and with the right lighting and scenery they are incredible to look at.
 The pages on archive.org have terrible glaring to them which hinder the ability to find all objects that is asked of the reader. I'd like to be able to check out these books at my local library and have them professionally scanned somehow, if it were a simple text book it wouldn't be that much of an issue but given the detail of these books I'm hoping to do better.
 I called all of my local libraries too and all they have are simple flatbed scanners which wouldn't be suitable for something like this and the DPI isnt high enough to capture every detail in these photos. Does anyone have any ideas for me on getting these books scanned?

 Look at the very bottom of the page to see all available books.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a friend whose college network blocks certain connections, such as SSH or anything custom that uses SSL. I know enough to know that if I re-host the same service at the same port with no SSL, it works. This makes no sense to me, but does make me feel pretty uneasy since one of the things we use is a self-hosted voice/text chat server.
 I've been getting into self-hosting a bit and have looked at stuff like Pivpn for myself. But before I go experimenting and taking up this person's college time, I'm wondering if anyone has ideas for things that would be most likely to defeat this. I know that given the original problem, it's possible that some or all VPN protocols might not work. I haven't tried simply hosting the service on port 443, so I don't know if they're doing something special to monitor traffic. We did find that a particular text-based rmote access protocol is functioning fine, but various other secure connections are blocked. All of the above are using TCP and SSL. I have no idea what the firewall is doing here, but I'm unhappy that it's forcing us to send things back and forth in the clear, so if I can fix it, I'd like to do so.

 Just a refresher: almost a month ago I announced Fasten, an open-source, self-hosted, personal/family electronic medical record aggregator, designed to integrate with 1000's of insurances/hospitals/clinics
 Here's a couple of screenshots that'll remind you what it looks like:
 Fasten Screenshots 
  
Since then I've been busy having (incredibly thought-provoking) conversations with some of you, chatting with HIPAA lawyers & professionals, and re-architecting the application to support zero-knowledge encryption. 
 It's taken a lot longer than I expected, but thankfully the code is back to a state that is useable, but still slightly embarrassing :)
 Here's a quick summary of the changes I've made:

I'm aware of the risks with RAID 0 (i.e. no redundancy and an increased risk of failure), but sadly I don't have budget for another drive to add as a spare. I am nearing the end of the free space on this array, so a new drive will likely be required in the next ~6 months. I'll have to make budget for this, as this is more a priority than adding a spare -- or multiple -- (unused) drive(s). I'm sort of 'targetting' 32TB of data, eventually.
 I currently back this array up to 2 x 16TB WD Elements external drives. The two external drives are a RAID 0 (again, mdadm).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(I hope this is ok to post here in r/selfhosted, as we are looking for services and software we can host ourselves)
 As the title suggests. I’m looking for good alternatives that let me and my small team remote into our work machines at home. 
 We use a lot of gpu intensive programs (blender, Houdini, nuke and resolve) and would like to have a smooth as possible experience. 
 We’re currently using VPN and NoMachine which have worked well, and we have been impressed with Teradici in the past at previous companies.
 VNC never produced fluid enough motions, and the fps tanked when we ran it through guacamole (which also filtered the image stream making it blurry)
 TeamViewer isn’t accelerated (when we tested it) and was also dog slow.
 Parsec doesn’t have a Linux version.
 X2go was kinda cool but also couldn’t deliver the speed we would like.
 We’re using xpra internally for some sharing of sessions for some tools. Which works great but it’s not a one stop shop for removing into our infra.
 I would ideally want to get rid of the vpn and instead have some kind of broker. 
 Anyone I’ve missed? I’m sure a lot have happened during the pandemic /work from home revolution.
 Also, I’m pretty sure we have not optimised our infrastructure sufficiently enough for remote sessions to be at its best. So any tips on how to improve beyond just software choices would be cool.
 Thoughts?

 they use different volumes, and I know that Immich use a different folder structure from Nextcloud, but I don't care how it's saved on Nextcloud I just want it to be there if Immich goes down and I can't access my photos.
 For me it's ok to have the same files duplicated, one in the Immich volume and the other in the Nextcloud volume, but how can I do it? It needs to be an automated thing, because when I add images at Immich I want those files automatically backuped to nextcloud (doesn't need to be instant, if it's done once a day I'm ok) 
 How can I achieve that?

 I've looked into wireguard to set up a tunnel but I don't think it's possible with my proxmox setup unless I install on the host which I'm reluctant to do.
 I have Heimdall dashboard which is accessible via dynamic dns but obviously I can't access any services unless I gave each one its own ddns and port forward.
 I could maybe use Organizer dashboard as that shows everything in an iframe so should work.
 Any other ideas? Or best approach

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I would like to get recommendation on how I can improve my current setup.
 Here's my dashboard.
 Setup:
  
Asustor NAS with 4x1TB HDDs in RAID 5 - used as my media storage.
 HP EliteBook 840 G1 (i7-4510U CPU @ 2.00GHz, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM)
 Nvidia Shield for my living room TV
  
My laptop/server is running Portainer with:
  
All of the *arr stack for media
 PiHole as the DNS server at home
 NPM for reverse proxy
 Uptime kuma - although I'm not doing anything special with it.
 Heimdal for the dashboard
  
When I first started I wanted to start small, so my goals were:
  
Successfully setting up the whole *arr stack to handle media properly. It took some time to understand best practices listed by https://trash-guides.info/
 Accessing my services locally using a host name instead of an IP.
 Having a dashboard to access everything easily.
  
Stuff I still need help with:
  
Monitoring. I have uptime kuma, but still haven't figured out which services to watch, or how to make sure my containers are highly available/fault tolerant.
 
SSL everything. I was thinking about buying a domain and setting all of my services to it instead of the service.local setup I have currently. Any recommendations on this subject? I wouldn't like to expose my IP to the internet, even behind a DDNS server so I saw Cloudflare has some solution. I currently use Tailscale.
 
 If anyone has any more recommendation, I'll be happy to hear. What else can I safely host at home?
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My family needs storage for family photos, videos, and music. I'm trying to get away from cloud services, mostly because it seems silly to pay to use someone else's computer to store our stuff. I was about to go back to an external hard drive when I learned about NAS options. I think this would work well for my needs, but I'm not tech saavy and have been struggling to understand what I would need and how to get it set up. I have Google Fiber in my home with two pucks.
 What hardware do I need? I'm under the impression I would need something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DS120j-DiskStation-Diskless-512MB/dp/B07ZKSLVT5?th=1
 And then I'd need an actual hard drive to go in it, right? 
 How hard is the setup? Am I missing anything or is this just as simple as plugging into the google router and downloading the companion app on our phones/laptops? Are there any compatibility issues with different users running apple vs. android vs. windows, etc? 
 Thank you for the help, and if this has all been answered elsewhere, feel free to redirect me.

So I figured maybe I can use ILLA to build a self-hosted dashboard that uses Bitly's API or just import the CSV. I want to use ILLA to build a UTM management tool that can do data visualization.
 I will keep posting my progress here. If I can use ILLA to build such a tool, I can save about $180 per month.

 I'm trying to get Heimdall consistently displaying on screens larger than 1024 pixels wide. At the moment Heimdall streches my apps right across the screen. There is probably a way of doing this with CSS but I'm struggling. So far using
 #app .content { margin: auto; max-width: 1024px; } 
 Gets me the desired 3-column layout, but it leaves a big grey blank space to the side of Heimdall and adds a horizontal scrollbar.
 Is there any CSS solution for this?
 Many thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So yes I got the Cloudflare email to get up to 4 Yubikeys at 10$ each.
 I looked at them and while I love the idea of owning a new piece of hardware that everyone is talking about, I can't understand why I'd actually need it. Especially that it turns out the 5C NFC is actually 15 EUR, not 10 and shipping is an extra 5 EUR (not free). Plus maybe VAT and fees because I don't live in the EEU.
 Right now, I'm using Bitwarden Premium. It has 2FA for every service that supports it. It's on my iPhone and in my browser. Whenever a site needs a TOTP, Bitwarden automatically fills it in. Services that use SMS as 2FA suck, there aren't many, and when they do that there is no option to use anything else than SMS anyway (or I'd be using Bitwarden for them)
 It's not like it's a hassle to get Bitwarden to enter the TOTP (on the phone or the computer), and I almost never receive the TOTP over SMS.
 So... What does a Yubikey do for me there? It doesn't feel like I need one, and I'd rather avoid spending money just for the sake of it. What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly I'd like to say I'm fully aware this community isn't exactly meant for this type of post; I searched for GSmartControl subs, storage subs, SSD subs, etc., and I decided that this was the most appropriate sub out of all of the ones I was able to find. If there's a more relevant sub I should have posted on, please comment it!!
 So, the question is, is my SSD dying?
 Screenshot of the GSmartControl Attributes Page
 The last time I checked GSmartControl was about 1.5 years ago, and there were no pre-failure warnings and I don't recall "old age" messages either. I searched up things such as "gsmartcontrol type," "gsmartcontrol threshold," "smart pre-failure" etc., I even searched all of those terms inside of the GSmartControl wiki, yet I still don't really understand what they mean or if my drive is actually dying.
 ​
 Do any of you Storage Gods know if I should be worrying/panic-backing-up right now? Thank you to everyone who read this far, I hope you're doing well <3

 I recently moved from Hyper-V to Proxmox, and was using Veeam community edition for backup. 
 This is not working now (tried adding the windows server as a physical server, but it just refuses to authenticate it, says it cant mount the admin share, which the user should be able to do... ie just wont work) 
 So looking for something else that truncates the logs ect. Does anyone have any recommendations? 
 Also, is anyone using backblaze? recommend? Best way to back up though Proxmox? 
 Thanks guys :)

But I don't think I've ever really had a drive fail under normal use, obviously I have had drives fail ... due to damage (dropping, incorrectly wiring, disassembly etc). I've got an original WD Red 4 TB that is a pretty great drive that I use for my backups (WoRN), along with an external Drive for archiving. I also have a bunch of SSD's and HDD's that are basically whatever was cheapest/best value drives at the time (Plus Samsung Pro480 & 850EVO SSDs). 
 ​
 However, despite having a bunch of drivers I've never had a drive really fail, am I just lucky, or are drive failures uncomon under fairly normal use?

 Built a TinyMiniMicro from ebay with on hand ram/SSD.

 I want to mirror the 1TB drive to 1TB of the 4TB and have 3TB unmirrored for things that don't need redundancy.
 I'd like to do that on an OS that can do a 3+2+1 backup strategy with low/no maintenance.
 Bonus if the OS can hypervise (proxmox?) or host the NAS as VM. Double bonus for being bit-rot proof.

 https://hub.docker.com/r/vulnerables/web-dvwa
 ​
  
Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goal is to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and to aid both students & teachers to learn about web application security in a controlled class room environment.
  
I notice that internet is available on this vulnerable image as it was set with bridge network mode by default.
 $ docker inspect web-dvwa -f "{{json .NetworkSettings.Networks }}" {"bridge":{"IPAMConfig":null,"Links":null,"Aliases":null,"NetworkID": 
 In VirtualBox, I can have multiple network mode such as bridge and host-only?
 Is it possible to have similar setup in docker as I need Internet access for initial setup considering the limitation in the container (e.g. no ssh server, vi)
 Once complete, I would like to disable bridge and only use host-only / internal networking only without any access to the internet. 
 I also tried to change from bridge to host but didn't work
 $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES abcd vulnerables/web-dvwa "/main.sh" 2 weeks ago Up 9 minutes 127.0.0.1:80->80/tcp web-dvwa $ $ docker network connect host web-dvwa Error response from daemon: container cannot be disconnected from host network or connected to host network $

A big part of the content that was posted there like some songs that the artists dont deem worthy to be reuploaded to streaming and pictures of events has been lost. While it doesnt seem like the songs and videos have been archived by the wayback machine, the pictures are still there, so is there anyway for me to easily download them? I searched the sub didn't seem to find a solution that fit me, just found some command line commands that download from existing websites and idk if it works for archive too or how to approach it correctly. I've done data hoarder for years but its been mostly downloading stuff manually, so ive got a big chunk of the 'lost songs' from that site in my collection but i never thought about saving things like pictures too. My plan if i get them is to archive those pics on either instagram or tumblr so its more accesible for everyday users. Also im on mac if that helps anyone.

 I saw some pictures of a submodel indeed having that but I wanna make sure mine does to before I open the sucker up. But how do I know if it does?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there hope you're having a great day.
 Over the past year I have been building up my homeserver (ansible-nas base + lot of advice for setup lurking here :) ) and for the most part I am happy with it. 
 Though I do struggle with the "proper" setup of my storage-setup:
 Currently I use 4 SSD - 2 old 250GB drives and 2 new 1TB, which run in a ZFS mirror.
 I mounted my media files to the ZFS pool and for backup and system I use one of the old ones each.
 Putting the cloud storage for additional backups (3-2-1- rule) aside - does this look like a fair storage setup or is it something I should change? 
 Data on the backups are mostly pictures and music (+couple of old movies).
 Thanks in advance

 I have a 2700X CPU available but would need to buy MOBO/32GB RAM. I could underclock and undervolt to lower power consumption potentially but I haven’t tried this. Alternatively I could get a i3-12100 along with a Z690 and DDR4. 
 Which route would you go given the choice?

 I hope somebody can help me with the problem I have with setting up a reverse proxy on my system.
 The system has 5 IP addresses (don't want to get into details why) and the reverse proxy is working fine when the target webserver (same box, sonarr on port 8989) bound to to all ip address on the system. When I bind the interface for the target webserver to a specific IP address, I get 502 bad gateway (no changes in Nginx config). The website is still running when I use the direct IP address, it just doesn't work anymore through the reverse proxy. 
 Any idea what could be wrong?
 Thanks in advance.

 Server is setup with Proxmox for virtualization. I have an OpenMediaVault VM setup that uses the 6tb drives for its SMB storage. I have a Jellyfin server setup to mount a share from the OMV vm and to use it as its library. It’s port forwarded so friends/family/me can use it outside of the network to watch things. I also have a VM setup with Win10 LTSC that runs my YACReaderLibrary server, and that is port forwarded so I can read comics on my iPad without them taking up space on my iPad. This vm uses the SMB share to hold the comic book files.
 DVD ripper is there so I can rip older Fullscreen dvds and import them into Jellyfin to stream to my CRT TV. I have a Sony Trinitron KV-27FS120 crt that I watch older shows/anime/movies on and I use jellyfin and this to rip the dvds and stream them to my tv. I use makemkv and powershell with a custom gui to autorip multiple dvds at a time with this machine.
 And that’s the rundown for my homelab!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create a VPN to connect my two remote devices (say A - Server, B - Client). Explored Tailscale and other services, but I wanted a server with the control over keys and config. This article helped me to setup a hub-spoke VPN with the hub on a VPS. But it had few concerns regarding security. Let's say my VPS provider or an intruder, say X, manages to gain access to the server. Possible impact :
  
X can impersonate as a peer. All he has to do is switch Endpoint A's public key with his key and restart wg and he'll start receiving packets from an unsuspected client B.
 X can view the unencrypted packets as the hub has to decrypt and re-encrypt before forwarding packets between the spokes.
  
I was searching for some way in which these can be solved and I saw this article from the same person. To sum it up, there are two layers of tunnels, one hub-spoke as explained above, and another inner layer just between the two spokes through the outer layer. This kind of makes it a virtual point-point topology setup for the inner layer which adds its own layer of encryption. So with firewall properly setup in the peers, now if X manages to gain access:
  
X can impersonate as a peer in the outer layer, but his packets will not reach my peer's inner layer as the private & public keys of inner layer is never known to the hub(VPS). So effectively the incoming connection is rejected by wireguard (on wg port) and firewall (on other ports).
 X can view unencrypted packets coming from outer layer. But there is one more layer of encryption in the inner layer which makes it effectively E2E.
  
I believe setting up a hub-spoke this way will be safe and private on any VPS as long as the wireguard cryptography isn't broken. Please comment if I'm missing anything here which could compromise this setup.

 I just got a good gpu and I was thinking of setting up really anything that can benefit from having a gpu.
 First that came into my mind was a private game cloud server, but couldn’t find anything that could be hosted from Linux.
 Any ideas? Cheers!

 How would one merge these folders to a new folder with every unique version of files and discard the duplicates, with the goal to save storagespace and ease of browsing for content later?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Everyone, 
 I’m trying to build a new storage unit to move from my drobo 5C to something else. I was able to get a case with 6 drive bays and wanted to add more to it. I was hoping for some help and suggestions if anyone is will to help. 
 My drobo has 3 12tb drives and 2 8tb drives. 
 I want to buy 5 16tb drives and put them in my new case then transfer the data from the drobo to the new drives then move the drobo drives to the new case but I don’t have enough space for all those drives and saw some recommend 5.25 to 3.5 inch drive converters. How good are they and any recommend ones? I want to stay with windows and will probably use stablebit drive pool to manage the drives. Not sure what Raid to use with all the drives or how to manage 10 drives all together in these varying sizes. Any suggestions or changes to this I’m here to listen and see what to do. Any different way of using it proceeding with the drives is okay with me, open for any suggestions. 
 The case if anyone is interested is 
 Corsair Graphite Series™ 600T Mesh Mid-Tower Case from like 10 years ago.

I'm thinking of getting a WiFi camera to place outside, and the software could take a picture of the site once or twice a day, at scheduled times. When construction is done, I thought it would be cool to have a slideshow of these pictures to show the progress.
 I've found Shinobi and Zoneminder, but couldn't find this particular feature. Any suggestions or ideas?

 Im trying to get an instance of ToolJets spun up via Portainer but I'm getting a little lost on the docker-compose.yaml.
 I use two directories. One to store my apps and then app database/data
 /mnt/apps
 /mnt/tankbox
 ​
 I was able to find this this yaml(https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet/blob/develop/docker-compose.yaml). But I have no idea where to begin. I have launched other container but they were fairly simple docker-compose.yamls this one is a bit more entailed. Just need know what fields of the yaml to edit.

 I figured it out using Powershell. I was going to delete the post, but figured I'd post the solution in case anyone else found it useful-

 In addition, I’ve seen this happening on a lot of other old stock inventory as well. Am I just unlucky or are hoarders trying to make more money in a down market?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current goal is to replace google photos for 2 users, possibly expanding to the entire family if it's a good solution. Being mobile friendly is important, auto sync with mobile devices as pictures are taken (or maybe on next wifi connection) is a strong desire. Being able to share photos cross-platform (as in a link that plays nicely with text messages) is a requirement. Shared photo albums would be nice. 
 I started here. Thank you mods and contributors, this list is beautiful.
 https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#photo-and-video-galleries 
 PhotoPrism looks appealing (especially since I have a spare Coral laying around). I really like how LibrePhotos looks, Immich, ImageStore, HomeGallery, and Damselfly all look good too. Unfortunately lots of these either don't have a mobile app or require sideloading. That's fine for me, but maybe not for user #2, and definitely not for any additional users someday. So my questions: 
  
Any overall recommendations for this photo software use case?
 
Am I thinking about this wrong, should syncing and photo hosting be separate parts of a bigger software stack?
 
If yes to previous, any guidance on coming up with a list of software I need to host to be a robust backbone for future self-hosting?
 
 A bit of background on what I'm currently running: 
  
Truenas on decent but low-power
 
Homeassistant recently migrated from a VM to a mini pc
 
Some linux VMs on the Truenas box for things like a minecraft server and testing
 
pfsense to keep things organized and as safe as I can
 
 edit: someday I'll learn how to format correctly before I post, but apparently not today

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I discovered yunohost recently but unfortunately it's just buggy up one side and down the other. I love what they're doing but there is so much that is poorly documented or straight up doesn't work that I think I'll have to let it mature a little more before contributing.
 I'm looking at Cloudron. I don't mind the monthly fee to support the project, but the fact that they absolutely mandate Ubuntu is a deal breaker. I moved all my self-hosted stuff to Debian due to Canonical's advertising. I saw Sandstorm, but it seems lack multiple apps that are must-haves for me (Matrix, Cryptpad, etc). I love where Freedombox is going but out-of-the-box, no-apps-installed performance was very poor with heavy CPU load, even at idle, on every device I tried. 
 I know AIO solutions aren't perfect for everyone. What I like about them is they let me easily and quickly drop in and out of apps that I might be interested in. I'd be wary of running a production platform using one but for tinkering and getting a feel for an app, they're great.
 Are there any others I might have missed?

 A thing that is not clear to me to complete the evaluation if there is a solution that can easily import all trello cards and boards (for now I can lose labels and custom fields), from the beginning to now., if it is possible via trello's api+token.
 Have you got some experiences about it?
 Thanks!!!

        <updated>2022-10-12T11:59:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I've been working on something I would like to share with you. It's called Assetgrid and it's a personal finance management tool.
 Github repo: https://github.com/assetgrid/assetgridapp
 Website: https://assetgrid.app
 Screenshots: https://assetgrid.app/screenshots
 What can Assetgrid do at the moment?
 At the moment Assetgrid is a bit basic, but still useful, which is why I'm sharing it. It has a powerful CSV importer, simple transaction categorization and it can display your spending in categories and your cash flow and balance over time.
 It also has a powerful query engine and allows bulk editing, so you can quickly categorize your transactions based on simple criteria. If you want a quick overview of your personal finances, give it a try.
 In the future I have bigger plans.
 The vision / long term aims for the project
 I created Assetgrid because I felt that most self-hosted personal finance tools were very tuned for a single task. Most commonly budgets. That allows for very easy to use and intuitive software, but I just personally needed something more. I'd have one tool to keep track of receipts, another for budgets, a third for loans and investments and I'd be entering the same information into each tool. I think it just makes sense to collect it all in one place.
 In the near future I will add automation, so you can automatically process imported transactions. I will also add a metadata that allows you to attach any kind of information like file attachments, relations and notes to your data. Once I'm satisfied with the import/processing aspect I will begin working on budgets, bills, currencies and non-cash assets. I have spent a lot of time considering how the various features should play together and I have some ideas for how to integrate the features in an efficient workflow that doesn't get in your way and only presents you to the subset of features you use.

 Ideally I'd like to have docker container, that will be configured with a repo link and serves the static pages of this repo. I.e. initially clones and adds a hook to pull on new commits.
 If it optionally allows to execute a build command on every commit, that would be nice.

 After discontinuing the H2+ due to the parts shortage they now have the H3 and H3+ with an Intel N5105 / N6000 CPU. The box has 2.5 Gbit ethernet and can even be used with the NVMe to ethernet net card.
 This makes for a really awesome low power server and should even be a really capable OPNsense box with that net card. The case options also look amazing, small and simple yet flexible. Having only two SATA ports might be a bit limiting for data horders but then again it's easy to add more via USB anyway.
 I'm really liking what I see there. Especially with power prices surging all over the world, I think this might be a really great low power server recommendation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a complete beginner that is learning how to make a website for fun through a VPS. However, I'm just worried a bit about security and was wondering if someone can ease my anxiety a bit. Here are my questions (with some context included):
  
Most of my stuff is written in HTML and CSS, but I'm not sure if I made a mistake by making each page a .php file instead of .html. The only thing I have written in PHP is a form that sends messages to my Discord server via webhooks, but that's it. Can someone possibly take advantage of this?
 The thing is, I did some research today and realized that I should probably avoid PHP/SQL for now in case someone takes advantage of my mistakes. I wanted to make a dynamic website at first, but I realized that I should probably stick with a static website considering how new I am at this.
 I've been connecting to my VPS from my laptop using WinSCP (SFTP). If my server were to get hacked, would it even be remotely possible for them to compromise my laptop? I've been using it to edit my files.
  
P.S. I disabled logins via passwords and use a private key. I added Fail2Ban as well. I'm sorry if anyone gets annoyed with my questions, considering I am a complete newbie at this. I'm open to taking safer alternatives in case I'm making really bad mistakes. Thanks!

 I'm looking at how to get files from my seedbox to my LAN. My connection is pretty slow so I need to limit my downloads to certain times a day. 
 Thinking about somehow using my rclone or syncthing setup, but I thought I'll check what others are using.
 Wishlist:
  
bandwidth (per month?) & speed limitation, 
 SFTP, 
 scheduling, 
 pause/resume downloads
 detect new files
 deluge / arr suite integration (?)
  
Thanks in advance!
 PS. I know I need a better internet provider, looking into that as well

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Synology NAS (DS418) that contains all my media files. I am using a Pi400 and some Docker containers to run the software I use to fill the server (*arrs, download client, etc.).
 I would like to use Unmanic to do what it does and transcode the media files as they come in. I have it set up in its own container, and it seems to be running fine. However, it is DEAD slow when transcoding, which is—you know—the thing I need it to do.
 My assumption is that using the Pi400 as a transcoding device is unreasonable. Not enough umph. Is this correct? Is there something I can do to make this work? Installing Unmanic on the NAS itself would be ideal, but I cannot do it because, well, the Synology DS418 has some limitations.
 Is there a better way to go about this? Should I just start looking for a cheap GPU to create a dedicated transcoding box?
 Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even if the answer is, "It's impossible," it would still be more than I've been able to coax out of Google in the last two weeks.

 Right now all three of them are in separate docker images, but they're all also mono based, which is pretty heavy. I'm toying with the idea of making a custom "arr" docker container with all three of them inside.
 This would save space on images, and I'm hoping it would also give a bit of a memory boost because they'd all be sharing a single mono runtime, although I'm not so sure if that's the case.
 Anyway, I'm wondering if anyone has done something similar, or if it's not as good of an idea as I'm thinking.

 I'm building a Frankenstein drive testing rig (I sell lots of used drives on Reddit) and it's getting an upgrade from the HP backplane that I have. I needed to expand into the 12 Gbps realm, and this seemed like a good choice.
 Basically, I need someone to probe the back of their backplane with the power on, and tell me what voltage they get from the gray power cables going into either the motherboard or the backplane. I *think* they are 12v and GND respectively, but I'd rather be sure before I blow up a backplane.
 So, please, if you're able, can someone get me the readings? If not, I'll risk sacrificing a board for science. XD
 Thank you very much!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm considering adding an extra couple of drives to my main PC to max out the internal bays while I have an opportunity to jump on a sale, but I don't want to risk killing something if I accidentally overload the PSU.
 It's currently running a Corsair CS650M with this loadout (I chose "Gaming Keyboard" to play it safe, since I don't know if my 2013 PS/2-attached Unicomp keyboard is as heavy on the power as I've heard original IBM Model Ms are, and one of the unnamed USB devices is intermittent use of an XBox 360 controller) and I noticed that it's claiming I'm worryingly close to the rated 130W combined maximum for the PSU's 3.3V and 5V rails.
 However, I also notice that it's assigning 3W to the 5V rail per 7200 RPM SATA drive and 1W per 5400RPM SATA drive. Does that sound right for a Seagate Ironwolf and a couple of dissimilarly-sized WD Reds? The Seagate spec sheets only list the 12V peak load and I'm unclear if I'm reading it correctly that the WD spec sheets are trying to communicate that the 12V and 5V rails have the same potential peak load.
 If at all possible, I'd also like to leave enough slack to swap in my brother's old GeForce GTX760 if my GTX750 dies before I'm ready to buy a new PC to swap my drives into.
 Can anyone provide clarity on the spec sheet side of things and is there a more suitable PSU calculator you would recommend?
 ...and if I am too close to the edge to pick up an Ironwolf Pro and a Red Pro on sale and a 2-port PCIe SATA card, would you advise a replacement PSU or can anyone suggest a trustworthy DC-DC voltage converter to supply them that shouldn't be too expensive to get a hold of in Canada? My part-picking skills more or less stop at "Check the NewEgg and Amazon reviews, and then google for a few more... possibly with the product name and the keyword 'Linux'".

I have a external hard drives that I put data on, but everything that is critical I have also backed up on google drive (I have unlimited storage through my university) and only am using around 1 TB. My externals and computers really only add up to around 2-3 TB max (if I backed everything up).
 I’ve been thinking of a NAS for ease of storage to consolidate drives and have quick access between computers, but is it even worth it if I have essentially unlimited google drive storage? Also, would a NAS even be faster if I’m using it over Wifi with 500/30 connection? Was thinking of jumping on the Amazon deal on the DS1522+, but with the drives it would be around $800-1000
 Let me hear your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I installed Portainer on a VM, and used an application template to get Nginx Proxy Manager up and running.
 Both applications are accessible if I manually type the local IP of the VM and the associated port number for each application.
 Portainer is running on 9443, and Nginx Proxy Manager has the GUI on port 81, and theoretically, it redirects via port 80.
 It doesn't seem to be working tho.
 I manually edited my /etc/hosts file to add a couple of fake domains (portainer.vm.com and nginx.vm.com) so I could test the program and see if it worked.
 Through Portainer, I added both containers to a new "Applications" network, but no matter what I try, I always end up in Nginx Proxy Manager's congratulations screen, instead of my applications. Why?
 Here is the "Applications" network: https://i.imgur.com/HHFNYrb.png
 Here you can see both applications: https://i.imgur.com/QrdFejh.png
 And here is my the proxy host I'm trying to set up: https://i.imgur.com/BiDHxaE.png
 You can see I put the local IP of the VM, which I can reach just fine. Typing https://192.168.30.66:9443 gets me to Portainer no problem. The domain itself just points to 192.168.30.66. I tried changing the IP in Nginx Proxy Manager to just "portainer", maybe it's set up as a hostname. No dice. I also tried using the internal IP of the docker network. No dice.
 Whatever I do, I always end up on the congratulations screen when accessing portainer.vm.com.
 What should I do?

 I am getting a nice /56 currently but am struggling to figure out how to incorporate it. Most of my routing is done on my L3 switch for performance reasons (ie 10G inter vlan routing). I can do slac on my router for directly connected vlans but only my DMZ vlans are there. 
 I’d like to use dhcp internally to provide dns servers, as I use an internal subdomain. Ideally I’d like to have a few IPv6 only subnets and no dns with slac is an issue.
 I’d rather not invent some cron/script to discover the v6-pd block and reconfigured my router/switch/dhcp server and all the static v6 addresses I would need on a bunch of vms (ie dns servers, etc)

 With the lowest prices I have every seen, I just purchased four 10 TB drives (40 TB total) and a brand new empty WD PR4100. Which after setting up the Raid will give me an additional 20 TB of usable space.
 Both PR4100s will have the latest OS 5 version.
 So now I will have my original PR4100 with a Raid 10 (which is nearly full) and new blank PR4100 to add to it.
 My question is.... is there any way to expand my current Raid 10 or actually probably my Volume Virtualization to expand with my second PR4100?
 I have everything setup perfectly on my current PR4100, including a VERY customized and manually configured Plex server. It would be awesome just to be able to expand the available storage available with what I have vs having two totally separate network storage units that are not linked or connected together.

 I've just released the first alpha of "The Photo Gallery" and I'd love to get your opinions.
 I mainly built this due to not liking the designs of other solutions out there and needing something simple to share wedding photos with.
 My goals were:
  
Mount a directory with photos in it (So that the wife can manage and delete the photos she doesn't want)
 Allow images to be enlarged
 Take up the full screen width
 Static HTML - why should my server be hammered every render - whilst keeping it dynamic so no build is needed when you change/add/remove photos
 Lazy loading - I personally share 800+ photos on this website
  
Let me know what you think!

 I want to add a cluster to my homelab to start learning Kubernetes. I have the opportunity to pick up some $90 M900 TFF Thinkcentres (i5-6500t, 8GB Ram, 128GB SSD), but I have a few questions before I pull the trigger.
  
Is $90s a fair price for this hardware?
 How many should I buy? Thinking maybe 4?
 Any downsides to using this type of hardware for learning Kubernetes?
 Could the BIOS have password protection? 
 I know I'm not buying future-proof hardware, but how soon would this hardware become totally obsolete or totally useless? 
  
I'm kinda new to the homelab scene but I'm eager to learn, thank you for you time!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, back in Aug 2018 I end up having to file for divorce and put half my life into climate-controlled storage ( I have a metric shitload of books and computer equipment. ) Including a whole bunch of 3.5-inch spinner HDs.
 Fast forward to this past weekend, finally emptied out my locker and moved everything into the house. Fired up the old 6-core AMD (it doesn't have AES support in the CPU) that I used to use as a daily driver - not expecting much. Fully expected the drives to be a loss.
 Won't boot. No signal on monitor... Hmm
 Figured out it was a RAM issue and now down to 8GB (2x4GB sticks.) Boots OK.
 Fire up old antix-16, ZFS is waaay back on 0.6.9-5 and the DE is fluxbox. LOL I was barebones back then, all the RAM went to ZFS and VMs.
 ​
 Fast forward, fast forward. Backed up my root filesystem, apt-get upgrade and Debian jessie is now at the latest package versions.
 ​
 Upgraded zfs from source to 0.8.6 and ran a scrub on both mirror pools. 
 0% damage, nothing to repair. 
 SMART long tests passed on all drives tested so far.
 ​
 Now I normally would not recommend doing this, #1 you will screw yourself out of disk warranty - and normally I would spin things up every 1.5 years or so - but I plain did not have the space. Was able to recover some missing spreadsheet files from my old /home and will be using the disks till they die, it's a spare system at this point and will probably be off most of the time except for some nights and weekends.
 ​
 Just wanted to post a ZFS success story. Didn't have to make hashes or anything, ZFS handles it all internally. If you have some backup data that will be sitting for a while, put it on ZFS mirrors - it might last 3.5 - 4 years!

 on the other hand External HDD can be more prone to physical damage if they're dropped often or they're not stored in a safe or a constantly moving environment.

 It will mainly run Linux (Fedora). I have 1 512GB SSD for Windows, 1 512GB SSD for Linux, and 4 TB SSD for data.
  
I went for the newest Ryzen 7950X because the new Ryzen 7 has double the memory bandwidth versus e.g. the Ryzen 5950X (83.2 GB/s versus 47.68) which is quite helpful in the CFD calculations.
 There is no dGPU: I was planning on using the iGPU only (with 1 external 4K monitor, maybe 2). I won't need the machine for machine learning or gaming initially …]]></summary>

I plan on having quite a lot of RAM for the ARC cache and I'm not too worried about having the workload be synchronous because if it dies I'll just restart the transfer or lose the couple of seconds of writes/reads. Out of curiosity, though, what would be the "way to go" in terms of CPU power?
 I was thinking about building out an x99 platform with an e5-2698v3 since they're quite cheap and pair it with some random Samsung ECC DDR4 at 2133mhz. Would that have enough power to saturate a 10G transfer? Should I spend less? More?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, today I bought WD Purple 4TB (WD42PURZ), a CMR drive with 256MB cache according to specs from WD. But I noticed this drive has trimming option for some reason. Trim on HDD's are used on SMR drives as far as I know. I've been writing random files of more than 1TB to the disk but it didn't slow down at all, it can't be an SMR drive. But when I researched, I didn't find anything related to trimming on CMR drives. I will share the datasheet from WD and a screenshot from CrystalDiskInfo:

 Also this drive has 5040RPM compared to 5400RPM of WD40PURZ. Older PURZ models first came out in 2017, these newer ones with higher caches came out earlier this year. So does anyone know what's the deal with these newer Purple models and why they have trim option?

 I’m Vihar from Appsmith, a low-code open-source tool to build internal tools and portals fast. Appsmith comes with over 45+ pre-built widgets that can be customized with JavaScript.
 Meet the Table, for instance. Even with 25% of our users sending us telemetry data, it has been used more than 820,000 times since we launched it. 🤯
 Built on top of react-table by TANStack, the Table widget on Appsmith comes with over 20+ ready-to-use features that help you build an entire CRUD app in less than thirty minutes.
 Highlights include:
  
Customizable column properties
 Default and custom themes and styles
 Pagination with Table props and Response URL
 Filter and sort options with multiple AND, OR conditions
 Custom views like Spreadsheet and Detail that auto-refresh
 In-line editing
  
We built our Table on top of it to help you build internal apps lightning-fast with ready features to support the most popular use cases—an admin panel, dashboards, monitoring apps, and more.
 Read the full teardown to learn more.
 P.S.: Appsmith can be run on Docker and K8s. The entire code is open-sourced under Apache-2.0 license. For more details, visit our GitHub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I've a question about a "good practice" to use Rsync command. I'm implementing the backups for my services (on VPS), they are running on Docker, and most of them has a "direct" volume to the project folder (not use docker volumes per se).
 Considering that these services are used only by me, there are any problem to execute Rsync without stopping the container before? For now, I'm running the backup script at 3am, so at this hour there is no activity on the services.
 Thanks in advance! Regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am in the process to, hopefully, solve my lack of backup strategies. I would like to have a NAS with ~8tb of Storage, but in a small formfactor, silent and low power consumption. I could get a HP Elitedesk 800 G2 SFF with a I5-6600, 8GB RAM and 512gb M.2 SSD for ~80€. This case would only fit 2 HDDs, which would be sufficient for now. The power consumption could be a bit high, but most likely still better than any Build I could pull off.
 I am unsure if this is a good route to Go, or if I should just get a Synology of sorts, tho they are pretty expensive and not as easily upgradable. My budget would be around 200€ for a system (excluding HDDs). Maybe someone has build something similar and/or could give me some Input!

 I need some web app that look enterprise and users should be able to log in and download installation files shared to all users in a group and also license files shared privately for that client only. 
 I also need some kind of crazy basic helpdesk interface to allow clients to open support requests that would be private between us and them. 
 I have tested Projectsend and I have also tested Gitlab to deploy installation files but they’re not exactly I wish to have.
 I can develop something but I hate spending weeks to reinvent the wheel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to upgrade the homelab, and seeing the cost/availability of Raspberry Pis, I bought some cheap Lenovo M73 Tinys instead. As a fun experiment, I wanted to see how much I could get out of them. Namely, will it have enough horsepower to run vCenter, vSAN, and Tanzu Kubernetes. 
 Result: it technically works. Which is the best kind of works! There is hardly any room for any workload, and likely would not survive if a host failed. Also, each host only has a single 1gb NIC, which means the little switch they're plugged into is pretty much saturated (Ubiquiti Flex Mini). But honestly I am surprised at how smoothly things are running, considering all the performance metrics. vCenter is snappy and vmotions of smallish VMs are only a couple minutes. No perceptible issues, although I'm not running anything particularly heavy.
 https://imgur.com/a/2eieR9l
 3x Lenovo Thinkcentre M73 Tiny with i3-4130T upgraded to 16gb of RAM (their max allowed). PCIe to M.2 adapter and an additional 256gb NVME drive (replaced the wifi card to be used as vSAN cache. Technically all-flash, but configured as Hybrid to cut down on Memory overhead). All in, under $400 total.
 If I were to do it again, I'd probably shell out for m700 tinys which can get up to 32gb of RAM. I didn't go for them in the first place because they would be significantly more expensive and I wasn't ready to spend more money for a homelab of my size. (Lets be honest, all I need are a couple Raspberry Pis). I likely will keep vSAN configured and add larger capacity drives to run 'old fashioned' VMs instead of containers.

 And I've just discovered a nice little feature.
 I have 3 machines (2 VPSes and 1 NAS) running various services, all connected by Wireguard . Homarr is being set up on VPS1, but when I enable the torrent module, it can pick the Qbittorrent instance running on the NAS!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to make automated regular backups of my online emails, contacts and calendar in case I lose access to them one day (or until I run my own self-hosted services).
 1) I'm aware of GMvault and Got-Your-Back for gmails. Are there other options that would work for other email services?
 (e.g. Outlook, etc, or perhaps as long as IMAP/POP3 support is all that's needed?)
 2) Are there apps that can do the same (make regular automated backups) for my contacts and calendar from Google (or other services)?
 I am aware of the plethora of choices for CalDAV and CardDAV servers. But a quick glance and none of them seems to support regular syncing with Google or other online services.
 Thank you.

 I just released an easy-to-setup file sharing platform. 
 Features:
  
Create a simple share with a link
 No file size limit, only your disk will be your limit
 Optionally secure your share with a visitor limit and a password
 Dark mode
  
But that's only the start I'll continue to implement features like sharing with email.
 ​
 Have a look at the project, if you want to host your own file sharing platform :) 
 Demo: https://pingvin-share.dev.eliasschneider.com
 Repository/Installation: https://github.com/stonith404/pingvin-share
 Have a nice day :)

 I'm bored to pay for hosting a wordpress & miss updates so it broke..
 And I'm wondering if someone remember that old (10 to 15 years) template/script/website (call it what you want) everybody who want to make a portfolio used ?
 Was really minimalist, white BG, menu on the left (with title over ?), like 3 ways to publish your pictures (carousel or verticaly/horizontaly align..)
 If I remember well it wasn't using database (sql) but more something like xml or a txt file to stock your preferences, and you had to login through an .htaccess
 So sorry, I'm really looking for something specific (hope I don't break the rules).
 Or maybe you can share something new for me, minimalist, easy setup/backup, it can run on a pi zero (no powah = no money spend)
 thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been at this for months now trying to get a hardware overhaul done on my main server, as well as setting up a backup server. My original configuration was as follows:
  
EVGA X99 FTW-K
 64GB DDR4-3000 RAM
 Xeon E5-2680v3
 EVGA 450w Bronze PSU
 4x M.2 to NVMe expansion cards
 Buncha drives
  
This server was in an old HAF-XB EVO cause when I built it originally, I had a separate room (and it was the only server I needed/had). After moving around, it didn't have a place and instead ended up in the middle of the floor in the living room with cats all over it (resulting in hair and various other gross things in the parts). I needed to rack it, but with racks come a bunch of new issues I am now learning to deal with. After moving the system over to the new case, the motherboard wouldn't boot. So I elected to get another one, since it had IPMI built in and I was gonna have to get an IPKVM anyway.
 My new configuration is as follows:
  
ASUS X99-WS/IPMI
 128GB DDR4-3000 RAM (combination of the previous 64GB kit with another 64GB kit, both kits are from the same manufacturer with the same timings)
 Xeon E5-2696v4
 QNAP QM2-4P-384A
 2x IBM M5110 (LSI 9207-8i)
 Bunchmore drives
  
This is getting put into a Supermicro 846E16-R1200B (originally bought a Norco RPC-4224 but ended up returning it in favor of a used R1200B). Now I'm running into a host of other issues, namely it seems like there's more headers on this ASUS X99 board than is available on the Supermicro chassis. Is this board incompatible with this case? I don't know what I have to do to get this thing to just fucking work but I'm really getting to the end of my patience trying to get this to do it's thing and any help would be wholly appreciated.

 Across the years, he's digitised his audio collection, from vinyls through to CDs as well as random torrented tracks and stored them all as mp3/wma files on 3 different devices. It amounts to less than 1TB so it's manageable, but I have two challenges.
  
Tidy up all the music and get it into one location There are A LOT of duplicates. Some folders literally just have 3 or 4 of the same song in there named slightly different things. Other folders have a nice tidy set of albums complete with meta data. Is anyone aware of a tool that I could feed all these files into for it to scrape one of each song? He's really keen to not lose any of this as some of them are rare tracks he's collected over the years.
 
Transfer onto a drive that he can access while away from home. It looks like an NAS is the best option here? I see a lot of mention of services like Plex, I'm based in the UK so not sure all of these recommendations are applicable?

 My question to them;
 I return any drives that fail a full surface format with a clean smart test, does that meet your terms for returns? ie no grade B or C drives. 
 Their answer
 We will only accept the return if the drive is not functional. 
 That sounds to me like they won't accept a grade B or C. ie clearly failing, but may be possible to format. Weird to me is that they are NOT that much cheaper than refurb sellers offering 3 to 5 year warranty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I'm a bit of a newbie here but I've done a fair bit of research and I work in cybersecurity. 
 ​
 I have a Dell R820 that I've been using for a while. It's the model with 4 CPU sockets, all of which are populated. It came with 16GB sticks of RAM in slots A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3, C1, C2, C3, D1, D2, and D3. These are all 16GB 2Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks and the server has been working fine. I have 8 sticks of 16GB 4Rx4 1066MHz DDR3 sticks of RAM that came from a different Dell server. I read that I could mix Dual Rank and Quad Rank sticks, but interpreted part of what I read as I couldn't mix the different types on the same channel. So I put the Quad Rank sticks on A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2; and put the Dual Rank sticks on starting on the next channel as A5, A6, A7 etc. 
 Is this the correct way to do this? When I booted it said it was configuring the new memory setup, but then it disabled the 7th slot for each channel (A7, B7, C7, D7). Should I just put the Quad Rank sticks on the first 2 slots of each channel and then put the Dual Rank sticks in starting on the 3rd slot of each channel? Any help is appreciated!

 Have a Peg2R6 unit that has always performed fine, and came back from vacaction to the news that it has 4 of 6 drives down after someone swapped the array and must’ve done something screwy swapping back. Now this has actually happened before and the controller tends to just flag the drives as Dead, as a precaution and I’ve always been able to force them to clear that status and just try again with a command line version of their utility, but this time that’s not working. The controller keeps returning an error saying it’s subsystem is locked, and it won’t respond to a SU level unlock command either. Wondering if anyone has had the same thing happen and if they managed to mount the array any other way? I’d even toss the drives in a PC tower with enough bays if there was a prescribed method for accessing a Promise array another way. 
 Just evaluating options before I give the astronomical quote from the recovery company to my management lol! 
 Oh and it was a six drive array in Raid5 and FOUR of the damn disks are affected. Oh yeah and it’s the main store for the last 3 months of shooting at my video company, despite me waving my arms at that four alarm fire for years. (Guys our tape system doesn’t matter when you don’t buy enough tapes and don’t give me time to backup the arrays except for every quarter.)

I choose this one because I’m planning to use the disk also to access to part of my game/Roms from a steam deck, so using a cabled Ethernet and I wanted a 7200rpm disk. 
 Any suggestion for me ? Could be useful to move the content from the old disks (two WD Red ) into this new one ?

My laptop can shut it down very peacefully but my smart TV turns it off with a horrible sound. I know I'm damaging it but it doesn't matter if you safely eject it( like when you do it on Windows) or just turn off the tv. Is there any way to prevent this from happening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m to make it easier to try new food and grocery shop better. I’ve tried grocy, kitchen owl, and mealie today. I found Mealie was great at importing the recipes including their urls automatically for and all I had to provide was the url. It does make a shopping list for me super easily, but there’s no organization to it. 
 So instead, I’m creating a pdf, copying that from my phone, and pasting it into this app anylist. Anylist is not selfhosted, but it does automatically organize the shopping list. It Will group dairy products together, vegetables in the produce section, which is great for not going in circle at the store. Kitchen owl and grocy didn’t seem to offer anything as fast and possible. Is there a different application that would make more sense, or a better way to use these applications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So after a lot of tinkering with Docker Swarm, I'm realizing it's dead and Kubernetes is the future. I am testing a 3 manager node K3s cluster with Traefik as an IngressRoute since I'm very familiar with Traefik, but the part that stumps me is the main IP for the cluster - which I think is the LoadBalancer part. 
 I have my 3 manager nodes at 10.3.11.41-42-43 but I realize I need one IP in front (like 10.3.11.40) that will do something like round robin DNS (or any other method) to point kubectl and my port forwarding to. I'm reading some stuff about metallb, but I can't find info on whether it does this. 
 I've done the dirty method of having HAproxy in a separate VM but there has to be a better way. Can someone point me in the right direction?
 Thanks!

 I don't need L3 as I'm only using LAG's w/ LACP, RTSP, and VLAN's.
 Someday it might be nice to add 40Gb to my flash based NAS but it's not really a necessity.
 Given the cost difference and my lack of L3 requirements is there any reason to go with the CRS317 over the CRS326?

 the wife has a mac laptop with small storage, so she has to transfer her files to an external HDD every now and then to free up space. The external 1Tb HDD has an exFAT filesystem, since I have an spare 1Tb internal drive around I can use an external dock and use it as a second backup. 
 What's the best way to backup things, just copy/paste? which filesystem is recommended that works well with MacOS and probably with Windows?

 So a friend of mine i was having lunch today with mentioned he just ordered a new ARC GPU to upgrade his media server to AV1, he was telling me that it would save him nearly half the space on his server if he converted everything to AV1 from h265, but im not sure if he was 100% correct. I recently converted my own media over to h265 for space-saving, but is AV1 really that much better and still similar quality?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 at the moment:
 running a unRAID VM on proxmox for storage (2x18TB). Storage is distributed to VMs through NFS.
 Thinking about:
 Ditching unRAID, running ZFS on proxmox and creating VDisks as needed
 Pro:
 -Easier/flatter setup
 -Backups are easier (proxmox backup server)
 -can ditch the NFS mounting to VMs
 -can ditch passthrough
 Cons:
 -I want raidz1 for redundancy and to be able to expand with more 18TB disks, which is harder/impossible?
 -all disks need to spin up if needed (they are mostly unused, and I want them to spin down for energy reasons [please no discussion about that, my system uses 30W spun down as of now and I don't want to double that]
 -i have to resize vhds if I ever want to adjust which VM needs how much space
 -if things go down, all data is lost. On unraid, individual disks stay readable. I don't have ECC ram which I get conflicting Infos about 
 What do you think? Anything I can do against the cons? It's running fine right now, but am rethinking if I should change it. I don't need network shares or the other stuff on unRAID.

 I have a large collection of TV shows. I'm a C# coder and wrote a method that sets a folder's or file's Date Created and Date Modified so Windows Explorer can use those columns to sort the TV shows and TV show episodes by IMDB rating or by the year that the TV show started. If you're curious, here is what that looks like.
 Over the years I have periodically sent my son hard-drives full of TV shows. He is accustomed to using the sort features. The only problem with that method is the drive getting stale. He is often interested in on-going shows and asked me to figure out a way to make episodes available as soon as I can get them (and run my code).
 I have about 16TB of TV shows. Only a teeny percentage of that is on-going shows (a new episode ev…]]></summary>

 I've been able to download some of the shorter programs (~45mins to 1hour) to completion since they don't take very long to download (15mins-1hour), but for the longer programs (~3-5 hours), the download starts off really fast (1-2MB/sec), then slows down to about 200-400 kb/s, then eventually stops altogether.

Nvme NASes are small but pricey and still quite slow (1 or 2,5gbit). USB raid enclosures (icydock, orico) seems like perfect solution for me. Portable, fast (?) and very affordable. Yet i don't know how much their raid systems are trustworthy comparing to qnap/Synology (not to mention zfs, btrfs etc)
 Does anybody have experience with them?

The way this works is that each workstation is a VM with the entire graphics card passed through. So, yeah, I needed two graphics cards.
 I know Unraid gets a bad rap because it can cost up to 120$ (one time), but the ability to have one nice computer run everything I'd ever need in the home lab is really slick! I've used enterprise level rack servers in the home lab and I didn't think was worth the noise and t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I just picked up a Poweredge T430 with a PERC H730 as well as 4x4 TB SAS drives. I have those installed and have been trying to install Proxmox and have been getting nothing but errors. 
 When trying to install using RAIDZ-2 I get an error that the ZFS root pool could not be created. So I tried installing to a single disk and got an error that it was unable to initialize physical volume /dev/sda3. I tried with each of the 4 drives individually and got the same error but instead referencing sdb3, sdc3, and sdd3. 
 So I tried going the route of installing Debian first and when trying to just install it on a single disk I got the error: The creation of swap space in partition #3 of SCSI1 (0,2,0) (sdc) failed. I tried on each disk and got the same error.
 That was all in HBA mode, so I tried to create a RAID using the H730. Each time I created one (RAID 1, RAID 10, RAID 6) it showed the status of the RAID as failed. When I would go into the Debian installer, neither the array nor the disks showed up so I could tell it wasn't working. 
 I have flashed the latest firmware to the RAID card and still no luck. I can't imagine all 4 disks are dead since I bought them from someone on r/homelabsales who had quite a lot of confirmed trades. Can you think of anything I am doing wrong that would prevent me from installing the OS on the server? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so this is my first attempt at getting into raid and I've been looking into it. I want to either go for raid 0 for the speed or raid 5 for the potential fault recovery. My files are mostly movies and TV but I will backup more or less everything on it. I already have some redundant backup in the form of a 10tb and a 4tb.
 If I get the non pro ironwolf 5x 8TB it will cost me $925. Or $23 per TB. It also leaves me no empty bays. 
 But if I get the Exos 16TB drives it will give me the same level of storage if I only get 3. Which will cost me $840 or $17.5 per TB. Which still leaves me 2 bays for expansion. 
 All of these will leave me with 32TB of storage in a raid 5 setup. But everywhere I look it seems to suggest that the ironwolf is the cheaper solution and the exos is even more expensive than the pro ironwolfs. Which would still even cost me $60 more to get the 16TB pro Ironwolfs. 
 So why is Exos listed as the more expensive and objectively better tier when it appears to be cheaper overall. Sure I won't get the same speeds as running 5 bays but eventually I could. 
 Unless I am missing something here. 
 Any input would be great. Also. I havent decided on a 5 bay enclosure yet. If anyone has any recommendations that would be great.

Right now I have used about 85TB with my cloud storage provider and would like to have at least around 160TB in a RAID setup. The problem is, I really would prefer not to have to deal with potential HDD failures when I might have the option of using far more durable/dependable SSD's. I know the cost for 20 8TB SSD's is ridiculous, but beyond the cost...is it something that would be relatively easy to do? If not, I could buy 32 10TB HDD's for about half the cost. Thank you. Also, this is for media backup (UHD, BD and DVR backups).
 EDIT: Okay, it has been made clear to me 1.) That my fears of HDD failures were overblown and going full SSD would be a substantial overreaction and 2.) The cost is so much greater that I could actually replaced an entire array of HDD's multiple times for the cost the SSD array.

 Is anybody else imaging oem recovery partition ? Is it "legal" to share them so people having the same device can restore them to factory ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Background:
  
I got an old desktop that used to be a gaming PC with an i7 CPU and 16GB of ram. 
 For some reason, I had the thought the other day that it would be super fun to just boot into a Linux distro that had easy access to VM software like QEMU, or Virtualbox, etc that would make it DEAD simply to just run some VDI's, especially ones like this from Archive.org which sound like a blast: 
 https://archive.org/details/windows-server-2016-x-64
 https://archive.org/details/windows_95_vdi
 
  
My Plan:
  
Maybe run some cool stuff with 2GB of RAM each, low headroom, but to run some useful stuff from time to time, maybe a Jellyfin instance when I want to spin it up, a DOSBox based virtual machine to play DOS games, a VM for retro games, a VM for Windows stuff, a VM for old school MacOS or Amiga era stuff, you get the idea.
  
Your Input:
  
With this in mind, I'm curious, what are the coolest Virtual Machine setups you guys currently have? 
 Would love to see what ideas people have, as I really like exploring operating systems and learning different things, etc, or retro hardware too, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been running LinuxServer.io's SWAG as a reverse proxy for ages and it's been working perfectly.
 I have Authelia securing WAN requests with 2FA. I read this article: https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/blocking-malicious-connections-with-crowdsec-and-swag
 and was interested in adding Crowdsec into the mix to do IDS / IPS. In the article it mentions that you can have crowdsec analyse and block based on the SWAG logs (fine, I get this), but it also mentions that you can have it operate at application level and access the logs of apps like nginx, wordpress, home assistant etc etc. 
 My question is; if all external traffic is being passed through SWAG as the reverse proxy, what's the benefit of having crowdsec monitor the applications as well? Does this bring extra security or is it just a duplication of effort?
 Bonus question: I also have a Unifi UDMP which does IDS / IPS at the gateway, should I just continue to use this instead (the functionality is more basic I think and doesn't really do much wrt to reporting), run both, or switch it off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've seen that the decoders and encoders on the Apple silicon M1 chips are wonderfully efficient, handling high speed h.265 encoding with what appears to be just a couple watts. Phenomenally, at the other end of things, we have the latest cards from AMD and Nvidia that can do fast transcoding but they are all 100W+ behemoths. In fact, a quick survey leads me to believe that all of the <75w GPUs available today are 5+ years old which means they have old encode/decode technology. 
 My assumption is that the market for low power transcoding has gone to Intel quicksync. 
 I've recently been setting up a Dell PowerEdge to handle a number of different functions including, I had hoped, some occasional on-the-fly transcoding. Then I had to slap my forehead when I realized that the Dell server firmware doesn't support any igpu functionality - so no Intel QS for this machine. I would have to add a separate video card if I want hardware encoding. But there aren't any attractive options that I can find.

 Over the years I've collected a lot of random very old books, some from the 1800s that I don't believe I've been able to come across online versions of. Naturally I would love to digitize these and archive them without destroying the physical book, or mailing it to someone else for them to keep.
 Does anyone have any experience with archiving physical books in digital form at home? I assume this can be done with some kind of camera setup, or potentially an app specializing in this thing.
 Does anyone here have any experience with this?

 It'll save me money on buying sata controllers, provide me with better redundancy and better utilization of my servers since the "NAS" wouldn't be sitting idle, better expandability since once I run out of space to put hard drives in the machines I got I can just buy a new one without worrying about zpools or raid (which will make my cluster grow too). I plan on each of them having at least 3gbit of bandwidth so that shouldn't be an issue.
 Is someone out there running that kind of setup? What software/filesystem would be the best for that kind of application? What are the drawbacks for that approach compared to conventional NAS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK - I'm a bit all over the place, but I'm wondering if anyone can point me to a good guide that will help me link a domain I purchased to my webserver?
 I bought a domain from Google Domains, then discovered CloudFlare is perhaps a bit more secure/healthy, so I've been trying to migrate it over there. At the same time, I'm trying to link it to the specific device on my network that hosts the webpage I want to display at that domain. 
 What I can currently do
  
Have a simple page locally hosted on OpenWRT (I can go on my network to 192.168.X.X:port and see my webpage come up)
 Have a port correctly forwarded (I can go from the internet to X.X.X.X:port [my public IP] and see my webpage come up)
 Log into Google Domains and see that I own a domain
 Log into CloudFlare Dashboard and see that my website is "active", that I'm using the right nameservers etc
  
What I cannot do
  
Link my domain to my X.X.X.X:port
 Get Dynamic DNS properly running on OpenWRT - this is a separate problem, I've followed a guide and it should be working, not sure why it's not but for now the DNS type A record on CloudFlare is accurate, because I manually entered it, so one thing at a time
  
Anyway, I can't be the first person who bought a domain and is now trying to self-host a simple web page - but I can't seem to find a good step-by-step guide online anywhere. Does anyone know of one? Or better yet, does anyone feel like jumping on a voice call with me on discord and walking me through something I might be doing wrong?
 Also - is the right thing to forward a random port? Or should I be using 80/443 somehow and have an internal proxy? Or is Cloudflare enough?
 Thanks everyone

 All the classics are there: basically the whole ARR-stack, Plex, Jellyfin and friends. But also other apps not usually mentioned, like MediaCMS, Funkwhale and so on. Those allow you to self-host Spotify or Youtube-like experiences, not all of them are one-click though. 
 Anything missing? What apps should I add/did I get the categories right?

The use of an authentication portal like Authelia will also greatly improve security. Adding a Cloudflare proxy will mask your real IP and increase security even more. I started with HomeLab approximately a year ago and it took a lot of time to figure out all this. So, for beginners like myself, I just want to share the full working docker-compose configuration of Traefik with Authelia and the use of CloudFlare DNS for getting Let’s Encrypt certificate for the domain. Working well for me already for some time, so I hope will be useful for others.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, might be a quick and easy question:
 My PiHole is my DNS server.
 I created a DNS entry like this: pihole.local - 192.168.1.13.
 In Nginx Proxy Manager, I have it setup like this, and this is the path redirect.
 In my docker-compose for the PiHole part, instead of exposing port 80, I exposed 82 on the host:
 pihole: container_name: pihole image: pihole/pihole:latest ports: - "53:53/tcp" - "53:53/udp" - "82:80/tcp" 
 When I navigate to pihole.local, I see the "Congratulations!" page. If I go to pihole.local/admin, I see the PiHole UI, but I'm not sure why it doesn't do it automatically.
 Eventually, I want to go to pihole.local and be moved to 192.168.1.13/admin since that is the admin UI for PiHole.
 Any help would be appreciated :)

I have a few large torrents I'd like to download that are too big for my computer, and I plan to move them to the cloud anyway, so sending them directly to the cloud would be the best option for me. Is there a tutorial on how to do this? I'd like to use as little third party software as possible, and without paying for a seedbox or something.
 I currently use qbittorent on mac but I also have access to a PC and wouldn't mind switching torrent clients. Thank you!

 I have thousands of books downloaded and they aren't all named consistently. I'd like to rename all of them by "author-title-year" and group duplicate books together. Some duplicates may be different editions/quality scans so I don't want to delete them right away, so if it's possible to check if they files are exactly the same or not that would also help. also... the files are all stored on an FTP cloud storage right now, if that makes a difference. I have both a Mac and PC available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody, I am going to transfer about 400 gigs of .MP4 files of my very old Fraps gameplay videos from a 2TB Seagate external hard drive to a 2TB internal hard drive on my Windows 10, but I want to do this in the safest way possible, and to preserve the lifespan/integrity of both drives, and also the files, I just want to make sure everything goes right.
  
To begin, the videos are all in a single folder, I could just simply copy and paste the whole 300 gb folder to the other hard drive, but I am afraid that this will overload either hard drive, or cause issues because of how big it is, so some of my friends told me to do it slowly, like, I am planning to instead transfer 10 gigabytes per minute or something, instead of everything all at the same time, idk, is this a good idea? or no?
 
From the threads about it in here and elsewhere, people say to not drag the files to the other hard drive, but to ctrl+c ctrl+v it, so I will be doing this, also I do not care how long it will take, as long as everything goes right (I think it will take around an hour or so)
 
I know that the external hard drive gets super hot when doing this, should I put a ventilator beside it? cause if so I have that ready, same for the internal hard drive too?
 
I am planning to delete the files from the external hard drive they are in, because they are just uselessly occupying too much space, but I am planning to wait some few days to see if the files are alright on the other hd.
 
 That is all, pretty simple, but I wanted some advice cause I am not too much tech savvy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 My ASUS RT-AC66U has finally started failing after 7 long years of faithful service, so I got to work replacing it with a TP-Link Archer C7 I had lying around.
 The one feature on the ASUS router I really enjoyed was the built-in DDNS server they had running. You chose any domain you wanted and it was registered to <yourdomain>.asuscomm.com. I used this for many years to access my home services and, more recently, to self-host using NPM as my reverse proxy.
 I have Namecheap as my domain registrar and while setting up my Archer C7, I discovered that Namecheap has an article specifically for configuring DD-WRT-powered routers. I was able to follow these instructions successfully, and saw that the WAN IP I have was updated properly in Namecheap's portal, so I know that's working.
 However, I cannot hit any of my services at their appropriate DNS entries. I've already confirmed the ports are forwarded, and used a port checker. I can use <WAN IP>:<PORT> and it works fine, so I know it's an issue with my DNS config, just not sure where.
 Prior to swapping routers, my DNS entries in Namecheap were:
 CNAME record, *, <ASUS DDNS domain name> CNAME record, www, <mydomainname>.com
 My new namecheap records include an A+ Dynamic DNS record, but I'm not sure how to map the entries.
 Appreciate any help with this, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there !
 I'm currently a bit shy about my setup and wont psot any pictures of it now, but i'm planing to do so.
 While I try to get enought courage to do it I'm thinking a lot about getting an actual server or get an upgrade on my current pc, as I don't have absolutely none experience with server hardware I'm kind of excited about it but ... there is always a but, here in Brazil every piece of tech is very expensive right now and used hardware is rarely reliable (a lot of fake and damaged stuff).
 I have a good pc right now, a Ryzen5 5600g + 16gb ram + asrock a320m + rtx3060 + ssd and nvme hd.
 One of my thoughts right now is to repurpose an old Athlon 3000g by upgrading my currently mobo and ram, so i can give this athlon a new place to be with this a320 + 16gb ddr4 2666 and get a new b450m + 16gb ddr4 3200. In the near future the plan is to get a dedicated CUDA gpu fot the atlhon pc.
 Would this pc be a good/viable option to run a 24/7 server runing proxmox ?
 I do have a mini pc (n5095 + 16gbram) running proxmox with a few LXC containers and Hassio on a VM, but I really want to get a way to run a face detection software with gpu processing and maybe a plex server.
 The "lab" includes an old rpi4 runing OMV, whitch I would transfer to the Atlhon pc as well.
 Financially speaking this upgrade would cost me less than a server, a used proliant gen8 can be found here for 600 ~ 1000 USD, a used r720 starts at 1500USD and to get the upgraded pc it would cost me something around 350 ~ 450 USD.
 Considering that regular pcs not always get to work well with 24/7 operation and server kind of are made for it, would you recomend? Does it worth the effort to upgrade the pc or its (much) better to wait more (2023.2 probably) to get a real server?
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any tips and sugestions.

 so far, the only thing i've tried is cypht w/ docker-compose, but that hardly worked, as I could login, but going to any page would take me back to the login screen and I wasn't able to log back in.
 the main alternatives I've found are snappymail and sogo. sogo looks really nice, but it seems heavy, as it has everything, and I only have 2.5g ram with 1.5 taken up. I also can't find a good docker image for both snappymail and sogo (i use nginx proxy manager to host everything so using docker for everything makes it easier because i can type in the container name in the dashboard, I also don't really know how to get a service on the host into nginx proxy manager)

 I'm looking for a very low powered device to run proxmox and a couple of LXC's (the tailscale subnet router and maybe a backup vpn lxc)...
 It would need to have gigabit ethernet but other than that.. just low power..
 A pi would be perfect but the prices right now are stupid..
 There are plenty of thin clients or tiny pc's out there but i don't know which to buy..
 I'm looking at sub £50 if possible.. (if it's also got Vpro then that would be awesome!)
 If the £50 didn't make it obvious.. i'm in the UK :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ill try to keep this short and easy to grasp what I'm thinking.
 Currently my media is on various 14,16,18TB disk drives. - I don't like how slow it is to wake the drives up and load the content.
 I currently have 12 4TB mx500s. - I was thinking of raid 5 or 6 for parity. 
 HOWEVER - 
 If I take 4 - 4TB MX500s and raid 0 - 16TB - ill gain 4x on read speed on top of the already gain from going from disk to ssd.
 Ill use the spin disks to make backups of each "x4-4TB raid 0" so if I lose a SSD in the raid I can rebuild from the spin disk.
 If I'm paranoid about it I can make two backups ups of the raid 0s just in case if I need to spin up the disk that has been sitting for a year and it fails ill have a backup to that backup.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had such an odd issue.
 I have a 10TB SATA drive I'm trying to get working in a new TrueNAS build. I can't get it to show up when connected to my HBA or directly to the motherboard with a SATA cable. I've tried getting to show up in lsblk on this new host but it just won't seem to.
 The model is WD101EMAZ-11G7DA0, which I don't believe needs the 3.3v mod.
 Here is the Crystal Disk Info: https://imgur.com/a/FCSN460
 I've tried multiple SATA power connectors, as well as multiple breakout cables and SATA data cables and nothing seems to help or make a difference
 The really odd thing is that the disk shows up just fine on the R720XD that I've been using until now as my NAS.
 Is anyone able to provide some insight on something I might be overlooking?

 Ive been labbing for around 7 years now and its grown to the point where I host quite a bit of stuff for friends/family on a semi serious level and have put a decent chunk of money into it, but aside from the bare minimum, ive not done a lot security wise. 
 Just logged into my FTP server and found 18k failed login attempts and that suddenly prompted an oh cock moment. 
 What would be your general tips for security hardening? I dont do anything super stupid (unique passwords for each vm, dont use root for everything, dont have unnecessary ports open, just installed fail2ban) - but I dont take any extra precautions either. 
 Any beginner to intermediate hardening tips?
 Would it be worth paying someone some beer money to do some quick easy pentest stuff?

I really want to like Datacrow, it seems like exactly what I'm looking for, but I can't really find any sort of tutorials/wikis/guides outside of the in-software help menu. Which, while extensive, is difficult for me to read through and doesn't seem to answer a lot of questions.
 If any of you know of a resource that might be of use to me, please share. 
 And if anyone can help me out with my two biggest questions right now, that'd be great: one, is there any kind of dark mode? I've looked through the color/view settings and while I've found some options, the large center fields remain white and it's hurting my eyes. Two, how are individual tags separated? Brackets or something? Because ultimately, that's what I really want from a catalog system, the ability to search and filter by tags and I can't figure out how to separate them so they're usable

Our primary focus is to preserve the game's history by archiving missing versions of the game, as well as other content such as screenshot, videos, mods, maps etc. We made a post on this over a year ago but I thought it would be a good idea to renew the appeal.
 We have also relatively recently been featured in numerous articles thanks to our efforts with finding a particularly rare build of the game. Example: https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-archivists-have-found-their-holy-grail/

I'm interested in archiving a ton of art (nothing nsfw FYI) so I can have it all in one place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally published on Gardens
 This guide walks you through creating a live chat for your website using a self-hosted app called Chatwoot.
 Deploy Chatwoot to your own machine or sign up for the hosted version
 You will first need to set up your Chatwoot instance. There's a guide on how to self-host in the official docs. If you feel like testing without deploying a self-hosted version, go to the official website and create an account. 
 Configure the website channel
 Go to "Settings", then "Inboxes". After clicking “inbox” then clicking on “Add inbox”, a wizard process will guide you through the steps to set up your website. Click on “Website” and enter your website's details, such as:
  
Website Name
 Website Domain
 Widget Color
 Welcome heading And other data
  
Adding an inbox in Chatwoot
 Selecting the website channel
 Configuring your website
 Set up agents and install the website code
 You can select yourself as an agent to get the messages in your inbox. Then, copy the code and paste it into your website following the instructions. You would usually want to add it to the head or the body tag in your HTML, on the top level of your website structure.
 ​
 Copying the live chat snippet to paste into your website code
 The result
 A website live chat widget that customers can use to contact you directly from your website. With the self-hosted version, data is stored directly on your machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 What anti-spam protection are you using and how it's working for you ?
 My config for Incoming:
 I am using ASSP + 2 x Postfix as in this picture https://sourceforge.net/p/assp/wiki/ASSP_Advanced_Workflow/attachment/mime.png
 For now it's working ok but the internet domain is young so no spam yet.
 Even so, I'm looking also for additional protection since ASSP has only some of the protections mention here at Automated techniques for email administrators: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques
 So I'm looking to add Spamassasin to the "chain" at least for the Checksum-based filtering, Hashcash, e.t.c.
 Anybody tried this combination "chain" ?
 Fot Outgoing:
 For now I have none but I'm looking at PolicyD: https://wiki.policyd.org/
 Do you have other suggestions ?
 P.S. I have activated: DKIM, SPF, DMARK, PTR=banner, SSL/TLS, no open relay and the rest that comes default in ASSP also I found my static public IPv4 in one blacklist from over 100 and remove it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying out many, many different photo setups for my photography hobby but I can't seem to find one that really suits my exact needs. For photos from a phone with photosync, its an easy choice, but for more involved photo editing, it doesn't seem like theres a good solution.
 My biggest need/want is Transferrable metadata
  
I want to be able to move the metadata of files in and out of services so Im not locked into an app. If Photoprism dies tomorrow, I don't want to have to redo all my tagging and rating in Piwigo (for example)
  
Id love to be able to Edit photos in DarkTable/another app, and then have the data populate to a web frontend for viewing. 
 Right now, I use Piwigo and Love the granularity of it, but all of the tagging/album creation is done 'in app', and means that if piwigo goes away, or a new better solution arrives, I have to redo it all again in the new setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone here compared XMPP transports to Matrix birdges? Or even just tried XMPP transports in the last year or two? I'm mainly thinking Facebook Messenger, Discord, MS Teams (without admin access, I know it's a stretch).
 I'm looking for something that will get me down to a single app and an f-droid only phone. I've been thinking of running a synapse server, but it still seems like it has a few too many rough edges and requires a fair bit of active monitoring. XMPP wonderfully boring and stable, but I don't know if they're fully featured enough that they wouldn't get in the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some types of information that you want to be highly protected, but at the same time easily accessible and easily backed up. For example ssh keys, backup OTP codes, backups of password manager files etc.
 One way is to add all such sensitive information to a folder on the local disk, then move it to an encrypted archive. This offers good protection and is easy to back up, but it is not easy to add new information. I think the better option is an encrypted folder in a self-hosted Seafile installation. Seems to be well-protected and easy to add new information. What do you think about this? Or do you know other self-hosted applications to save such information?

 But this one looks and sounds so much better. (360p)

 Do they downgrade quality? Were those videos better before? Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Huge fan of the sub. I'm trying to gain a better understanding of those of you who use a cloud service to hoard, whether you have been grandfathered into an unlimited storage deal or not. 
 1) Wouldn't it be more practical to use an on-prem storage solution? I feel like the cost of a cloud service would eventually hit the point to where simply buying your own storage would become more economical. 
 2) Do you still feel you are in complete control and own your data? It's hard for me to imagine trusting someone else to maintain all of my data for me. 
 3) I am currently visiting outside of the US (my home country) and I use a Synology 1821+ to house about 70TBs of my data. The upload/download times are terrible. How long does it take you to upload or bring your data back down? I understand your internet service will play a large part in this, but it seems like it would take a long time to upload a single 4k REMUX that is >50GB. 
 4) How often are you accessing the data? Is it for archival purposes or are you regularly accessing it? 
 Thanks in advance!

 After a few days, I liked the idea and started to use it, but soon I started to find things that I didn't like so much (no 2FA, no offline...) so I started doing what I always do, looking for its self- hosted alternative.
 Until now I have found Obsidian, Affine and AppFlowy, all of them announce that they are the best alternative for notion. I see them very nice but similar and instead of trying several weeks each of them, I come here to ask your opinions. Which one would you recommend?
 ​
 EDIT: So many options! Now I am even more confused hahaha
 Usually there is two or three best alternatives from proprietary applications...but it seems there is no clear winner with this one.

So let's here it for 2022 before the buying spree starts, what tool do you prefer?

 Alex here with another update on Immich.
 It is October already, the autumn is here, and I hope you are all enjoying the cool weather before the cold gets here (You see, I have lived in America long enough that the first thing that comes before any conversation is about the weather :P)
 This update includes many QoS improvements for the app. The important one is fixing some critical security bugs. Thanks to Huntr.dev and their researchers for helping with testing and reaching out to notify us of the vulnerability.
 We finally removed the Mapbox dependency. It was used for getting the location's name (city, state, province, country…etc.) of the photos/videos based on encoded GPS information. Immich now has that functionality baked in, so you don't have to worry about any part of…]]></summary>

Is there any restrictions on this unit that would prevent me from continuing expanding it? As it sits it works entirely fine for my use (Plex Storage). The unit has been upgraded from its 2GB RAM to 4GB.
 Any advice would be helpful thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi-professional video editor here.
 In 2016 I was working on a documentary project that involved a lot of footage. I wanted a secure way to back up all of these assets. After a ton of research I ended up purchasing an mLogic mTape Thunderbolt 2 LTO-6 Ultrium External Tape Drive. This was especially attractive at the time because the Thunderbolt 2 interface promised speed and it worked with my Mac.
 After purchase I filled a total of 14 x 2.5 TB tapes.
 Project finished a few years later. Fortunately I was able to complete all my work without any mishaps.
 A few weeks ago, though, I decided to review my tapes to see if I still needed all of that data.
 4 of the 14 tapes (28%) are unreadable.
 As I said, my work on this project was completed a long time ago and, thankfully, this data is no longer essential.
 However, the experience has left me wondering:
 Is this a typical failure rate for LTO tapes (all high-quality FujiFilm LTO Ultrium 6 Data Cartridges)
  
 I can’t imagine this IS typical - since everything I’ve read about tape backup touts it as the most reliable of all backup systems - but assuming it is, what other possible explanations could account for the failures?
  Is there anything that can be done to salvage the failed tapes?
  
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll spare a lot of the details on how this works, but the still-long-gist is: Ubuntu home server runs VirtualBox Windows VM. Windows VM runs an application that allows the screen to be casted to the Nintendo Switch. The Windows application connects to the local IP of the Nintendo Switch( in this case, 192.168.230.1) Everything works fine locally. The developer of the application is no longer working on the project and I can't find any contact information. Nobody else has done this before as far as I know. 
 The Switch is listening for a connection on port 2222-2224(3 ports for various things). Locally, awesome. I want to be able to connect to my home servers VM on 5G data, hotels, etc. So I can't port forward my phone data, or a hotels router..I tried running an OpenVPN instance, connecting to it on my switch, so they're on the same network.. but in this case, my Switch is connected to my hotspot, and still doesn't seem to be able to listen on the ports.. Hope this isn't too unrelated, and if it is I'll take it down. If anyone has any ideas, let me know!

 Is there any good way to pack an entire website crawl into a single file?
 I've been crawling with wget, but it bothers me a bit that all the images and js and crap "polutes" my filesystem. I'd like a website to be contained into a single file that could simply be opened in a browser.
 I've found singleFile, which is cool (packs a webpage into only one html file), and has recently added crawling options for entire websites, but in those case the fact that then the browser has to open a 500MB html file slows things down to a crawl understandingly.
 Is there anything that can do that, ie, basically pack an entire crawl into a single file that can easily be opened in a browser (without having to unpack)? Basically a .cbz equivalent but for websites

 so I've saved a lot of posts and only recently found out that there is a limit of 1000 posts until they starting to disappear.
 So I've requested my data at reddit and it seems like all the posts are there but I'm not entirely sure as I'm apparently not a lot over the limit (there are a bit over 1000 saved posts showing up in the data log they sent me)
 So my question: Does anyone else have experiences with this, maybe someone who saved a lot more than 1000 posts, could you recover your saved posts via data request?

 This is some really frustrating downtime, and so I'm on the lookout for a cost effective way for 7 people to have a folder that's about 200GB shared between us all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a 4 disk ZFS raid 10 setup for over 8 years that has been rock solid... 30TB usable storage that's mostly movies/tv shows and more recently I have begun to consider switching my implementation towards reducing power consumption (disk spun up time) since anyone accessing a single plex for 1 or 2 media streams cause all of my 4 disks to be active all the time. 
 UNRAID seems like a good compromise that could help by only keeping the disks with the actual file stored in use that need to be while keeping a parity disk (which seems like it would only be able to tolerate a single disk failure at a time; two data disks failing at once in the array seems like it would be catastrophic for unraid). 
 I'm wondering if anyone has any horror stories or advice to share about this? ZFS has been very very good to me over the years. There is no doubt that I could keep things the same but after awhile it seems like I could be able to use storage tiering (dedicated cache, merged filesystem) with UNRAID plus reducing power consumption by turning down the 24/7 four disk array active most of the time due to some minor I/O activity.
 My workload is primarily Plex media server, NFS/SMB. Going to UNRAID for everything could work; but I could also do a unraid hybrid setup with 2 disks ZFS mirror for my documents and photos while leaving the movies+tv files in other disks (this would increase my hdd count from 4 to 5 though due to parity needs)... a third option (probably very time consuming) is openmediavault + https://github.com/45Drives/autotier + ZFS (on each disk, simply to get the ability to 'zfs send/receive' to backup to another zfs server nightly)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DISCLAIMER: I am not Cisco savvy. I am just getting a homelab set up so that I can start to study for the CCNA.
 I am trying to SSH in to a Cisco 3850 switch so that I can do configuration changes without going through the console port. I have it working where I can access it on the same vlan as the device I am on, but I want to work on setting it up over a management vlan using the MGMT port on the back of the switch. I have tried a lot of the guides I have found on Google but I am not having any luck on being able to get SSH working through the management port.
 My current setup is this:
 OPNsense router/firewall
 3850 switch
 3560CX switch
 My desktop PC on VLAN 10 (192.168.10.200)
 My laptop on VLAN 10 at home (192.168.10.201) and VLAN 69 while on VPN (10.10.69.4)
 Here is the relevant config I have on the 3850 so far: https://pastebin.com/6zspQaXW
 For OPNsense, I have the 3850 management port in igb0 of the router and Gi1/0/1 trunked in to port igb1 of the router. Right now, the management VLAN 42 is set to pass all traffic as a firewall rule but do plan on restricting it to only SSH and TFTP traffic in the future.
 Is there something I am missing or does someone have anything to add to get this to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a thought I had. I can't decide where I want my cluster to go next.
 I currently have a 4 node k3s cluster on Raspberry Pi 4s. It used to be 3 masters but a recent update screwed up etcd latency so I've had to go down to a dedicated single master.
 I used to run rook ceph for storage. I really liked how it "just worked™" and I could mess with the cluster all day and not worry about data loss. Adding disks was so simple, just plug in a blank disk and it sucks it up. It doesn't natively support arm though so it was hacky and hard to update.
 I moved to Longhorn, but longhorn has a lot of issues. I have to constantly babysit it.
 I want to move to an x86 cluster, ideally with 3 masters and room to expand workers. If each node had a boot dive and space for a secondary drive for rook ceph to use, that would be awesome. There are some good HP, Dell and Lenovo options but I don't know which would be best.
 Everyone's workload is different. What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of right now, I have approx 600 GB of personal files (documents, pictures, videos, code, etc.). It's not that well organized and I can probably shrink it (a lot) down. But I'm working on that.
 As of right now I have 2x 1tb portable drives (HDD), I keep one of them always with me and once in a month I manually copy/sync the files to the second one.
 I plan on having one plugged into a RPI 24/7 and setup a samba share. Then make a script so that I can plug in the second drive and it will automatically copy everything to it. It sends an email notification when done (so I know when I can disconnect the drive). The drive will be stored offline at my friend's house, so I have to go there and pick it up and bring it back everytime (which is fine for me, I come there regularly).
 To copy everything I'm probably going to use rsync with the -b flag (=incremental backups). One folder containing all the up-to date files. If a file has changed it will move the old file to a folder with the current date as name and update the file in the "up-to date folder" with the new contents. Same for deleting (moving to the current date folder).
 So before running the script:  /backup/files/test content: test1 
 Then change test1 to test2
 After running the script: ``` /backup/2022-10-08/test content: test1
 /backup/files/test content: test2 ```
 Do you have any tips/recommendations?
 Also, should I include cloud storage in my backup plan? Or maybe get a VPS with a lot of storage? I've been avoiding cloud storage since encryption is a must for me.

 I've been processing ArchiveTeam's YouTube discussions dataset into something more workable than the unwieldy raw JSON responses saved from YouTube, and I would like to share it to anyone who's interested in the data. This all started when a reddit user asked if their channel's discussion tab was saved, and I challenged myself into processing this dataset for fun. Here's some code that I wrote for this, if anyone is curious.
 Hopefully someone can find a good use for this dataset!
 The dataset is in newline-delimited JSON, divided by comment year (2006-2021), and compressed with ZSTD. Each line represents a single comment.
 Some fun stats:
  
23.1 GB compressed (97.6 GB uncompressed)
 2.1 TB of compressed WARCs processed (~16 TB uncompressed)
 245.3 million comments
 32.3 million…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a home server that's running a number of different services. Some of them are typical web servers each running in their own Docker container, with nginx delegating web requests to the right server based on subdomain. Others are non-web services running on a specific port. (e.g. OpenVPN, ssh, a game server, etc.)
 What I'd like to do is prioritize each service so that they all get a certain percentage of my total bandwidth, depending on which services are active and using bandwidth. This however includes differentiating between the different web servers and the non-web services, which makes it tricky.
 Here's an example:
  
https​://foo.mydomain.com has a priority of 6
 OpenVPN has a priority of 3
 ssh has a priority of 2
 https​://bar.mydomain.com has a priority of 1
 all uncategorized outgoing traffic (such as normal user web traffic) has a priority of 1
  
...therefore if all four are uploading at once, foo.mydomain.com gets twice the upstream bandwidth as OpenVPN, three times as much bandwidth as ssh, and six times as much as bar.mydomain.com or regular user web traffic.
 Further, if any these services or web servers are being accessed on my LAN, then I don't want there to be any bandwidth limiting at all. ~(So I think that excludes being able to use limit_rate directive in my nginx configuration.)~ edit: Nope, I figured out how to use limit_rate depending on source IP.
 I know this kind of thing can be done at the router level with the right QoS feature, except that kind of QoS is based on what port the traffic is coming through. In the case of web servers, it's all coming through on port 443 so I can't use that to distinguish between them!
 Is there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! We're a small triathlon club, and I'm looking for a self-hosted shared calendar where all the members can add their own races/competitions, and any other member can add itself as attender, no need to send any invitation. For example:
 If I've a race in 2 months, I add this race on this shared calendar. Other member has the same race, and go to this shared calendar to add it. When see this race is already created (by me), just add itself as attender. If other member are looking for some race in few weeks/months, and see in a race there is already 2 people, maybe just helps to decide to sign in to this race too (and add itself as attender).
 I tried the Nextcloud calendar, but I think only has attenders if already has been invited. One approach can be every attender just add the name into a comments section, but will be more visual to use the "attenders" section.
 Is there any similar calendar to do this? Maybe something like Eventbrite, but integrated in a self-hosted platform like Nextcloud to manage users...
 Thanks a lot!

 I have only one issue that I couldn't manage to find a solution for even after trying everything.

Samsung A73 phone I get an unreachable error. I tried with a Motorola android phone, my pc and an Android tablet they all connect except this A73. I tried everything resting the phone, the router and assigning static IP etc but nothing works the phone connect to the internet fine but not locally not matter what. Any help would be appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm using a self built server running Unraid. I've been spending the day playing around with DNS-filtering. Long story short, I ended up using Technetium DNS server because it allowed me to filter domains and also use DoT (DNS over TLS). However, being the paranoid internet user that I am, I feel the need to test whether the DoT is actually working, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.
 I've tried this tool and I'm a bit confused by the results https://1.1.1.1/help
 When I use DoT with Quad9 it tells me that my DNS requests are not encrypted, but if I instead use Cloudflare's DoT it says everything is working. Since the tool is made by Cloudflare I am wondering whether the results are accurate. I would prefer it if I could use the Quad9 DoT.
 Are there any good (impartial) tools for testing DoT?
 Edit: I realised that it might be good to also include that I've set the Technetium DNS server as my default DNS in my router, so my entire network should be covered by it.

 What I'd like to do, is move them to a seperate server that has room for three separate backup drives in it. and I'd like to be able to access it just like a regular drive on my main PC. This way, I won't have to copy backup data every month onto my synology device. one less step.
 any ideas? I'd like it to be windows 11 based so, if I need too, I can just pop it back into my main pc without having to worry about special formats.

 Hope you have a nice day ahead!
 Anybody here got Seafile in Docker working? 
 I currently have a Seafile instance not Dockerized that works just fine, however I would like to move it to a Docker container.
 I followed the migration doc of Seafile but that does not work.
 By checking the error it tries to connect to MYSQL on localhost which is NOT what I have in the conf file. I think this showed once only.
 I'm guessing it cannot read the conf folder or maybe it's the service URLs in the config that creates the issue?
 I double checked the folder structure and it seems fine. I changed the permissions to root, my user or Seafile which all lead to the same result.
 When doing a curl on the exposed IP and port of Seafile I get a Bad Gateway error from Nginx inside the container.
 Can someone help out? 
 Thanks!

 Cherry UI Dark Mode
 Cherry is an open source self-hostable bookmark service
 I've spent several months of my off-work time crafting it. It’s built with SvelteKit and uses SQLite for data store.
 It supports full text search, powered by SQLite fts5. You can also import bookmarks from Pocket, Chrome/Firefox/Safari bookmark export and CSV files.
 It has a simple, and probably quite opinionated, web UI. So It’s probably not for everyone, but I do wish there are people enjoy use it as I do.
 Please give it a try and share your feedbacks. Happy self-hosting!

I combined all the RAM and 750W power supplies into one machine, put 6x 3.5" SATA disks in it, and sold off the other. It's been running without issues until around two weeks ago, when it started abruptly powering off.
 I found that one of the heatsink retainers had broken, so the heatsink tilted up off the CPU. Figured this was a pretty clear case of thermal shutdown, so I removed that proc entirely, figuring I could run on the remaining one until I figured out what to do longer-term -- swap the motherbord, replace it, or something else.
 The problem lessened in frequency, but didn't stop. It went from staying up for ~30 minutes to ~3 hours.

I started out with a 1TB external drive that I thought would last me forever (oh how naive I was), then a 4TB one, and then I finally got serious with a 4-bay NAS loaded up with 6TB drives in RAID 5. However, I've now gotten to the point where it's just a matter of time before even that is not enough.
 Since this is the first time I'm properly in the situation of having to upgrade four separate drives, I want to make sure I don't screw myself over. What sort of prices do you all consider good, particularly for 8 or 12TB drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to this page on the Seagate website, connecting SATA drives to SAS controllers is possible, but not the other way around. That's fine. That's what I want to do.
 I have a mirrored RAIDZ of 18TB SATA drives in my Debian VM, currently using a cheap PCIe SATA controller passed through to the VM in Proxmox. However, this is causing the VM to take literally a full minute and a half to boot, and I don't like that. I have been informed that this is likely due to the VM trying to boot from the SATA controller before it gives up and actually boots from the boot drive, which is strange because the boot drive is given priority in the VM settings.
 Whatever the cause, I was told that a decent LSI HBA like the 9211-8i with a firmware flash into IT mode would solve this problem. Indeed, I was informed that the 9211-8i is the go to card for homelabbers to connect their RAIDs to. Old faithful, if you will. So I bought a 9211-8i that is already flashed to IT mode.
 It is a SAS card, and I cannot seem to physically connect the SATA drives to the card. Is there some adapter I need? Is this actually not possible and the link I posted is bullshit? I have done a bunch of googling and I keep finding people asking about connecting SAS drives to SATA controllers and the odd other article about how SATA drives and SAS controllers are compatible, but nothing about how to actually do it.
 Can someone please shed some light on this for me?
 EDIT: Wrong card.

It was a WD80EFAX 8tb, but from my reading online, it seemed to be the exact same drive as the WD80EFBX, just reporting now as 7200rpm instead of "5400rpm class", plus it was a steal at $110 brand new.
 Well the drive is reporting much slower write speeds than my other 4 drives in my Synology. The reported benchmark speeds of my drives are below. Is this something I should be concerned about when I add it as a SHR drive? I can also return the drive for a full refund, but I would need to find another good deal on a WD Red Plus still... Thanks in advance!
  
WD WD80EFBX #1 - Read IOPS 200, Latency 14.6ms | Write IOPS 774, 1.4ms
 WD WD80EFBX #2 - Read IOPS 208, Latency 14.3ms | Write IOPS 851, 1.3ms
 WD WD80EFBX #3 - Read IOPS 207, Latency 14.3ms | Write IOPS 842, 1.4ms
 WD WD80EFBX #4 - Read IOPS 202, Latency 14.5ms | Write IOPS 815, 1.4ms
 WD WD80EFAX NEW - Read IOPS 212, Latency 14.2ms | Write IOPS 469, 2.2ms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be selling my main computer in favour of building a new one next week. There will be a period of time when I will be stuck with my laptop but still need to access my data on my SSD and HDD. 
 I've thought of getting a SATA->USB dock, but I've read some reviews and they mention GPT corruption. 
 My current idea is to shift around the data between the HDD and SSD so that I can get everything I will need for work on the SSD and buy a regular enclosure for it for the time being (and use it as an external drive). While the HDD sits tight until I get a PC.
 Having both drives available would be ideal though.
 What would you guys suggest? The time frame where I will be without a desktop will probably be around 2 to 3 months. What's the cost-effective solution here?

I think it is an incredibly valuable book which I can buy a physical copy of but I think a digital copy would be incredibly valuable. It is out of print and very hard to find! 
 https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=46C0F8FB4D55280A4CFBAE2669AADF8E
 I was wondering if anyone could help point me in the right direction for getting it accurately converted to text. Ideally raw text so I can convert it into a high quality epub.
 I've tried Google Drive to Docs, did not work well at all.
 I've tried tesseract and it was very inaccurate. 
 I've tried Adobe Acrobat pro version and it didn't work much better than tesseract.
 The best result I've gotten was with Abbyy but I was only able to convert like 50 pages and it seems silly to pay $80 for a month of the service to convert a single book...
 Was just wondering if anyone is willing to help me out on this. Maybe there is some preprocessing I am missing? Very new to this.
 Thanks!

I have a GbE network card attached (pic 1), do i plug in Ethernet into it or use the ports on the motherboard?
 
I have something attached which has two sd card in it, what is it and what is it used for? (pic 2)
 
Is one 32gb ram stick enough for plex transcodings and other light weight services? (pic 3)
 
The rail holder on the server is damaged, will it hold properly? (pic 4)
 
The first hdd caddy is not coming out, it used to pull out but now it doesn't, its stuck. (pic 5)
 
Do I need to connect iDRAC separately since it has its own ethernet port?
 
 Thank you for your time and answers.

I’ve seen some modem-router combo units that have rj11 ports to connect a phone line, but I haven’t had any luck finding dedicated modems with this feature.

 I have a networked drive (Server: Windows 10 Pro, Client: MacOS Monterey) that is extremely slow (15-20 MB/s R / W) via SMB 3.
 It is running SMB_3.1.1 as verified when I run smbutil statshares on the Mac.
 I have tried multiple fixes unsuccessfully (disabling SMB Signing, among other random recommendations).
 ——————————
 SERVER | Windows 10 Pro
 5900X
 32GB
 PRIMARY STORAGE: 2TB NVME
 NETWORKED STORAGE: WD Black RE 1TB HDD (CrystalDisk = R: 120 MB/s / W: 114 MB/s)
 ​
 CLIENT | MacOS Monterrey
 Macbook Pro 2021
 4TB Onboard NVME
 ​
 ROUTER
 Homehub 4000 (ISP issued but is a their brand new flagship model)
 ​
 CONNECTION
 Wireless (I do not have the means of running a wired connection, even for tests).
 TX / RX (Transmit Rate) on both Server and Client is 1200 Mbps
 I ran iperf, if that helps, with Windows as the server, but I don’t really know how to read it. See results here:
 https://imgur.com/a/jxAKmBf
 ——————————
 I’m thinking of shooting a bullet in the dark and setting up TrueNAS via Hyper-V to see if it solves it, but that would require extra time and effort so I am looking for guidance before I go ahead with it.
 Many thanks.

Unraid Server
 Case: Fractal Design Define 7
 Drives: 14 hard drives, 2 SSDs
  
The interior of the case will be filled with those expanded foam packets to support the CPU cooler and other bracketry.
 The Unraid USB drive will be backed up and stored in Google Cloud. The USB drive will be with me in my bag.
 The bottom 4 hard drives are backup drives for the main array in a BTRFS file system which will be removed and carried with me on the plane.
 The questionable part: The remaining 10 drives will be left in the case which will be in the case's original packaging.(Molded foam blocks and all that.) Which will be palletized with the rest of the equipment and shipped by sea for one to two months. So it should be have less direct handling since it will be moved around as part of its pallet.
 I do have a second option of shipping this one computer case box by air as long as it is no more than 35kg. However, it may experience more direct handling by the shipping company.(Kuroneko Yamato)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I have a few services in my homelab that are reliant upon the apache2 web server.
 There were a few configuration vulnerabilities flagged by my vulnerability scanner with guidance to update the values in httpd.conf ( /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) in the case of ubuntu 20.04 that i'm running
 I made those changes such as modifying the following values
 (Options None) for root directory
 TraceEnable off 
 ServerTokens ProductOnly 
 ServerSignature off 
 LimitRequestline 512 LimitRequestFields 100 LimitRequestFieldsize 1024 LimitRequestBody 102400 
 ​
 I've however stumbled upon some comments since then that modifying these values directly in the apache2.conf file isn't a good practice as that file can occasionally be replaced during a package update and conf.d is preferable. I've also read some conflicting information that the conf.d directory is deprecated
 ​
 ​
 What is currently considered best practice for making persistent config changes such as setting TraceEnable off ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgive me if this is a stupid question - I got my start a few years ago on r/homelab but have continued expanding with more drives (currently 8TB WD Red, 8TB WD White, and an 18TB Seagate Exos). 
 Also installed a Dell H310 6Gbps SAS HBA w/ LSI 9211-8i P20 IT (from the Art of Server) since I’d essentially tapped all the SATA ports on my motherboard. 
 I have everything in a Fractal Node 804, since it has so many drive bays. Eventually, I’d like to move to a rack mounted server (as I continue to add), but the Dell/HP servers I see all have caps at like 8TB/drive?
 Is there a different option - or an empty rack chassis that I can install my own CPU/RAM, etc., into? Then I could continue to run OMV and just keep adding drives as necessary?
 New to this (still) and just thinking down the line.

My plan is to use this build as replacement for my former NAS and do some virtualization stuff. So I will try and go for TrueNAS Scale as my OS of choice. But I have a problem setting up my Dell Perc H310.
 My plan is to set up two separate ZFS pools (one with the 4TB drives and one with the 146Gb drives). To achieve this I connected the 4TB drives directly to the Onboard SATA controller of the server. The integrated SAS caddy is wired to the onboard RAID controller (HP SmartArray P410i) which cannot be used in HBA mode to pass the drives to the system in order to use any form of software RAID. So gain access to the drives directly I needed an real HBA to replace this function.
 I ordered an Dell Perc H310, as it is the most common one around here. The setup should be pretty easy compared to other models. But it needs to be flashed into IT-mode manually as mentioned in this guide. As I am struggling with setting up the proper boot drive, because an security feature of my server prevents me from booting of USB drives, I came across a different problem: My server won't boot anything while the HBA is plugged in (any port). The guide told me to wrap some pins with electrical tape to get around this problem, but it won't. The startup screen comes up as normal, but it won't boot my disc or any bootable drive. Across multiple forums people stated that wrapping is key - but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. As soon as I remove the card from my system everything works fine. 
 Does anyone experienced something similar or is there an tweak in the BIOS or something? I appreciate all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there hoarders,
 first of all, I'd like to drop a big THANK YOU. I read the wiki and some posts and it occurred to me that I was, in fact, not backing up everything I got. In the background I'm now in a bit of a frenzy, ripping CDs, DVDs and games (including keys) I only got on optical media. I mean, what if I dropped a dishwasher on that box when my fiance and I move out?
 Speaking of which, right now I'm limited to an old (but entirely fine) external HDD and an S3 Glacier archive I push some things to. My fiance and I want to step up our game. Right now we share our flat with two friends and have little space and no LAN ports or bandwidth to spare. Seriously. Our network topology could only be worse if we managed to jam a loop in there.
 So, we made a plan. And I'd very much appreciate if you could look it over real quick and give some feedback:
  
Buy a couple identical NAS drives and chuck them in external USB cases for now to save space. Subscribe to Backblaze for a cloud backup solution that I won't have to sell my first-born for once the wild hoarding ride goes into overdrive.
 Hoard data separate from one another for now to leave our LAN in its current miserable state.
 Once we move, buy another two NAS drives identical to the ones already present and put them in an actualy NAS system in RAID 1.
 Copy our data to the NAS, wipe the external drives and put them in the NAS.
  
Additionally, pray to bit almighty that our temporary solution doesn't implode. Thank you in advance!
 P.S.: While writing the above, I discovered that my Unreal Tournament 3 disc ate it. Serves me right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say a text file initially said "hello" and a few days after the full backup was changed to say "hello world." Does backup software generally store the incremental backup as "hello world" or "world?" The former is easier to implement in programming but wastes disk space. The latter is more space efficient but requires restoring the previous version through all previous incremental backups and then doing a file diff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, 
 I am hoping that someone here can help or point me in the right direction (I know it may not be an exact fit for this sub). I am looking at digitizing my old negatives and slides and need some advice, as although I have been doing a lot of reading up on the subject, I am getting to the point where I am feeling that I am in over my head. This may be a long post.
 First off, I have a range of undeveloped film (35mm, APS, 110, a few old disposables and even a couple of film disks), as well as negatives and slides (Kodachrome).
 MY questions: The general consensus seems to be that the Plustek 8100 and Epson v600 Photo are the minimum requirement for current gen to achieve decent results, my question here is whether this is still accurate as a lot of the information seems to be from many years ago?
 I have looked through a lot of the standalone and flatbed options, and most seem to be 35mm only, however this seems to only be a limitation of the included mounts, with aftermarket mounts available for the likes of the Plustek standalone and Epson flatbeds. I guess I really just wanted to confirm that this is the case, and I am not missing something?
 It also seems that if this is the case, it should be relatively easy to rig something up for film where it would not warrant the cost of buying an adapter, even if only able to scan one image at a time. I cannot seem to find much information on people actually doing this though, so it may not be viable in practice?
 Well, I guess not as many questions as I thought... I suppose I really just want to find some confirmation from those who know about these things that picking up one of the above scanners is what I need. After I have the scans, I am much more confident with digital manipulation in PS/GIMP than I am with getting them digitized in the first place, and I know whatever way I go at this, it is a long-term project.
 Appreciate any input or suggestions!
 ​
 Cheers,
 ​
 A.

 I seriously need to keep track of it all. So what I'm looking for is something like a simple webpage that I can add a list of stuff. Something that looks good and isn't just a load of blue links on a webpage. That also scales to mobile/tablet screens.
 I could set each service up with fancy domain names, but I'd still need a directory of sorts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need help managing over 50,000 photographs. How can I easily go through them?
 My setup: I have a 10Tb external drive I use as a backup. The files are all in the root folder, sorted by Date Taken. (Maybe the photos should not be in the root so that my drive can open before it starts loading them?) The computer I have is over 10 years old with an AMD APU, and it seems to struggle with loading them all. I was given an older SSD which has increased the speed of Windows significantly. I am not at the PC now, but likely have 16Gb of DDR3.
 Is the bottleneck coming from my processor, or possibly the RAM? My mission is to compile all my photos of my cat, and to also get the photos of all the other animals we have had around our home. Viewing large thumbnails would be preferred but due to the quantity of photos it is a very laborious process. I also don't want to stress the external drive too much. (There's not AI that can identify animal photos is there?)
 ​
 Additionally, I am wondering if there is a way to 'label' each photo, i.e. this photo contains photos of my garden and contains a searchable tag of 'garden' or my cat 'lily', or 'wedding', 'raccoons', 'basement', etc.
 If anyone has any ideas I would be interested in hearing them. Thanks.

 I have used Rundeck in the past, but seems overkill. Anything else out there that can do something like this?

 The only thing i'm missing is possibility to listen on the go video files downloaded from different sources and having lections-talking wise content like. I.e. there only audio is having a sense and traffic cost, so the selfhosted server with realtime transcoding mkv/mp4/avi to mp3 will be just best solution.
 Trying to get Airsonic do that for me, unfo can't force them to look at the different folders and get out video to mp3 on the fly. Help please if you know how, unless there are better solution available.
 Any recommendation from community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My self-hosting journey started about two years ago when I discovered both Kubernetes and this amazing sub. Since then I have hosted many applications on Kubernetes. However I found the process not as easy as it could be and for 6 months I have been working on a tool to facilitate the deployment of applications on a Kubernetes cluster → https://openlizz.com.
 I just released a first version of this tool. I'm already using this tool to manage my own cluster and applications, but it's still at an early stage. In addition, the number of compatible applications is currently limited, but I plan to add more soon. The goal of the project is to make self-hosting on Kubernetes easier and more accessible.
 If you are interested, there are two tutorials that show how it can be use: https://openlizz.com/docs/tutorials.
 As I said, this project is in its early stages and I'm very interested in any feedback, comments, or even maybe contributions.
 GitHub: https://github.com/openlizz/lizz
 Looking forward to discussing in the comments :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current NAS has two pools of two drives, and assuming I don't change the file structure, it's easy to use robocopy and let it skip existing files during backup as both pool and backup drive are the same size.
 When I replace this NAS I'm thinking of using a single pool of drives instead, and let the NAS handle large directories for me.
 What I wonder in this case is, how do you do backups for offline storage?
 The pool size is most likely going to be larger than the backup drives, so as I see it, NAS files might end up on different backup drives, so you'd not be able to skip a lot of files.
 Is there a backup solution that accounts for this, other than cloud storage?

 I'm interested in getting them working with motioneye.
 That is, in fact, done.
 But I was curious about the fact that the chipset changes from all winner, mstar and hi3518.
 I was curious about how easy/hard it would be to 
 1.) Create docker build environments for each chip set, 2.) Unify some builds so that it supports all the different chipsets. 
 I've done a little (poor) work at www.github.com/SimonMcN/yi-hack-Allwinner to try and convert the all winner chipset to hi3518.
 I don't know if this is pointless, at the moment it's an intellectual exercise I'm failing with github actions but if someone can explain how I can identify the correct cross compiler prefix without being able to see the files stem in github I'd appreciate it.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The longevity of recordable compact discs (CD-Rs), recordable digital versatile discs (DVD±Rs) and recordable Blu-rays (BD-Rs) is uncertain, leading to a widespread lack of trust by libraries and archives. Research studies, anecdotal information and manufacturers’ literature suggest that the lifetime of recordable optical discs can range from a couple of years to more than 200 years. This Note explores several of the factors that affect whether a disc will fail within a short period or will continue to perform well for many years.

The flapless one has a bit narrower a gap than the flap one though. However the flaps were often causing the drive to get stuck so I just removed them. Isn't anything that's holding a drive in just by the sata connector bad for it? Also do hard drives benefit at all from uasp?

Any help would be much appreciated, I've scoured search engines and similar sites but no luck on finding them even uploaded anywhere else so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running OPNSense in a VM on my server. The motherboard has 2 onboard GBe NICs and one 10/100 (dedicated to the iKVM remote access). I added a 3rd NIC on a PCIE 1x card. The way I have it setup right now is the PCIE NIC connects to the cable modem and is the incoming signal for OPNSense. One of the onboard NICs feeds from the OPNSense VM to the LAN, and the 3rd one is the host OS's NIC.
 I have noticed some weirdness with my internet speeds where it will sometimes drop to almost unusable speeds and a reboot of the VM fixes it. 
 Does anybody think it would be beneficial to offload both the OPNSense VMs NICs to an external card such as this: https://www.newegg.com/intel-e1g42et/p/N82E16833106035 ?

 So long story short few years back i went with Google Nest WiFi and it worked great until Google made some changes and took all setting away so i have zero control over this device. I have 3 of them since it is mesh. Now google also did something with their updates that most 2G WiFi connected devices wont connect and i had to reboot google at lest once a day. to fix this issue i added TP-Link 1GB router and i disabled WAN and 5G and kept only 2G which worked but it was having issues. Since everything is 1G i switched and made TP-Link main unit and Google 2nd this setup worked but now my network is extremely slow and i have keep switching wifi on my laptop back and forth.
 Can someone with more brain power assist here please
 Thanks

 I thought about using caddy, but there is no way to protect the webpage. I know i can use authelia to protect the page, but I'm not sure how I'd pass the login credentials through python when trying to download the fike, if it's even possible to do that.
 I'm a real noob at this, just spitballing. Maybe someone understands what I'm trying to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I post this just because I occasionally see these for sale on r/homelabsales and elsewhere I picked one up (maybe a year ago). Searching about it yielded not much info - thanks Datto /s. It mostly just sat there as I procrastinated downsizing my homelab. Finally getting around to setting up the hardware I discovered NVMe is not recognized by the bios but post POST the OS can see it. This means I could install an OS on the nvme drive, but couldn't boot from it. It's nearly identical to the zotac zbox mi522nano (even sharing the same model name) and their updated bios addresses this issue. I was unable to flash the bios via USB/dos or even via windows. I did some searching to see if I could be lazy about it, but why not just try to flash it with the zotac firmware - 'what could possibly go wrong?'
 Happy to say that using the CH341A (w/ 3.3v mod) and neoprogrammer v2.1.0.19 to flash the zotac bios (Version 2K160308) on the GD25B64C chip did in fact work and after removing the stupid glowing Datto logo and covering it (from inside) with black vinyl tape, you'd now never know it was a datto box and best of all NVMe boot works as well as using the mPCIe slot for my coral board.
 TL;DR flashing zotac firmware on datto s3x1 worked for me to boot from nvme drive. I had to use CH341a flasher and neoprogrammer software. Posting just for those who may find themselves searching for this in the future as I couldn't find even datto firmware update (unsurprisingly).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just built a new 3U ATX rack server with the following specs:
 - Gigabyte X570 Pro Wifi
 - Ryzen 3900X
 - 128GB 3200 DDR4
 - 2x2TB Samsung m.2
 - 2x250GB Samsung SSD (OS drive & cache drive for vsan)
 ​
 The goal is to build another one with matching specs and do a 2 node vSAN build with a 3rd witness node but until then this single node can hold all my VMs I need. 
 This issue im running into is I cannot RAID the m.2 without vSAN on the node (due to a limitation of the X570 mobo). I would have to run two 2TB datastores, which would work but want to RAID them and have a single 4TB datastore. Is there an issue with running a single vSAN node for the time being?Im not worried about data risk, I do daily snapshots with the synology. Once I build the 2nd node I can just add it to vcenter and added it to the vSAN cluster. Would this work or am I better off just running two datastores and migrating everything to the 2nd vSAN node when ready then add the 1st node to the cluster.

 Caution [C5] Current Pending Sector Count : 8

 I know it's bad, but is it catastrophic? I've seen people with 100+ Uncorrectable sectors being warned that any moment their disk may break down, is the case the same in my situation?
 I am only asking because I need to last with this disk as my main only for a fev weeks, then I will upgrade from this 1TB HDD to a 1TB NVMe SSD as my main drive - I will use this HDD only as backup storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not 100% sure this is the exact correct sub but, it's still hoarding related.
 So, I've got a TrueNAS VM setup and I was following a guide on setting up the ARRs which involved creating individual media datasets and linking them to their appropriate app. https://schnerring.net/blog/install-qbittorrent-jackett-lidarr-radarr-sonarr-and-plex-inside-truenas-jails/
 That one actually. The problem is, and I'm only just now realizing this, hardlinks don't work properly with that setup, so my 2+tb of media now occupies 4+tb of space and it's still growing.
 Currently I'm running /mnt/NAS/MEDIA/(dataset for respective app according to the guide)
 My question is, is there a way to somehow juggle the files around while I destroy the datasets? Maybe throw everything up to /MEDIA/, create regular corresponding folders, then move it back?
 Also, if I wiped all but the torrent folder, would ARR pick it back up automatically? Or would I have to do an import?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, since my collections expanded quite substantially over the past year i am nearly out of storage again :/ But this time i am looking for sth that should hopefully last me for the next years. 
 I looked through many cases but most of them are only 24 bay and it feels a bit like wasting space since my rack is also quite full. 
 The case should be:
 - 35+ bays (best would be 48 bay like a Chenbro NR40700)
 - topload for 3.5" bays
 - Standard atx MBs
 - good vibration protection for drives
 - sas 6g (12g would be nice though) backplane
 - ATX Psu would be nice
 - not to loud (fans replaceable) if possible
 - under 1k $ for the case if possible
 So far the only thing that kinda fits this is the Chenbro NR40700 but i havent seen any of them for sale (ebay or reseller / Europe).
 Any recommendations or places where you can still buy those?

 I've been using [Joplin] for some time now. I really like it.
 Nevertheless, I will like to be able to edit folder and files outside Joplin. This means being able to recognize which file is which by having names and folder as well.
 ​
 Do you know any application that is able or resemble to it ? 
 It can be hosted in my server or, as Joplin, be a desktop application that can be linked to my nextcloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got this update (automatically) from the Google Drive macos client which is described here: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/12178485
  
Introduced by Apple in macOS 12.1, File Provider provides native support for accessing cloud-based file systems like Google Drive. Users who stream files will notice slight differences from the previous experience provided by Drive for desktop. 
 [...] 
 To find streaming files: 
  
Open Finder. 
 
On the left, under "Locations," click Google Drive. 
 
 Like before, files are not downloaded until actually used. Files that have not been downloaded yet are marked with a cloud icon. 
 Notes: 
 For advanced use cases (e.g. Terminal), you can find your files under ~/Library/CloudStorage. 
 Items in an application's recent file lists will not open until they are accessed in their new locations through Spotlight search or in Finder. If you have configured applications to explicitly use file paths referencing Drive for desktop’s streaming drive, you will need to manually change these paths to continue accessing them as you did previously. 
 If you previously had configured your content cache to reside on a secondary volume, your content will be moved to the same volume on which your home directory resides.
  
My question is: now the "location" of my GD is named "Google Drive - <email address>" ... is there any way to change this to remove the "Google Drive - " prefix? I find it annoying for various reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm looking to build a budget nas server for video editing and as a media server. 
 I'm looking at older used pcs to start as a base and I'm not really sure what to look for spec and power consumption-wise.
 One i was looking at was 150 for
 I7-9700f CPU
 (2) 2133MHZ DDr 4 
 ASRock B360M/OEM LGA 1151 
 Some Nvidia graphics card 
 The other one I was looking at was for 250
 - Intel Xeon E3 1230 Quad Core CPU
 - 16GB DDR3
 - Gigabyte Z77-DS3H Motherboard
 - GTX 1060 3GB GPU
 - Samsung 840 250GB SSD
 - 1TB Toshiba HDD
 - 430W Thermaltake 80+ Power Supply
 ​
 Is either of these decent?

 I mainly plug in the drive occasionally to just watch whatever I want on command. Not that often though. Probably once or twice a month or less. This is my usage. 
 Right now I have it all stored on an external hard drive (G-Drive) and its held up for about 5 years now. 
 How can I back up my Data to keep it safe for long term storage in case the hard drive fails?
 I heard flash drives have less moving parts so theyre better and that SSDs arent good long term if you don't use them often? Im a noob at this guys please help. What would you do if you were in my situation?
 Much appreciated

 I am tempted towards WD black which is at a steep discount on Amazon:

 However, it seems that it has a proprietary port instead of a usb-c? Shall I go for a external hard drive with usb-c? Are there more competitive/better external hard drives than this?

 So I think it's finally time to create a dedicate post for my personal project KitchenOwl. I've mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.
 KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven't cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.
 If you're interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.
 Why did I create KitchenOwl?
 Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That's when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That's when I decided to just create my own app.
 It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.
 ​
 Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.

With my current internet connection, 15TB's would take a minimum of two months to upload. I am using some seedbox activity an in attempt to upload faster. Seedboxes over a certain TB are not practical cost-wise. The other source will be over Usenet. The usenet process is manual with the use of Newsbin Pro 64. I download articles, I search articles, I download everything under that search term (avoiding the redflags), and then filter through the downloads, eliminating corrupted files by checking the CRC, which is com…]]></summary>

 I have a Synology DS213 with 2 4TB drives currently in RAID1.
 I don't want anymore only 4TB available with parity but just the plain 8TB.
 What do I need to do to achieve this? Do I need to format all?
 Thanks all!

 But outside of looking at it randomly, do you do anything with the data? Feel safe just knowing it's there?
 Do you do any research, projects, mess around in some way? Or is it the journey of being able to fulfilling enough?

 It’s probably the power module, I know.
 While we recover from this nightmare that at the very least (and hopefully only) will put us back 10 days behind schedule, I want to know HOW THE F**K this can happen, and how can I avoid this in the future.
 Any advice?

 As a long-time lurker and superfan of this subreddit, just wanted to throw out a huge thanks for all the sage sysadmin advices I’ve gotten here over the years as I’ve built out my movie collection and servers. Respect!
 To that end, I was curious about the group’s opinions about a few things:
 - Most of my films are 1080p RARBG releases, with the audio encoded in AAC.
 - Is AAC a viable codec for maximum compatibility with a range of devices(receivers)?
 - I’ve considered re-encoding / Downloading my media recently.. to (AC3, DD?)
 So that‘s got me wonderin about how folks feel about downloading h265 movies?
 (I’m after direct-play compatibility for a max range of devices above all other priorities)
 Are peeps still waiting to switch, waiting for AV1 Maturity, etc before upgrading their libraries?.

The disk behaves quite "bursty", eg it works good for a short while, then slows down to a halt for a while, and repeats. https://i.imgur.com/OSqOQen.png
 I searched around and only found typical "disable superfetch" and such results. I'm pretty sure it's nothing wrong with my system, I haven't had this problem before with any other drives.
 Here is the information from CrystalDiskInfo, showing caution on "Current Pending Sector Count". Is it probable I got a bad disk, or what should I do next you guys think? Thanks for any ideas!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am facing a problem with my Nginx config.
 My goal is to have a „utility” server where I can access tools like Umami, Uptime Kuma etc. The preferred way to access Umami Analytics would be via umami.domain.com.
 Expected behaviour should look something like:
 umami.domain.com → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 Current behaviour:
 umami.domain.com → JSON Response (from Nginx Proxy Manager)
 umami.domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 ​
 ​
 Nginx Config
 ​
 Question:
 How can I route my localhost:3000 port to umami.domain.com without specifying a port in the URL?
 ​
 I understand that this might be an error due to my limited understanding of networking and proxying therefore I would appreciate any recommendations for further reading or a basic introduction to networking
 ​
 Tech stack:
  
Docker
 Umami Analytics
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 NameCheap Domain Name
 Small VPS
  
​
 The JSON response: {"status":"OK","version":{"major":2,"minor":9,"revision":18}}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure I've ever seen a deletion quite like this for a videogame. Such a short amount of time before the game was just completely replaced by it's successor. While it is a relatively new game, it still seems like a huge blow to the games preservation community. Is it even possible that someone could have a copy of Overwatch 1 considering the nature of the game? I think it's a very interesting case, maybe it hasn't had too much effect so far, but I'm interested to see how it affects the future. I just hope this does not set a precedent for other game companies, as this would be a terrible practice to start seeing commonplace.

But none of the archive websites I found would display images or videos, only comments, and reddit video downloaders don't work either, because the video is banned. so at some point, I decided to try The Wayback Machine, and, that actually worked. I saw the video appear like normal, BUT, I couldn't watch it, because it was continuously loading. also, the "save post" and "share" options don't work, so I don't know what to do. If anyone knows how to download or watch these anyway, please tell me!

Im going to list the reasons i did it this way, the major one being i just started out with docker recently but i saw 99% of containers run in HTTP or its a PITA to get HTTPS working, i wanted to wrap all my traffic in HTTPS in a very simple way and found…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I am a little new to the world of reverse proxies and, in general, self hosting. In the past I have port forwarded for wireguard and ssh. Just recently, I've managed to setup a free Pbx box and got that all going. Port 443, 80, clearly Ip, and then a udp port range of 10001 to 20000.
 All works but then I thought that it was a little exposing. Nginx proxy manager, vanilla nginx, traefik, not sure it's possible. Standard 443 and 80 is pretty straight forward, however, a port range seemed a little more complex.
 Ssh forwarded through I think is what they call the stream option in nginx. Can that be done in nginx proxy manager too? Reading into it it seems that nginx can do a port range too but I'm just not clear on it.
 Has anyone done this or would be kind enough to offer their two cents?
 Thanks

 With these limited specs is this feasable? Using docker, how many services might this support? The ram sounds really low, especially as my pi4 has 4GB.

I have heard of Authelia and maybe that's what I should use? I am not sure. What would you suggest? Am I even going about securing this the correct way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have a setup where I send my CCTV image to Doods for people detection, whenever a human is detected I send a notification to my phone with the image. What I want to do is also save this file to a directory, for review purpose, so that i can look back and see how many times there something was detected. 
 What I need is a suggestion for a photogallery that can let me see all these images easily. What i am looking for is something simple, I dont need metadata tagging or AI processing in the gallery, just need something that can scroll through all the images , grouped by time ( per day, per week etc ).
 I already have photoprism as the gellery for my actual photos and its just overkill for this purpose.

 Is there a separate application (preferably GUI) for this?
 I’d like to keep the files uncompressed so that I can open them and access files whenever I want to but if that’s not an option, does right clicking on a folder and clicking on Compress “Folder Name” work well?

The only issue is that on startup, I get a few POST errors that I can only bypass by pressing enter. Obviously this is not ideal considering I'm not going to have a keyboard or display attached to this PC. Is there any way to disable these messages? I've looked through all the BIOS settings and I didn't find anything, but I know some manufacturers hide settings behind certain keybinds.
 Is it even worth the hassle or would I be better off just buying one of these generic x99 motherboards so I wouldn't have to deal with any of these issues that come with proprietary parts from old prebuilts?

Also, if anyone can give me tips on getting Mastodon up and running with Docker Compose I would appreciate it, online guides have been lackluster.

(My hope is to be able to edit the html/php files from my Windows computer) I'm running Ubuntu Server 20.04 on a Raspberry Pi 4. When I try to access the webpage, I get the forbidden access message. I have changed apache2.conf and 000-default.conf. I have set the file permissions. Still no dice.
 I am a bit confused as to what the filepath is to my Samba folder. Seems to be /home/ubuntu/share/websites. If anybody has a bright idea I'd love to hear it. I'm probably just doing something stupid but I can't figure it out, and I'm really not sure where else to go for help.
 Thanks in advance for any help with this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an UnRAID server that I used MergerFS to make "shortcuts" as I couldn't make symlinks on UnRAID for some reason.
 This has come to bite me as I'm moving to TrueNAS. 
 I merge many directories this way on boot: 
  /bin/mergerfs -o use_ino,cache.files=partial,dropcacheonclose=true,allow_other,category.create=mfs "/mnt/user/Development/2022/United States Customers" "/mnt/user/Current Projects/USA" 
 If I run the command above before I rsync my data to the new server, all the files will be duplicated on both left and right directories.
 If I don't run the command above before I rsync, I'll have some files in the left side directory, and some in the right side directory. 
 Essentially I want to move/consolidate all files in the original (left side) directory, so I can rsync everything.
 Could anyone please suggest a way to fix this fuck up? Much appreciated. 
 I found mergerfs.consolidate on https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools but I'm not sure of the right syntax or if it's indeed intended to fix this.

 I'm backing up a hard drive to another using Veeam free agent for windows. as a secondary option I'm also syncing the whole hard drive to another using FreeFileSync. so to summarize: 1 hard drive is being backed up onto 2 different hard drives, one being handled by Veeam and the other by FreeFileSync... all on the same PC
 I'm yet to actually use Veeam for recovery (fingers crossed) but what I've noticed is that the Veeam backup is almost twice the size of the source hard drive. Is that normal? if so, why is that?

Because of the 30TBish of storage I require I will be using my University Alumni Google Drive account (Managed by University IT). For my Synology I'm going to use Hyper Backup for encrypted NAS backups. I do also have a stack of external drives that I'm using for my Plex Server. I'd like to get these files uploaded but encrypted for obvious reasons. What's the most recommended Windows application I can use to encrypt and backup? Keep in mind I don't have the storage space to duplicate the files with encryption, so I'd like to either have on-the-fly encryption or an automated "encrypt a file, upload file, delete the locally encrypted file" type of workflow.

 Is it possible to run this without RAID? I need to use it to add SATA ports to my server and can't use RAID since it is going to be pooled with Drivepool anyway.
 If not, what do you recommend to add 4 SATA ports via PCIe? I don't need anything high performance. Just needs to be reliable.
 Thanks in advance!

 The things I'd be running on it: A Minecraft server for me and my friend, Pi-Hole, and maybe an unturned server, but it'd never run along with the MC server.
 Current setup: An old HP notebook with 4gb of ram and an AMD E2-7110 APU with AMD Radeon R2 graphics running Arch Linux (only reason I didn't go with something like Debian is I just wanted to learn Arch Linux)
 I really don't expect much from it, and I'm not worried about noise or anything from it, as it's gonna be running from a shelf in my basement that already has a loud freezer right next to it. Would this be a reasonable upgrade?

 Whenever I try to use it as an internal drive, the whole system doesn't boot. I've blocked the 3.3v. Multiple times with tape and finally with a box cutter. The drive still spins up when it's connected internally, but I don't get past a bios flash.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow homelab professionals.
 This question should be fairly easy for any of you who have a TP-Link sfp/sfp+ switch.
 I've been looking at getting a TP-Link TL-SX3008F but have been holding off for a while as I'm unsure about their SFP+ module support. Being in Canada I would like to get my modules from fs.com as they are cheaper and I don't have to worry about shipping across the border. 
 I would be using single mode fiber with an LC connector 
 Now here is my problem:
 None of the SFP+ modules list a compatibility with TP-Link devices (see here) so I have been unsure if either:
  
They are unable to make it work with TP-Link.
 They are all compatible and TP-Link switches don't care.
 Or TP-Link's SFP+ interface is actually not their own brand and just uses like a generic Cisco or Intel chip so should work with either.
  
I just have not been able to find anything that says TP-Link other then this one on amazon which is still pretty cheap but I'm worried that being rated for 10km I'll end up burning it out on runs shorter then 10ft

 I'm Vihar from Appsmith, and I'm here to share some major updates on Appsmith's latest releases. 
 In September, we went up a major version in preparation for the curtain raiser on two big features coming real soon—granular access controls and audit logs. We also made native GraphQL available in Appsmith, added a view for console logs, and shipped a whole raft of other improvements. 
 Appsmith is an open-source framework to quickly build any custom business software like admin panels, internal tools, dashboards, and more with pre-built UI widgets that connect to any database, GraphQL or REST API, controlling everything with Javascript.

 I have a RAID 6 array with 7*4TB Seagate IronWolf drives. One of the drives has a slowly increasing number of "Reallocated_Sector_Ct", currently at just over 1000
 As the drive is under warranty still, I asked Seagate if they would accept an RMA, to which they've told me:
 "in the matter of bad blocks, having bad blocks (also known as sectors) on a drive does not make the drive faulty, over the lifetime of a drive, you may find many thousands of sectors may occur, and these will be re-allocated to other sectors on the drive"
 Am I just being overly cautious?

 I feel that the raid is slow for some scenarios I'm currently planning and I'd like to add a nvme cache disk but seems like mdadm doesn't support that feature.
 I've seen bcachefs and lvm-cache as options but both would require formatting the raid. Having to backup and restore more than 100TB of data would require a very long service downtime and I'd prefer not to.
 Any solution that I'm not aware of that would allow me to add a cache disk woithout having to backup/restore all my data?
 In case there's none what would you do? Zfs ? lvm-cache? bcachefs? other?

 I have a few basic questions that I couldn't find in the wiki or FAQ for those who have time. I am just starting to get into data preservation now that I am starting a family and want to make sure nothing is lost. I am trying to plan out where and how to back up my data in a way that makes sense and this sub has been very helpful.
 For my longer term back-ups, I was planning on buying a couple external HDDs and storing one at my home and one at my office. My plan is to refresh the data on these every 6 months from my working data (local nextcloud server). If I do this, do I need to bother checking the quality of the data to make sure no data has been lost/corrupted? Would best practice to be completely re-write the data to the drives as opposed to updating only deltas to assure no data is lost? Sorry if that is a super basic question. 
 Finally, are there any recommendations for external HDDs to look at? Seems to be a ton of options and its hard to pin-point what is best for my use case. I require <10 TB capacity with relatively infrequent read/writes. The top priority being reliability.
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm trying to get up and running my server with debian 11.
 ​
 The first two, and for the moment, only apps I want to get running are Gitea and OpenProjects.
 I got good and running gitea thanks to this helpful tutorial : https://golb.hplar.ch/2018/06/self-hosted-git-server.html
 The gitea instance is good and running.
 Now I'm trying to get running OpenProjects with Caddy but can seem to get the configuration right for the caddy server. Do you have any configuration hanging somewhere in your room ? 
 I found in the documentation the following
  
function as the web server forwarding to our internal server listening at localhost:6000 by proxying.
  
Hence I did in my caddy configuration : 
 openprojects.siteweb.fr{ reverse_proxy localhost:6000 } 
 But when going to the site it does not work, since the "secure connection failed"
 As a wider question, I'm really struggling with all this servers and redirections and subdomains and where the app is... and I cannot find any good tutorials online to understand how to implement and where to search or write what, I'm open for any good books/videos/tutorials :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have an old Dell laptop (windows) that I want to convert into a server that can do 3 things:
  
File server 
 Media server 
 Remote Retro Gaming server
  
Apart from that, if it can run Onlyoffice and extend to other server apps that would be a bonus.
 I've been reading a lot but the information is all over the place and though I think I can get a NAS running I'm not sure how the rest of the 2 would work or which approach is beginner friendly/quick to execute.
 I've had experience with linux and I can casually use it. I'm unsure about what kind of stack to run. I'd want to have windows installed as sometimes I do get stuff that I need done on it (maybe a remote desktop access as well)
 I would love it if anyone can point me in the right direction.

 A requirement would be that it allows role based access so I can limit normal members access to some information while allowing a higher level of information access to other members.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a huge fan of documentaries and last year they dropped a 10 part 'The Center Seat: 55 Years of Star Trek' documentary on a number of services and cable TV. While piracy is common thing better than a 720p rip of this docu series released and in not the best quality. I'm not above buying documentaries I want to keep and re-watch once or twice per year but that usually means buying the DVD or BluRay and ripping that. This... I'm pretty sure won't see a BluRay release. But it is on iTunes at 1080p! But I'm not stupid and I'm not paying for DRM controlled media that only runs through Apple Software.
 So my question is, if I purchased the full 'season' set off iTunes, how could strip out the DRM without re-encoding the video through any lossy process so I could have the docu series to freely rewatch and enjoy for years to come?
 I obviously tried Googling but this is a topic with fairly high SEO for 'handy but scammy retail apps' and I have no idea how to tell the BS from the useful software.

 I bought a 6TB WD HDD exactly a year ago. It's the Western Digital 6TB WD Blue PC Internal Hard Drive HDD - 5400 RPM, SATA 6 Gb/s, 256 MB Cache, 3.5" - WD60EZAZ for anyone wondering.
 Anyways, I was copying files from my Note 9 to my dropbox folder on this drive when all a sudden the drive could not be found. Thats weird. THen I heard beeps coming from the hard drive every few seconds. Tried everything, and plugged the hard drive into my hard drive dock on my other computer. Nothing. Doesn't even recognizes the drive. 
 I used it mostly as my local storage for google drive and dropbox so luckily nothing there was lost. I did lose all of my lightroom photo organization trees and a bunch …]]></summary>

I used rsync with an ssd adapter to pull all the data (a little over 600gb) to my other computer. Is there a GUI utility to checksum every file and tell me what files differ? If not is there a command line utility? I tried teracopy at first but it seems to fail with that many files. I want a GUI utility mostly cause I'm scared shitless of deleting everything and I know some sectors have read problems. I wanna know what files I gotta pull from my back ups and which are fine to keep on my hdd
 Edit: my back up server is at a family members place with a data cap so I'd rather not pull ever file only the ones that are corrupt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Kinda new to home servers, need help configuring things in the best way.
 My setup:
  
An Ubuntu laptop as my server - where all of my containers run.
 Asustor NAS
 Other clients are just my TV/PC.
  
My current setup works great, no issues at all. I just want to make things cleaner and easier for me, and to learn.
 My goal: putting together a DNS server to access stuff locally on my LAN using host names instead of IP/ports.
 Tools I need:
  
DNS server - pihole will be ok?
 reverse proxy - I saw nginx is recommended.
  
I would like everything to be dockerized, as I don't have additional hardware like pi hole, or another server.
 When I run compose-up, I get a default network named after my stack. So the containers are all running in trash network (named after these guides that taught me how to setup plex and *arr apps).
 The only container not in that network is Plex, it's in host mode.
 So my question is about the DNS server. How do I configure Pi Hole to be the main DNS server for my entire home network? Should I run it in host network? will the Ubuntu server become my DNS server technically? Can I configure my ISP router to point to that server's IP?
 Hope I didn't make a mess of my questions.
 Thanks :)

 So far I love it :) Before I used Heimdall and then Homer as my dashboard.
 I would love to run some more services in my homelab but unfortunately where I live I can only get maximum 25Mbps DL and 5Mbps UL FTTC connection.
 I am on 5G now as my main broadband and speeds are better (can get up to 600 Mbps DL and 50 Mbps UL) but sometimes they drop drastically for few days. Still far better then slow FTTC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This sub gets a new "what do you hoard" thread every week, which this is kind of like - but a more interesting take on it. It's not unreasonable that people here don't exactly want to share their hoard, but if you've uploaded to archive.org, it's meant to be preserved - which presumably means that people should see it. Also, y'all probably have some really insightful responses with stories behind them, rather than the usual linux isos / steam games / movies / porn.
 I'll start:
 On March 4 2019, the Facebook page "I made this page to bully shitty doge pages" (now renamed "I made this page to shitpost about alcohol lmao") ran a series called "Doge Noir". Throughout the entire day, they'd continuously post a bunch of images that all told one overarching story, one at a time. 
 I guess the best comparison would be like a webcomic? But webcomics are usually posted on multiple platforms and have their own website or something. By the time the day was over, if you wanted to revisit this obscure story, you'd have to dig up an ancient Facebook meme page. At least until it got an animated adaptation. 
 You can check out my reupload of Doge Noir here. 
 Is this worth archiving? Well, the whole thing is a whopping 7MB, so I'm not exactly straining their data centers with this. I thought it was pretty entertaining. The ending was funny. Doge is my favorite meme, so maybe I'm biased.

 When we first bought our home in 2014, a huge selling point was that the previous owner had wired the whole house with CAT-6e. He left us a simple router and patch panel mounted to the wall in the outside office.
 Humble beginnings
 After we moved in, I installed my modem, a modest Cisco router, a 24-port Netgear switch, and housed my Plex library on two Netgear ReadyNAS devices. I spend a lot of time organizing and perfecting my media library, so I added a Synology DiskStation NAS with equal storage capacity to run nightly delta backups of anything added to the media library—and all of the NAS's have a 1-disk fault tolerance.
 Everything was housed on wire-rack shelving, with a sma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently helping out my dad who owns a very small company that primarily does work as a utility contractor. Our family has been in the industry since the 80's/90's and because of an abundance of paper files and bad practices it is impossible to find anything you are looking for and slows down daily operations in the office. My dad would like to transition to a completely digital system with my help. After some research I have decided on a paperless filing system using a DMS such as Paperless-ngx or Papermerge self hosted with backups to a cloud based solution. We would only need to access the documents on location but being able to outside wouldn't hurt unless that adds complications. Documents would be everything from invoices, bills, tax records, bank statements, time cards, etc. Essentially anything that doesn't need to be kept in its paper form we would like to convert over.
 I need help deciding on the hardware (NUC, NAS, Old Desktop, etc.), any applications I might want to host and use alongside of the DMS, best backup options (can I just use google drive, onedrive, etc?), and anything else you can think of that might be useful to know starting out.
 If at all possible I would like to be able to run two instances of this solution for two different businesses under the same roof. Ideally the hardware would be powerful enough to allow this and maybe some room for growth. Also while on the topic of going digital there were talks of doing some sort of DocuSign for the second business and if that's something that can be self hosted or at the very least be backed up that would be great. Price is a large consideration, but If it is worth the price in quality of life improvement/time savings I will consider it. 
 Thanks a lot!

 I have two main home servers, one hosting a webserver and the other hosting a Nextcloud server. I have a dynamic IP on my router/from my ISP that I'm using in conjunction with duckdns.org instead of a proper Dynamic DNS service (if that makes any difference). 
 Basically I'd like to be able to access both the webserver & the Nextcloud server externally by simply visiting "<myduckdns>.duckdns.org/websrv" & "<myduckdns>.duckdns.org/nextcloud. Is there a way I could set it up to access my webserver with http & https then have /nextcloud connect my Nextcloud Server? 
 I have a couple of solutions I've come up with myself that solve the issue, but not perfectly for me. I could use different ports of course for both of them, but then I wouldn't be able to access them through normal web browsing without adding the ports. 
 And of course I could move the nextcloud srv to the web server or vica versa, but that wouldn't be ideal for me either. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lease a small industrial bay that only has ADSL internet currently. Fibre buildout is happening but has been delayed 6 months.
 The building next to mine has cable, and the ISP can offer up to 2Gbit connection off this. Speaking with them, they're saying if the owners agree, they can run a point to point connection from one building to the other. Either wirelessly or just by running a coax cable between the buildings.
 Running the wire is ideal just from a reliability standpoint I think, but I'm not sure the owners and other tenants would love this... Can't dig up the parking lot, and tough to run a wire across the road in the winter when snow removal is happening. Buildings are only 30-40' from each other, could possibly run it from one roof to another.
 Anyway, I'm wondering if point to point wireless is the way to go, and if this is reliable enough to run servers off of. This setup would be temporary until the fibre build is complete, but it still needs to be reliable, or there's no point.
 Was looking at something like this: https://mikrotik.com/product/wireless_wire
 Thanks for any insight!

 After my last post stating issues I've had with NPM, I decided to try out Cloudflare tunnels. Although this is still something I may do, I want to try one more option.
 I was running Nginx Proxy Manager on Windows 11 Pro, and obviously this was not working properly.
 As such, I want to install it on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, running on one of my Raspberry Pi's. This Pi will be dedicated to ONLY running Docker with NPM installed, and nothing else.
 The issue: I set up Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and installed Docker (Which I verified was working), and installed NPM (which stated as running). I then ran "Sudo sfw 80/tcp" & "Sudo sfw 443/tcp", as well as for UDP, and attempted to log into the control panel for NPM on my main desktop. The page did not load. I then opened port 81 as well, and it still did not load.
 I'm at the point I'm asking for help again, as Googling for hours and trying various options has not worked.
 Please help. Thank you all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on some projects that involve running games and other software on very old operating systems, mainly Windows 3.11-XP. I'd like to be able to host these OSes as VMs on my servers and stream the video, audio, and input to remote clients. Usually people achieve this sort of streaming using Parsec, Steam, or Geforce within the VM. But none of those run on these old OSes, and they shouldn't have network access anyway. Another solution would be to run the old OS inside DOSbox or VMWare Workstation on Windows 10, both of which are designed for high performance local VM interaction, then stream that over Parsec. But this only works well on bare metal. Trying to run this on top of a hypervisor Proxmox [Bare metal] -> Windows 10 [Qemu/KVM] -> Windows 95 [VMWare Workstation] results in nested virtualization, which absolutely trashes the performance of the inner VM on my server hardware. What would be ideal is if the hypervisor could directly handle the streaming of the VMs to remote clients using H.264 instead of VNC or SPICE.
 Does anyone know of a homelab hypervisor solution that is capable of realtime streaming the contents of multiple VMs, without resorting to nested virtualization? I recall finding that VSphere or Citrix had something like this, but cost like $10,000 yearly or some garbage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have
  
TP-link TL-SG1024DE 24-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch
 TP-link TL-SG3428 24 Port Gigabit Switch, 4 SFP Slots
 TP-link TL-SG108 8-Port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Desktop Switch
 BLADE RackSwitch G8124 24-Port 10Gb rack switch. (No links needed since it basically does as what the description says it does.)
  
I started with the TP with 4 SFP, not understanding that 10Gb was SFTP+. I added the other switch for failover/redundancy, got the desktop switch for either work isolation or home isolation (still have a plan of setting up personal NAS with NextCloud for mobile backup and entertainment deployment for both cellphone and laptops), and planned on using the 10Gb switch to connect my powervaults storage to my other servers. (A mixture of poweredges, sunfires, and a Power7 server of all things equipment.)
 However, I came across these items for a great deal:
  
4 Fortinet FortiSwitch 448D-POE, switch
 Fortinet FortiSwitch 1024D, firewall/vpn + switch
 Fortinet FortiGate 200D, firewall/vpn management node
  
and now I'm wondering what I should do with them. Replace my current switches for these, or sell them for at least twice (probably closer to 3 times) what I paid for them? I still need to buy SPF+ cards for my equipment to take advantage of 10gb BLADE I do have, let alone all the Fortinet stuff (apparently, all 10gb SPF+)
 I'm also afraid I'm not knowledgeable enough to manage these Fortinet equipment. (Currently failing at setting up pfSense through Proxmox on my Dell r320. I stupidly cannot get the internet passed through a virtual linux bridge to my containers and vm. :( )

 I have an Eaton 5P 1500 Battery backup, 3 batteries inside all were replaced, and the unit says its protected, but the display complains that it needs service. 
 About 2 years ago, I know a client that had one of these and I replaced the batteries and did some type of reset with the front panel. Powering it on while holding buttons OR something. I cannot for the life of me find this combination, and my google-fu has failed me dearly.
 Its up and running right now, and I downloaded the Eaton SetUPS program to update the firmware, but of course its telling me it has to be off in order to update the firmware, so I am trying to find some time to do that…
 But Im hoping someone here can maybe help me with knowing the combination I can just use to reset this and move on with life. 
 Anyone?

 Litfibre.com is their site. Looks like a limited roll out in the midlands so far, not sure if they’re piggybacking on BT’s fibre infrastructure. I’d assume so but I thought that network would be supporting symmetric speeds for some time yet. Would be interested if anyone knows more!

 Not sure how to accomplish this or if it's even a good way. I'd like to have the 2x 4TB in the Windows PC to store games and media and such, but in RAID 1 for better read performance and some redundancy. Don't necessarily need the backup to the NAS, but if there is an easy way to do it I would. The NAS is an old PC with a 1Gbps ethernet to PC and entire network.
 I don't know a good way to make a RAID 1 array to do this, as I've heard both good and bad for making the array in windows, in the motherboard uefi/bios or with a hardware card.
 Is there a better use of the drives?
 Would a single 4TB SSD be more reliable and a safer spot for data vs 2x HDD's?
 Please leave suggestions below.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had some downtime thanks to a crappy economy and started sorting through boxes sitting at the shop from customer projects. I found an OpenWRT board that wasn't used and wondered if it would work for TrueNAS. I then wondered if I could piece together a NAS just from the unused and/or broken things in the shop (almost). I did have to buy some DDR4 for the openwrt board and the case, but the rest are odds & ends from other projects. 
 Frankenstein has a 150W 12v psu, a 100W pico ATX psu (just for the control board) and two 12v to 5v DC-DC converters for the SSDs and HDDs. If it's plugged in and the main switch is on, the SSDs have +5v power regardless of the motherboard state so firmware is free to do whatever it does offline. The second switch is for powering the two HDDs and a small fan for the HDDs. Sans HDs, it's whisper quiet.
 The control board is an N6005 at 3.2Ghz, 32GB RAM, 11 SATA ports, one nvme and 4 2.5gbe ports.
 Power is ~21W idle for control board + SSDs, ~32W idle for everything. I only had five free SSDs sitting around, so it's missing a few in the photo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think part of the reason we get involved in this hobby is to not have our data hanging out on other people's servers/available to the public. So, I'm wondering if this is possible.
 Is there a way to set "public" sub domains of my TLD to private? 
 For instance, if I set up a randomsubdomain.example.com is there a way to have that only accessbile behind a password protected TLD?
 I'm picturing, if someone were to try and access randomsubomain.example.com directly they would be send to example.com which has a Welcome message and log in screen. From there, links would be accessible to send the end user to subdomainX.example.com
 I am hoping to use my websites for job applications, and only have them accessible to recruiters/hiring managers as I dont want all my work history publically exposed etc. They're currently accessible directly, but each page is password protected. 
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 I assume this is a 3v pin issue. but I tried tape (would not boot), Molex adapters (would not boot), and cutting the orange wire (would not boot).
 ​
 what else can be causing the A2 boot error?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to scrape data from Instagram on Python. Obviously that requires me to login to an Instagram account. But they seem to be detecting them very fast. For example, I will create a brand new Instagram account on an IP I've never used before (in this case, it was at a library). I will then plug in those credentials to my script and run it.
 Once that happens, it usually comes back right away with a `challenge_required` message.
 So I go to the account, login, do the "challenge" (usually a code that is sent to the email affiliated with the account. The email being used is tied to an email address that has never been used on Instagram) and once I enter the code, it usually suspends me right away.
 How does it know? I'm doing all of this on a fresh IP that I've never used before, on an Instagram that I've never used before, which is tied to an email that I've never used.
 Is there a way around this? Is there a "cleaner" way I could do this without them sniffing out the account so quickly?
 What's funny is that when I run the script using my normal, person Instagram that I've had for years, it normally doesn't suspend it. It might ask me to enter a 2FA code, but that's it. I'll then re-run it and it works. I just don't want to keep using that because I don't want to get my real account suspended.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to post something about Frigate NVR, a self-hosted AI-driven NVR with Home Assistant support. I recently migrated from Ring to Frigate after finally biting the bullet for eight fancy POE cameras. 
 I went from around 10 false positive notifications a day with eight Ring cameras to around maybe 2 to 3, and my cameras constantly record (what a novel idea, cameras that record constantly! Ring is a step backwards in this regard.), and I record specific events like cars, dogs, bicycles, etc. People detected go straight to my phone through Home Assistant, which is proxied through cloudflared for remote access.
 Seriously, get rid of Ring if you can. It's a privacy nightmare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking into Crowdsec, but there is one thing that i can't really find anywhere. and that is more detailed info about the acquis.yml file and how to write those.
 I am using docker and from what i can find, crowdsec can read the logs from containers. The only thing i cant find, is how to write that down.
 the Docs state that you can set the source to docker. That was easy.
 but what about labels > type? i can't find anything what i am supposed to set as type for my containers. i see some examples with syslog but the example from the Docs say:
 source: <source> labels: type: log_type #log_level: <log_level> 
 Is there any list or overview of types somewhere, cause i can't find it. I saw a traefik example that defined type: traefik. but that is pretty much all i could find. which is somewhat limiting to understand what the type could be.
 does that mean i can simply set any type i want? Does anyone know more about this?

She has asked me to find some older tv shows, but because they were older they tend to not be streamable/torrnetable. I am having very hard time finding copies. Even somewhat semi-newer shows that she may enjoy like MythBusters seem to have evaporated into the digital ether. Any suggestions on where I should poke around to find them besides used/thrift stores or someplace like half price books?

 I have an Ubuntu machine in my home with the local IP 10.0.0.xxx and the public IP [I'm not telling you]. I have a domain registered at example.com and pointing to the public IP, and it's currently able to see my /var/www/html/ contents. Great! I have a little homepage set up and everything. (I can't access the website from inside my local network, but I'm aware that's a hairpin issue and am replacing my shitty xfinity router soon.) 
 How can I access my Docker containers through example.com? For example, while 10.0.0.xxx:5005 takes me to my dashboard, example.com:5005 doesn't. 
 So, uh, help? Please?

 "Dear student,
 WGU has used many Google Workspace for Education products (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, Docs, Forms, etc.). The use of these products has been free and unlimited until now. Google recently announced that they are introducing a fee structure for Google Workspace storage which means institutions like WGU will incur charges for using/storing these products beyond a set quota. 
 Due to Google’s policy changes, and to use student tuition responsibly, WGU is instituting a 5 GB storage limit on total storage in Google. Total storage is a combined total of Gmail, Photos, and Google Drive. This same 5 GB storage limit will be placed on Microsoft Office 365 OneDrive accounts. We will begin applying these changes on Tuesday, November 8. 
 📷If you are over 5 GB, you will receive separate communication. If you do not receive a separate communication, no further steps are required. 
 If you would like to check your Google storage usage, you may check it at: drive.google.com. 
 To check your storage, log in to OneDrive, click the Settings icon in the upper-right 📷 > OneDrive Settings > More Settings > Storage Metrics. 
 For questions or further details on this change, please visit the following Student Handbook FAQ: File Storage. 
 Sincerely, 
 Ed Tech Communications
 Western Governors University"

 I use a couple external harddrives to store some videos/movies. I usully like once a week plug that drive into my computer and watch a video directly from it. Is this really bad for the long term health of the drive compared to just copying those video files onto my computer and then watching them? I'm also planning to purchase another larger extrnal harddrive since my current drives are getting older and I need to back them up. I saw some WD drives recommended here. Do those often go on sale since the holiday season is coming up? I wanted to decide if I should buy now or wait a couple months. Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So before we get started here, I just want to point out that I'm only using these SMR drives in environments where self-powered, small footprint drives, for less than the cost of 4TB SSDs are required. Once they've been written to, they're only ever read from thereafter.
 Write performance is obviously the problem I'm running into. It's particularly frustrating building multiple drives. What usually happens is that everything starts out fine, around 90 MB/s but eventually performance falls through the floor once they begin filling up. Writing files at this point gets REALLY slow.. 100 KB/s - 10 MB/s.
 I've seen others mention doing a DD Write of an entire drive to get around the SMRs internal micromanaging. Is it possible to create a 5TB image that I can mount and modify from a larger drive, then DD Write that image to the SMR drive when it's ready? I need to use ext2 partition for my application if that makes a difference.

 I'm not going to trust this drive for anything I care about, but is it useful for things I don't care about?
 For example...
 I could use it for security camera footage in a mirrored ZFS pool to speed up reads. Every now and then it'd fail a read, but I don't care.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I currently have a Dl380 Gen 7 and it's quite power hungry. It has the top xeon for that server (twice) and 128gb memory. Also 6 10k rpm drives.
 I could buy the same server (or even a Dl380) gen 9.
 Under the same load, will I save power? I tried searching for it, but it's quite hard to make that decision.
 Anybody got any insights?

So let's say one dies, it's even hard to remember which services was running there and how that was configured! While I keep configs stored in repositories, I miss something which easily tell me on that server you have these services running configured in that way.
 So that's my question, how are you organised? A google document? Something better?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 Long time lurker here, and thanks to you all, gotten some ideas on my vault build for personal archiving.
 I am here, though, to directly ask for advice before committing to buying the parts for the build.
 I do Youtube, Twitch, and do tutoring as my job, So I want to keep a record of these things, plus all the documentation of pay, income, expenses, scripts, etc. As well as restoration images of my systems and copies of my live boot images for my utility devices.
  
Which Live Boot OS/Firmware should I go with that I can run as a Read Only Live boot for security that would offer the most compatibility and give me SAN and NAS hybrid features for network data access and management?
 I am torn between using Data Disk Archive or a Tape Drive for offloading data for "Deep Storage" to free up space if needed; which should I go with, or should I use both?
 I am looking to go with ZFS for the system, but as a paranoid type, I want to encrypt my data in a way that will play nice with ZFS, is system agnostic, and will not play havoc with the "Deep Storage" I go with. So, which encryption method and/or software should I use the keep the data in the Z-Pools and storage medium secure from unauthorized access, that is brute force resistant?
  
Sorry if I'm asking a lot or if my questions may be dumb of me to ask, but I know that I know very little and mostly select info, so I want to differ to more knowledgable individuals than I so that I can get this right the first time. Again, though, thank you for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several self hosted apps and services that notify me about various things such as alerting me of errors, services going down, items of stock become available and just general notifications.
 Currently I'm just using SMTP to send emails to my personal address so I get notifications on my phone, which is fine... but my notifications are growing and I want it a bit more organization and cleaner.
 My thought was to create a private Slack and create channels to group the various notifications. Slack is wildly adapted as a notification channel so software support shouldn't be a problem however I have some concerns about privacy and I'd rather use something I have more control over.
 I know Mattermost is an alternative to Slack but not sure how supported it is in terms of sending automated messages, notifications, other software supporting it.
 Does anyone have any suggestions, or have solutions to similar issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I work for a locally owned ISP and we used to utilize TiVo. Our contract with TiVo ran out and we are phasing them out, they are past end of life so we were going to recycle all the boxes. One of the guys in the warehouse shucked all the drives, some good, some bad, some close to bad. I've got around 80 drives and want to know the best way to use them. 
 I already have an unraid server set up with a 4TB parity drive, but it's pretty much maxed out. I was thinking about buying 2 PCI SATA Cards with 10 SATA conneections each, and then using the onboard sata connectors on a motherboard (which I don't have yet) to run the parity drive along with the cache disks, which I will likely get new 1tb SSD's for. 
 I'm not sure how to mount 20 disks though, I was thinking of having my friend (who does 3D design for a living) design me a tower that could hold them all in place and 3D printing that, but it seems like there should be some sort of off the shelf solution. I don't have a rack and was hoping to use / reuse some old PC cases I have already. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife had a corrupted SD card, and I feel partly responsible for the loss because I had not previously set up a household data management system. Her 256 GB laptop has been sitting at 99% full for months. I decided it was time to make a change. 
 I recently built a new office PC for myself, which left an empty tower (HAF 912, 8GB ram, z77 extreme4 mobo with 8 sata ports) sitting around. I ordered five WD red+ 4TB drives for $70/each, and a new 200 mm Noctua case fan for the front of my HAF 912 to blow over the drives. 
 I wasn't sure whether I would be able to pull it off, but installing TrueNAS, setting up the pool, users, groups, permissions, etc. was all straightforward with the help of youtube. Useful volume is 10.9 TB, set up in Raid Z2. Performance is reasonable - around 90 MB/s over my wireless LAN bridge. For an "all-in" price of ~$400, I'm quite happy with the system. 
 I set up gmail alerts, weekly SMART tests, bi-monthly scrubs, and I have everything set to back up to BackBlaze B2 weekly. 
 Everything seems to be going.... too well. Is this really all that I need to do? I was considering doing some failure testing, i.e. unplugging a drive, and seeing how TrueNAS notifies me. Or unplugging two drives, and trying to manually run a BackBlaze backup to see if it will fail. 
 Big shout-out to the content creators and community for the helpful guides on pulling this off.

 What you need: A computer or Rapsberry pi, maybe an android can work too.
 TLDR:
 ssh -L 192.168.0.100:8888:192.168.1.50:8096 user@tailscale -p 22 -N
 You can create a ssh tunnel to open the Tailscale connection to LAN network
 Probably this is probably relatively unsafe because you are exposing your tailscale connection on lan, so beware other people connected to your network.
  
I've been looking for a basic way to this for a while and found a relatively simple solution. I'm new to networking so I don't have much knowledge. My problem is that I wanted to access a device that was in a far geographic position (A). For example, 192.168.0.60:5054, however, in location (B) with my Smart Tv, is not possible to install Tailscale. However, I have access to a …]]></summary>

 As a long time data hoarder, I saved it, and every other piece of spam I got until 2006 when the flood became too much and I lost interest.
 So now I'm thinking there might be some spam historian out there who would be interested. I would just publish it but there is the possibility that some personal email made its way into the hoard. Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tried finding the best sub for this and i figured you guys are probably one of the betters to ask. 
 Im running a gaming station, web server, torrent manager, media server etcetc all on the same computer. Everythings run in parallell, mostly to and from one large HDD and i actually sit down and use this computer for personal use as well, mostly not accessing the same HDD other than for some file transfers.
 Running W10.
 I use a program called Netlimiter to monitor and limit/throttle my network usage on a per application level, so i put a ceiling on for example my torrent client to have a maximum upload speed of 500KB/s as to not use up all available bandwidth and ruin it for everything else. (i know many programs gives control of this individually, but not all)
 Im looking for an equivalent but regarding disk I/O. Most of my media is on one large HDD. If this gets indexed, downloaded to, streamed from, unpacked to and library scanned at the same time, it quickly bogs down with 100% disk usage and makes streaming movies locally a buffering, laggy and impossible mess. Kind of defeats the purpose of local streaming.
 Many of the things causing the 100% usage can come at any time or at random, making a movie start buffering and getting stuck halfway through even if everything was fine and the disk wasnt used when the movie started.
 I dont need every process to have access to 100% of the HDDs read-speed at all times whenever the process feels like it. 5% would be enough for a reoccuring library scan and not interrupt my 90%-quota for my mediaserver for example. Netlimiter solves this fantastically in every aspect in terms of my network but i cant seem to find a good solution regarding the disks.
 Any ideas or tips on how to do this?
 TLDR: How to set hard limit on .exe to use max 1MB/s write speed to disk regardless of disks maximum write speed?

In fact, I do have a Wireguard instance setup on my home network that I remote into regularly in order to access servers/perform maintenance. 
 The other obvious way to do this is to just port forward the HTTP/S ports for the application that I want to expose on the internet, but I don't know how comfortable I feel about this since there could be a vulnerability on whateve…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to repurpose my old 2009 Mac Pro 4,1 as a VMware ESXi 7.0 hypervisor. I want to add some NVMe storage which I can do with a cheap PCIe converter card + a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB NVMe . The thing is, my Radeon RX 560 2GB card is so large that it is blocking the only other free 16-lane PCIe slot (there are 2 in the machine)....but I have 2 other 4-lane PCIe slots open free and clear.
 So my options are, in order of current preference:
  
Use one of the aforementioned free 4-lane PCIe slots
 Buy a PCIe extender ribbon cable to reach out past the graphics card and have the adapter just sitting lose in the case.
 Re-install the original Nvidia Quadro graphics card (non-metal GPU and much weaker)
  
I don't need GPU passthrough to any VMs so while 3 isn't ideal at all, it is workable. Not sure if a powerful GPU is even really necessary for a type-1 hypervisor at all...?
 My biggest question is:
  
Will I lose throughput / bandwidth by using the 4-lane PCIe slot instead of the 16-lane one?
  
Many thanks in advance.

 I've been dealing with that drive above for hours now trying to figure out if it or my OS is faulty. It only has 950 power on hours and based on some of the smartctl data (see here) it could be screwed. I'm not sure (more used to reading the data on CrystalDiskInfo). It also doesn't help that I got this from an auction and now I'm suspecting they reset the SMART hours somehow. 
 Is this normal for these kinds of drives to have really low hours till failure? Or is this drive just faulty? I also can't confirm if it has been dropped recently (I have some suspicions but nobody around me has come clean yet).

I know the server I have (IBM x3650 m4 w/ redundant 900W PSUs) can handle the power requirement of the P5000, but I am unsure of the P6000. As far as I can tell, the board has 2 x 8 pin GPU power plugs, but I'm not sure if the system would have an issue with it. 
 The reason for the upgrade is because my P1000 is pretty maxed out on its available transcode streams.
 If anyone has tried this, or has another idea that I'm not thinking of, any suggestions would be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I saw a really cheap PDU with a cut power cable for sale. Doesn't seem very difficult to replace the wire, but the PDU wasn't tested (seller couldn't with cut cable).
 I was wondering if cutting the wire is some kind of industry convention indicating the PDU is broken or something?
 Is replacing the cable actually difficult and I am just being naive? Has anybody done it? Anything to be careful of?
 I hope this is the right place to ask and thank you.

 I have a vps which I use to store files on google drive via an encrypted rclone mount.
 I can view the files fine on the VPS but I can only see the encrypted version on Goodsync and it will not accept the password from my rclone.conf file. For some reason in the rclone.conf file it shows password and password 2 (I have tried both)
 1, is there a way to do this?
 2, why are there 2 passwords in the rclone.conf file?
 TIA!

 https://myapps.taec.toshiba.com/myapps/admin/jsp/webrma/addRequest1NoLogin.jsp
 http://www1.hgst.com/warranty/index_gtech_serial.do (doesn't seem to work)
 Anyone know where to check HGST? Do they even still brand them as HGST? If not them I guess that one is no longer needed. I've also seen some software for such things (ex Lansweeper) but I'm looking for something simpler. I've only seem software meant for businesses or it is more of an asset management system, which is way overkill for what I need. I'm open to suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit non-standard this, help and advice appreciated.
 I was a very happy ownCloud user until I moved my data to a home server, at which point the client wouldn't work any more; it doesn't like network shares and won't allow them to be configured. There are workarounds, like installing an old version of the client and then upgrading, but I don't like workarounds, it's only a matter of time before they stop working completely.
 So I switched to Seafile, which seemed to work, but that actually stops syncing after a while too, I assume the problem comes down to file notifications across Samba or summat.
 I'm currently looking at switching to a hybrid approach, using Syncthing to sync my files up to my VPS, with FileRun on top to handle sharing and browsing. I'd do that on both sites, so I have an interface on both sites if I need it / in case of emergency. However I'd prefer to have the server as the master if possible. So before I make the big switch, are there any other options?

 All of these in a Chrome or Firefox extension that adds these features directly onto the Gmail interface
  
I know Gmail has some of these features built in but they're either hidden away via extra clicks (instead of just showing those features outright) or they suck.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks 👋 I've just created plausible-exporter.
 It's a simple tool to export your website's "vital" metrics from Plausible Analytics to Prometheus, so you can get a quick overview on how your website is doing in Grafana.
 I've been running it for about two weeks now and it seems to work great! Here's a screenshot of one of my Grafana dashboards (for riesinger.dev):

 I'm very open to suggestions and feedback, as well as contributions!
 ​
 The code is quite unorganized still, I'll hopefully find some time to clean it up, but you know the drill: Make it work; make it right; make it fast 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what you're thinking.
 "You probably deleted it by mistake."
 "You probably never saved it to your cloud, but you thought you did."
 "Maybe you downloaded a flagged file and Google deleted it without notifying you."
 I can assure you, I double check everything before emptying my trash to make sure nothing important is getting accidentally deleted.
 I can also assure you that I'm 100% sure I've uploaded these files because they were mounted using rclone recently.
 So the only possible explanation is that Google is deleting files without notifying their users, which is stated nowhere in their terms of use.
 This Mashable article states that Google will delete your files for account inactivity, but that shouldn't apply to me because I use my gdrive almost every day.
 So what's the possible explanation for this?
 Edit
 For anyone thinking it's a sync issues, I don't sync my files with the official Drive app. I upload them and that's it. If I want to access them on my PC, I just mount gdrive with rclone, then unmount when I'm finished. I don't continually sync my files.
 There has to be another explanation for these files disappearing.

 I am OK with fronting a VPS instead, but my understanding is that many (most?) VPS providers ip blocks have the same issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks. Been trying to set up my raspberry pi cluster for a few weeks. Learned a lot, but still not there. After failing at a few tutorials that turned out to be too outdated, I’ve got the hang of setting up basics of a K3s cluster.
 I tend to run into issues with cert managers, DNS etc. I’m currently running K3s + MetalLB + Traefik + Cert Manager. I’m currently trying to install Rancher (in order to have dashboard plus easy install of Longhorn for storage), but came to a stall when I have to “Set the hostname to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer” here. I’ve read good things about Tailscale as an alternative.
 In the end I want a cluster with home media capabilities (maybe Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr etc) available at my local IP or even better my_cool_ip.dev. Next step would be adding more apps like Bitwarden at my_cool_ip.dev/vault. I have a 3 node RPi cluster that I think I can do some cool stuff with if I can figure out ingress, certs, load balancing and IPs. Any tips would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am rapidly outrunning my current storage solution, and will have to build something new very soon. I am looking to build a system to serve primarily as a NAS, but also to handle some other services, so that I don't have to keep my desktop running day and night.
 My general requirements for the system are:
 + It should be able to run the operating system of my choice
 - This eliminates most pre-built NAS solutions (Synology, Drobo, etc.)
 + It should support at least 5 drives (I want to run 5x 8TB drives in either RAIDZ1 or RAIDZ2) + It should be expandable in future
 + It should consume as little power as possible
 The solution that I have come up with is to use a mini PC connected to a hard drive enclosure. The mini PC would run the NAS software and run ZFS on the connected drives. + The mini PC: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PBK35VD + The drive enclosure: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y4F5SCK + The drives: 5x https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQX27GM
 Does this solution make sense, or have I made a mistake somewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright so I'm sure this topic has been discussed countless times, yet from my searching a few things still aren't clear to me, and I'm sure this same confusion exists for others as well.
 First, let me briefly establish what I do know. According to the internet, greedy companies have got copyright laws in the weird position where backing up your physical discs is legal in concept but not in practice, because you're not allowed to break the encryption on the blu-ray discs.
 Most people ripping blu-rays out there seem to be trying to break this encryption so they can make the blu-rays "DRM free" and save it as a regular file. I hate DRM as much as the next guy, but my primary purpose is to digitize my blu-rays for convenience of use and safety from natural disasters.
 So my thought is simple: Why not just avoid breaking the encryption? Is there some technical reason why you can simply copy the data on a blu-ray as-is into an ISO or something and just load that up digitally on the drive (like inserting the disc) whenever you want to watch it? Or is that not how it works? I don't understand how an encryption technique could prevent you from simply copying the data as-is into an ISO and then just treat it like a "regular" blu-ray disc?
 And if you can do this, then doesn't it partially negate the whole purpose of the encryption anyways? I mean, it isn't like someone couldn't just copy an ISO file just like any other regular video file.
 Can someone clear up why "breaking the encryption" seems to be so unavoidable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so I got into self hosting recently by setting up a raspberry pi with an external harddrive as NAS with Open Media Vault and the hobby kinda catched me so I would like to expand a little bit by getting some small server hardware that has more capabilities than a pi. What would be your reccomendations for taking the 'next step'? Is there common server hardware that is sold used on ebay often for a good price? I would like something like a low power consumption server having at least 16GB of ram and a fairly strong cpu, powerful enough to run some docker containers at the same time, ideally maybe even a game server as container. It would be perfect if it could be upgraded easily by adding some more ram and maybe even switching out the cpu to a more powerful model at some point. Regarding the price I'm ready to spend up to 300-400$ excluding harddrives, if that would be sufficient? Thanks for your recommendations.

 1 - Hardware raid 10 over iSCSI
 2 - ZFS (With SSD in L2Arc) over NFS
 I can see the benefits and downsides of both but what would be best in terms of performance? Both will be being served over 10GB DAC with multipathing
 Any suggestions/improvements are very welcome

 ​
 I have a 12TB WD elements drive thats almost full with data on. Would shucking the drive be a bad idea? I dont want to risk losing the data as this drive is my final backup (multiple drives backed up to this 12tb one).
 ​
 Thanks for any advice!

 Does Paperless-NGX not do OCR on such?
 After importing it with Paperless-NGX, and then going to "Documents", when I open the particular document and check "Content" tab, it shows nothing. (even though the text should be readable by OCR)
 Thanks,

 Paperless-Ngx uses a volume for the DB, but I want it to use the postgres database I already made for it. I have postgres running as a container already and have a few other containers using it for their databases.
 When I tried to change the settings using portainer it still uses the volume and not the pre-existing database.

 Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to expose Nextcloud to the internet. For sensitive services I always like to have two layers of authentication/protection. 
 When I configured a Tautulli instance there was an option in the official app configuration to pass HTTP authentication credentials to my nginx proxy manager instance. 
 I think this is great because now Tautulli is behind nginx HTTP authentication and a Tautulli authentication portal after that. But the great thing is that the HTTP authentication was configured once on setup and users don't have to deal with it again.
 I would like something similar for Nextcloud. Currently, the apps don't expect an HTTP authentication portal before the Nextcloud instance so the client apps break. Ideally, it should be a one time setup so that the user really only authenticates with Nextcloud going forward after the initial configuration.
 I do not want to use a VPN because it is not as user friendly, it gives people access to my devices and you can only reliably run a single VPN at a time so I would not be able to use a VPN provider at the same time.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I currently have a Synology NAS and have enjoyed running a few apps such as Pi-Hole and BitWarden server using docker. I have been super impressed with how efficient these apps run. However, I am starting to bog down my Synology and would like to start using my Intel Mac mini for some contained apps. Its a high spec machine for being a Mac mini (i7, 16gb ram). I understand I could purchase another machine that runs solely linux, but for my current situation, I've got to use what I have currently.
 My issue is that I need something that is efficient but also not extraordinarily complicated. I am currently running a headless Windows 10 VM via parallels to run a Sonarr/QBit setup that has a PIA killswitch. But this is pretty inefficient and uses a bit more resource from the machine than it should for what I'm trying to accomplish. I have tried an Ubuntu VM, and the resource use is similar. I am also using the machine for Plex transcodes and it is a home machine for my family and I to use for basic schoolwork and web browsing tasks. I have read some on the Apple Hypervisor for VM's. But most of my research comes up with M1 forums which aren't helpful for my Intel machine. I am not opposed to using docker on the Mac, but most of what I've read says that it's super inefficient and not worth using. Maybe it's changed in recent, I'm not sure.
 Hoping someone that has some better knowledge about how container/VM apps work might be able to suggest something that would better fit my needs than what I have currently. Thanks!

 https://hub.docker.com/r/domistyle/idrac6/

 all I had to do was edit the command that is on that page with the IP of the Idrac and the username and password and i was able to get to the visual console of the Idrac

 I would like to merge all the accounts and have a single pop3 server hosted on my linux box which I will access only from my local network. I'm not interested in hosting and taking care of full fledged mail server, I would like to still rely on my email providers.
 Is there any out-of-the-box solution for this?

 Given what they did to GamesPedia, might be worth archiving current versions of these sites as we don’t know what will be lost in this acquisition. I’m probably going to look into that this week as there’s a ton of stuff on here :/

 I've been wanting to learn rust for a while, and I had this project Idea I wanted to try. So here it is:
 https://github.com/dorianim/money-balancer
 It is a super simple web app and PWA which makes it easy to manage debts in a group of people, for example on a group trip. You just enter who paid how much, and it calculates who owes what to whom.
 It's kind of basic right now, but maybe it's helpful to someone :)

 Since it was brought up a few times in the comments: This project is similar to the commercial app "Splitwise", but not as feature-complete (yet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I shared this post in a few developer communities like Hacker News and it was well received. Over the past few years I've been working on an open source project called Micro, an API first development platform and I'm now sharing Micro Services, a catalog of reusable real world Micro services.
 Most of what's here was built with the goal of offering a cloud service to developers but it is something that is entirely self hostable and actually an avenue I'd like to personally explore more. I've always taken a local first approach to development and Micro + Micro Services can be run locally. 
 A few years ago I was experimenting with running Micro on a Raspberry Pi and even offering some sort of official image. Longer term I'd like to build in a UI for querying services and a secure network. 
 Predominantly the goal of the project is to create a set of services that can be an open alternative to what exists already. Currently we offload a lot to the cloud and provide a single unified querying layer but if more could be built into each service they could truly be a self hosted alternative. 
 Would love to get some feedback on how this could become a defacto self hosted solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just set up my first home server running Debian Bullseye.
 I'd like the server to hold my movies and music, but I care much more about music functionality than bells and whistles on movies and videos.
 Most important to me would be that whatever setup I go with, it acknowledges my star ratings and date that I last played it. I also want to be able to give new star ratings when I get more music.
 The last time I had a good self-hosted music setup was when my ipod classic still worked. I occasionally synced my ipod with itunes on a Windows machine via USB.
 I tried out Jellyfin, but their android app for playing music is too buggy, and there's no way to assign star ratings or make smart playlists.
 I'm thinking of giving Kodi a shot, and hope that maybe there's a plug-in or something that will let me give star ratings and keep track of play counts and date last played, the way itunes used to.
 Background:
 The server is running Debian, and the Kodi docs warn of extra complications with Kodi and Debian. I'm not sure if I should worry about that or if it won't matter because the clients aren't on Debian.
 The clients will either be Android-based devices, or some flavor of Ubuntu.
 Questions:
  
Should I go with a different back end for the server, or use the one built into Kodi?
 Should I forget about Kodi and look at some other client/server combination?
  
I will be adding movies, photos, and home videos to the server, but satisfying my music library needs is most important.
 There are so many options and combinations that I'm just hoping to get some general direction.
 Thanks!

 So I have a "router" that happens to be running pfSense with an i7 12700k CPU. I'm kind of curious, if I were to get DDOSed, would it still have the same impact as on a regular router, or would it be harder take it out of service because of the more powerful CPU?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope this is ok to post, but I could use some help. 
 My home is 3 stories, and I want to set up a solid wireless network that is as hidden as possible (read: high WAF). I’ve got an Amplifi HD, but I’m not thrilled with the coverage and speed. 
 I see locations where I can run Ethernet to all three floors, and would ideally like to use PoE AP’s so that I can hide AP’s in closets without running power, but am open to non PoE options. 
 I imagine that ceiling mount throws coverage mostly down for one room, so would that not work with one AP per floor?
 I’m also seeing that some consumer mesh networks automatically adjust coverage to prevent crosstalk and am not sure if more enterprise / prosumer solutions rely on the installer to map coverage to prevent crosstalk?
 Finally, while I do have a technical background, I prefer not to tinker with tech at home (fully realize I may be asking in the wrong subreddit here, but am hoping you all may know of solutions).
 Any help and advice greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 Before I start - I just want to say I didn't setup my homelab in the hopes of ever making money of it. I just recently thought it would be cool to repurpose some of my idle hardware to host some services for people, as a hobby / sidegig.
 ​
 Anyways, as the title suggests, do any of you generate revenue from your homelab? and if so, how? I wouldn't consider my current setup highend, and the majority of it consists of 12th gen dell and 8th gen HP servers. (Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&T's stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I'm (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. 
 I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren't officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, or if there's better solutions for a side gig.

 anyway, i like putting stuff in archives. dealing with tons of files its been helpful to keep stuff tidy and organized. i see that i can do recovery volumes in winrar when building my archives which from what i can gather work like par files. i wondered from anybody who has experience with this stuff if it is better to stick to a program like multipar or if this winrar feature is legit and these .rev files could help rebuild an archive in the event of corruption?
 thanks for any help on the subject

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am slowly getting into self hosting. I have made a TrueNAS SCALE machine that, so far, just serves as a media server. I use, and have used, Plex heavily for years, movies and shows only.
 I am getting into organizing and serving other media I use less frequently:
  
Photos, Images
 Audiobooks
 Podcasts
 Comic books
  
I'm ready to tackle the next content on my list: photos & images. I frequently see two self-hosted solutions recommended here: Photoprism and Plex photos to a lesser extent. 
 I recall a couple years ago Plex ended the phone auto-upload capability, which fed into its Photo libraries. However, I see nextcloud+plex recommended as a means to sync photos from phones to plex. I like plex's built-in abilities to serve content outside of my local network. On the other hand, should I be concerned that plex will pull the plug on the photos feature completely?
 Photoprism seems to have some extra capabilities such as feature/face recognition. The UI is unfamiliar at the moment though.
 I definitely want to use something with a native docker build in the truenas scale "app" libraries to keep things simple. I think I would like to, at a minimum, separate my libraries into photos and images (for things like digital art).
 Which approach would be best for a self hosting beginner with the above needs? Anything obvious I'm not considering? How big a deal is putting another "egg in the basket" by relying on Plex to handle another media type vs. diversifying into other applications?

Once the drive is filled I don't see myself using the drive unless I needed to for some reason or another. So my 2 questions are.
  
Would a HDD or a SDD be better for me with. Will there be any data loss if im not using them for long period of time after filling it up as I only need it as a back up storage.
 When I look at HDD I see the External drives like the Western Digital Easystore or Mybook. What would be the difference in one of those type of externals and just getting a hard drive and putting it into an enclosure?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I stumbled across grocy in this sub when looking for a solution to build a shared shopping list. While complete ERP seems overkill to me, I like the idea of automating the list. So it is installed and 60+ products in the database. 😂 However one aspect still bothers me: How do you manage one time items? E.g. a shop having a limited offer for clothing or tech? It would increase the wife acceptance factor by a lot if these items could also easiliy put on the shopping list.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the disk in my 5 year old 6x raidz2 array died and I bought a replacement for it, I went with a WD Red 6TB just because it is the same model as the other disks, I was not aware of the differences in SMR vs CMR, and of course it was not mentioned in the listing. Last night I added the new disk and let it resilver overnight, but it did bother me that in smartctl it has (SMR) in the name.
 So today after searching about it I found all this info about how bad the SMR disks are for raid and especially bad for raidz, this one article says it took them 9 days to resilver a 4TB Red, and i'm here confused because it only took 8hrs for my raidz2 (56% full) zpool, so I have to ask if they are that bad? should I avoid them if possible in the future?

 What is your use or need for a server at home?

 p.s. I guess I can use one to store hard drives for YouTube footage backup? But then again I use an old LTO5 drive for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since I know a decent amount of you probably use more than 6 sata ports, and have every single HDD slot filled (including the 5 1/4), I've been looking at the new AM5 platform and based on seeing what was removed, made me wonder if any of you would upgrade to it.
 I've noticed that with AM5, that if you want 8x sata ports, you need to buy 670e. However most of those only come with 2 x16 PCI 5 slots. Since I know some of you use some sort of Sata controller (probably either in a x1 or the x16 (4x) slot), how many would still upgrade, if you had to use the controller in the 2nd x16 slot (thus both now run at 8/8).

 I was using Onedrive for this. A python script used to copy the files into the onedrive subfolder, and I had enabled share on the folder and sent the link. That was when I was using my windows PC.
 I've since transitioned to a VM on Digital Ocean, and to use the Onedrive APIs I need to pay for a subscription and start an Azure account which I really don't want to do.
 Is there any free or self hosted option to achieve this?
 Thanks a lot!

 Looking to build a DIY nas to replace aging QNAP.
 Will be used as file server and backup. However, I also want to be able to spin up docker containers for OS, CI/CD self hosted agents, VS Code server etc.
 I’m a little confused and unsure if possible/how I can have TrueNAS setup for file serving, and have these home lab virtualisation flexibility, how I might split the storage pool to accommodate files and VMs, whether, with TrueNAS as OS I will still have access to the CLI to do docker builds etc?
 I feel I’m missing some basic understanding on how such requirements might be set up on a home lab.
 Grateful for any clarity!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I want to replace my 10 year old Qnap TS-212p NAS. In the past, I used to have the webGUI exposed to the internet, but because a lot of vulnerabilities were discovered, I disabled this.
 A couple of friends used the webGUI to save photo's to my NAS and I also used it a lot for link file sharing. This was my preferred way to share files over 30MB+. I can also use different internet services, but this is r/selfhosted :D
 I preferably don't want to expose the webGUI anymore, but I do want to share files via this NAS. I think a Synology would be the best option when I want to do this. Is there a something I'm missing as a potential option to share (and upload) files securely from the internet?
 //edit: Side-note. I'm not going to expose my home IP anymore. I have a site-to-site VPN running to a virtualized environment in a datacenter. When I'm going to expose it, I will use a reverse proxy in my datacenter environment, to access the webGUI of the NAS at my home network.

 But my pc would simply not see it…
 Can it be some kind of issues with the drive (3.3V) or is it just my old machine which is causing the issues?

I have several webcams (5-10 depending on motivation) inside of my network that I want to keep isolated within my network. The cams have both a snapshot URL, as well as a streaming URL, and I am centrally monitoring them internally with a MotionEye docker.
 I want to create a 'gallery' on my apache server that acts as a proxy for those URLs, and pipes the data to the web server. I don't want to expose the backend cams or docker at all.
 At one point I had a system set up that used ProxyPass, but I can't seem to find anything like that anymore.

 Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I'm kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)
 I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal
 I don't have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus
 Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant
 Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started. Does this sounds reasonable?
 Any other help of pointers you guys can give me are much appreciated

 Address is https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/
 I just ran into 429 so looking into how to get around that now.
 Is someone who is more experienced with backing up a site was able to give it a go as well?
 EDIT: Seems like the wayback machine has some of the forums backed up but ever post I tried to view was missing.

 I was looking up the Seagate Exos X16 14TB but many people commented its quite loud and they wouldn't put it in their main PC. Sadly, that's exactly what I want to do. 😅
 Are there any 14+ tb hdds that are also quiet but 7200prm? Hell, I may just go big and get 3. Preferably close to that ~$14/tb range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I thought I was getting the hang of it, but guess I was wrong so I need some help :)
 I have a nice media server setup at home with all the *arr apps, and a couple of other apps, all running with Docker. I would like to access one (or potentially more) of my services over VPN, by using a subdomain of my main domain, which in this case is domain.xyz.
 Let's say I want to access my Overseerr instance from the internet. My goal is to go to overseerr.lan.domain.xyz and be redirected to my docker container which is actually 10.0.0.51:9443.
 With that comes a few questions:
  
I need to setup the A record for my sub domain, but what IP address do I use for it? Do I need a DDNS service that will give me a domain to my router's (also the DNS at my home) IP?
 
Maybe related to the first question, do I need a local DNS server in my home?
 
What do I setup in NPM after creating the sub domain?
 
Where do SSL certs come into this and how do I utilize them in this setup?
 
 Thank you :)
 Edit:
 Forgot to mention VPN. I saw most people recommend WireGaurd and Tailscale, so I'll just check that out as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently shipped a tool for stupid easy self-hosting , but it's focused on the cloud, not on personal hardware. So I ran a poll in our community to see what people actually use to self-host.
 Here are the results:
 - In total, 810 votes were cast (about 0.4% of r/selfhosted members)
 - The most popular option is "From a dedicated server/self-hosting machine at home" - 616 votes 
 - Next up is "With a big cloud provider (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc" - 79 votes (about 10%)
 - "From my own personal device (PC, laptop, Mac, etc)" - 62 votes
 - "With a small local/community cloud" - 21 votes
 The rest had other options in mind (check out comments under the original poll)
 Takeaway: I might need to add the option to self-host on your own hardware to my product. Will work on that then. There's already some indication of what hardware people use (Raspberry Pis, old laptops, Unraid and custom servers..), but a more detailed review calls for another poll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know I'm going to get ripped apart for this but here goes. Among other forms of data hoarding, I'm also a tab hoarder. I had like 600 tabs open on my Chrome on my android phone. 2+ years of "oh, this looks interesting/useful. I'll look at this later.."
 Some of it was probably just crap, but I had lots of important stuff open too. Stupid I know, should have used bookmarks and sync to backup or something. It was on my to-do list to get the backup sorted, but I didn't get around to it. Procrastination. I accidentally clicked "clear all data" and it's all gone. I've felt shitty all weekend, not even joking. How pathetic is that, I know. Can't stop thinking about the stuff I've lost (or more specifically, the stuff I don't know that I lost, which is 10x worse). Nobody else understands.. Know it sounds melodramatic and ridiculous but that's how I feel. Think this is probably one of the only places on the internet who understands the feeling, everyone I've mentioned it to is just like "so what?"

 It has to have a self-cleaning base and be fairly good at avoiding obstacles. My place is 90% laminate wood floors and a couple rugs (with a rug pad underneath). Mopping really isn't critical.

 Whilst the ideal would be some way of sharing it to his tv, I know this is impossible without another device which adds a whole new UI problem. That leaves me with pc to pc, which I'm thinking something like google drive might be the simplest, but even that will be a learning curve.

The editor should simple and easy to use so that my wife also can use it for here notetaking.
 The most important thing is that the I am able to open the notes in any other markdown editor and that I can later replace the editor and just point to the same folder(s). I.e. I need an editor that works on actual markdown files rather than storing the content of the files in a database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm here because I have a small problem and can't find a solution googling online.
 I have a server in my LAN, it's configured with Ubuntu Server 20.04 and Docker, and everything runs on Docker.
 I have Traefik V2.8 as a reverse proxy.
 At the moment, my domain is linked with my house ip address, but I wanted to change that to be more relaxed in letting my friends use services like Nextcloud and Searxng or pihole around the world, so I bought a VPS (the $1 one from IONOS, with 1VCore and 512MB RAM) with the idea of creating a VPN connection and routing the HTTPS traffic to my LAN.
 Problem is, it's not working and I don't know why.
 If I put Traefik in network_mode: service behind the Wireguard container, I can ping the VPS Wireguard container from it, but I don't know how to route the traffic from the VPS to Traefik and make Traefik accept it.
 I tried with NGINX on the VPS, but the proxy_pass isn't working.
 I configured it like that:
 server { listen 80; listen 443; location / { proxy_pass http://10.13.13.2; } } 
 10.13.13.2 is the IP of the Wireguard container on my home server. 
 Also, I have to implement the same thing for a friend who can't open ports on their modem (that's why I'm not using other stuff like the docker overlay network). 
 Another configuration could be running Traefik on the VPS, and reverse-proxying to containers through VPN to solve the problem of having to proxy stuff through NGINX to Traefik, but in this case I have absolutely no idea how to connect Traefik on the VPS to the docker network at home... 
 Thank you in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've long been using these mini PCs as my home router. The current gen on Amazon for reference ..
 https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-ZBOX-N3160-DDR3L-1600-SATAIII/dp/B01N95X5KH/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=zotac%2Bmini%2Bpc&qid=1664674168&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjEyIiwicXNhIjoiNS4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjMuMzQifQ%3D%3D&s=electronics&sprefix=zotac%2Bmini%2Celectronics%2C158&sr=1-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&th=1
 I just install linux on one of these, configure routing / firewall / dhcp / etc. It hits the sweet spot for me, small, silent, dual ethernet ports. I don't care about the wifi and keep it disabled.
 Now I have occasion to run IEEE 1588 / PTP on my network. I'd like to host the grandmaster clock on my router. However, the box I have (slightly older version of the link above) does not support hardware timestamping on the ethernet NIC.
 ​
 0 % ethtool -T enp2s0 # the other interface shows the same capabilities Time stamping parameters for enp2s0: Capabilities: software-transmit software-receive software-system-clock PTP Hardware Clock: none Hardware Transmit Timestamp Modes: none Hardware Receive Filter Modes: none 
 ​
 I'm looking at new hardware, and I'd like to get something very similar to what I already have, but with a newer ethernet chipset / support for 1588 HW timestamping. I've had a really difficult time determining, for the candidate hardware, whether the onboard NIC will have this capability.
 Any suggestions?

 I'm looking to build a more proper rack based homelab for VM's, NAS and networking but my office is upstairs and basically full and my NBN node is actually in my garage so it seems my only option is to set the rack up in my garage.
 Is there anyone here from Australia and more specifically in a more humid climate like QLD who has their lab in their garage? and if so is there anything extra that should be done? My garage is extremely clean and only other purpose is for my gym setup and a freezer so it should be a nice environment for it.

As an IT engineer I just wanted a place on the web that I could see my notes wherever I was. Unfortunately, after 12 years of keeping it up, I can't afford it anymore. It will cost £95.99 again this year, I can't fault Krystal Hosting as their customer support has always been really good. I just can't justify paying that this year.
 I'm going to speak to them to see if I can possibly get a cheaper package but I was thinking of just hosting it myself on and off. So it won't be on all the time. I have a spare Raspberry Pi that I could stick it on. Just don't know how easy it is to host your own wordpress site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have an almost unused
  
HP Z220 Intel Xeon E-1240 V2 CMT
 32GB RAM
 256GB SSD for OS
 6TB x 3 for NAS
 4TB x 2 for backups.
  
Is this good for a Homelab virtual server + NAS.
 I am not into gaming or video editing. I will probably run Emby or Plex for media and will run 2 - 3 Windows VMs for family members and two Linux VMs as my dev server.
 I am planning to install Proxmox on it. It will be running a couple of VMs ( windows 10 pro + Linux Mint) and a TrueNAS instance severing as NAS. I am wondering if this config will be able to handle this workload.
 I am pretty new to all this. So bear with me if I have a few things backwards.

 I tried homechart, but the requirement on a 3rd party account for a locally hosted server, along with the massively large ads asking me to subscribe, quickly made it a no-go.

 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i'm looking for something that is standalone (basically I don't want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I'm looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can't use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

First of all, all of the posts I can find about it are from the creator of it, and everything is in Chinese. The user interface seems very outdated(think ESXI but 10x worse and slower). And instead of asking for an API Key for hypervisor integration, it asks for the ROOT password.
 ​
 Also even though they accept commercial payments, they don't have any copyright (at least that I can find) or a entry in the Better Business Bureau database. There website https://www.deskpool.com/ is also sketchy (at least it feels like it with everything else) with basically 0 documentation to speak of. 
 Has anyone actually deployed this before? If so has anything been weird?

 I have an Oracle instance running a couple of apps, with nginx Proxy Manager, proxied through Cloudflare, with Auth0 handling the auth. It all works fine, except for the firewall rules in Oracle. I have all of the Cloudflare IPs and Auth0 allowed on the firewall, but I can't get beyond authentication unless I have a 0.0.0.0/0 rule in the firewall.
 Does anyone have tips on how to pinpoint the issue? It's my first time dealing with this combo of services, and I thought I had everything done correctly, but obviously not!
 Thanks.

 I have a mylastname.tld domain and am planning to host multiple services via docker (publicly but only for personal use) and make them available via subdomains via Caddy reverse proxy. I am pondering whether to use my aforementioned domain like for example git.mylastname.tld or to use other formats like git.home.mylastname.tld or another main domain (instead of mylastname) altogether.
 This is not about the technical realisations, these are clear to me, just curiosity about how others organise and use their domains or if there is something like a best practice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would like to do something similar to this, but using nomad.
 If I understand correctly the nomad documentation I have to setup a CNI network for this. This is my config right now:
 json { "name": "mynet", "cniVersion": "0.4.0", "plugins": [ { "type": "bridge", "isDefaultGateway": true, "ipMasq": true, "ipam": { "type": "host-local", "ranges": [ [ { "subnet": "172.22.0.0/16" } ] ] } } ] } 
 Nomad parses the config, gives no error message. So far so good. Now here is my job file for pihole:
 ```hcl job "pihole" { datacenters = ["dc1"]
 group "pihole" {
 network { mode = "cni/mynet" port "http" { static = 80 to = 80 } port "DNS" { static = 53 to = 53 } } task "pihole" { driver = "docker" env { TZ = "Europe/Budapest" VIRTUAL_HOST = "pi.hole" PROXY_LOCATION = "pi.hole" FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 = "127.0.0.1" WEBPASSWORD = "piholepass" } config { image = "pihole/pihole:latest" ports = ["http", "DNS"] ipv4_address = "172.22.0.2" volumes = [ "/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole", "/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d", ] } } 
 } }
 ```
 If I use network.mode = "bridge" and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine. However this version starts up normally, but it can not reach the internet:
  [✗] DNS resolution is currently unavailable 
 I have checked that CNI takes care of routing, the proper nat tables show up with ifconfig.
 Any idea how should I fix this? Anything else to check?

 But since we are talking 500 files this would take a long time.
 Is there an easier faster way with which i can download all the wav's in bulk? I know python if that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have gotten very interested in citrix storefront (web ui) and citrix desktop (Essentially bringing a vm to another device). Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM's or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. 
 Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can't be the whole solution because it can't autocreate/allocate VM's for users and doesn't shutdown when not not in use. Doesn't help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can't auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically
 I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly. But sometimes I wish I could just spin up a VM with an easier user interface or create a new user with a VM already allocated that could be connected to easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old gaming rig, some new hard drives, a list of things I'd like a personal home server for, and a few steps missing in terms of actually getting everything up and running.
 First is the OS, I'm thinking Debian since I'm more familiar with Debian based stuff than others, but if there's better options I'm up to learn.
 The next stumbling bock is that I'm vaguely aware of containerization being good for things like the game servers and probably an Element instance I want to have but I have no idea where to even begin with that. Is it a "definitely do this", "good practice but not strictly necessary", or "you're probably not gonna need it" sort of thing?
 The last is backups and storage. I've never actually done a proper network share before with Linux, but I'd like to. I've been using an external drive and Timeshift for backups, but it looks like it's more geared towards non-network backups. Is that a problem that should sort itself out once I get a proper share set up or should I probably be using something else?
 Those are my questions. I welcome all help and suggestions you got for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Just published a pretty big list of tools, categorized and organized into sections (Engineering, Marketing, Operations, and so on). Took quite a lot of time, and I incorporated tools from all sources I could find. 
 The stats are as follows:
 - 364 tools in total, out of these
 - 229 are open-source
 - 19 are fair-code (licenses that e.g. disallow commercial use, like Elastic license) 
 - 45 are proprietary with easy export options (mostly for reference)
 It's also easy to submit new tools there if anything's missing. Hope these serve as inspiration, there are also links to websites and I plan to add direct links to docs so you can jump to self-host any of those quickly. Hope you like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might interest some of you. SanDisk has a lifetime warranty on a lot of their flash media, including MicroSD cards, which I have a lot of for various uses. Their cards don't fail on me often, but a couple times now, it's happened. The first instance, my MicroSD card was replaced with another unit of the one that failed, as expected. But this recent failure was a 200GB card, and I guess they didn't have any more 200GB cards laying around, because they sent me a 400GB card to replace it. Pretty good stuff.
 tl;dr SanDisk is real good with their warranties. Take advantage of them if you have the chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people want to use a computer in a room other than the PC is in. That's where these various keywords come in: Remote desktop / KVM over IP / 100ft+ HDMI cable.
 Overall: this is a niche market. higher lag uses are allegedly mostly covered by RDP. I am going to put my gaming PC at my TV and any office work will hopefully be within the cheaper, laggier options like RDP.
 Here's a summary of some things you can search for.
 Remote desktop / RDP
  
requires windows pro or similar
 presumably laggier than a direct wire solution
  
Non RDP software solutions
  
teamviewer
 anydesk ($120/year) https://anydesk.com/en/order
 p2p https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/p2p
 supremo https://www.supremocontrol.com/pricing/

Pi-kvm
  
1080p50 (not a typo) x1 monitor
 $275 assembled + needed parts (power supply)
  
bliKVM
  
uses pikvm
 lives in pcie?
 https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Thunderbolt docks + Corning optical thunderbolt
  
$550ish for cable. additional dock cost
 hand assembled in clean rooms
  
Level1techs KVM
  
not directly relevant but good KVMs are hard to come by
 can't vouch for it but has the right buzzwords
 https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-usbc-model
 he mentions around the 5m mark in the video that you can use a pi-kvm to chain a non-IP KVM over IP. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsznhIBPMc
  
Keywords to look for:
  
optical
 fiber
 KVM
 KVM over IP
 KVM over copper
 HDMI over ethernet
 thinclient
 hdBaseT
 displayport (seems to support more than HDMI)
 note the differences between displayport 1.2, 1.4 etc. and the daisy chain possibilities in there.

 So im doing some research on how events affect donation behaviour. I hope to match news coverage of a specific area with donations to its main NGO. I have the donations data - but I need to figure out to how to scrap data on news for this location (its usually on the news worldwide). What I mostly need is: date of news, is it generally positive or negative, and country(If possible). To some extent also "intensity" of coverage. Any ideas where I could start ? Pretty new on coding so maybe worth mentioning that

 ​
 Parse NGINX -- I use SWAG-- reverse proxy logs (access, error) and fail2ban logs, save the data into a PostgreSQL database, and generate neat reports, maps, and more. Note that adding locations to parsed IP addresses requires the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 BeatLog!
 Some features I'm proud of and use:
  
Rapidly parses log lines into useful data
 Characterize IP addresses as "Home" or "Outside", based on server's current public IP address.
 Assess outside visitors by location, and other useful metrics
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren't found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names
 Make fun maps
  
​
 Check it out if it appeals to you, and please submit any bugs you find or feedback you consider. As linked in the bullets above, I've tried to put some effort into the documentation to get a user started. Thanks!

It was getting close to capacity so I picked up 3 more 14TB hard drives a few weeks ago during a sale. I have a total of 4 14TB HDDs now, 1 basically full. I've also got a 10TB synology DS220+ I back up critical files to that's mostly empty. 
 I was thinking about going with single disk parity on TruNAS or Unraid. I'd set it up first with the 3 new drives and copy all my media over from my desk. Then I'd shuck the WD and add it to my server. I'd then then compress everything to a backup archive once a week and send it to my synology server (I can add 1 more drive to this if needed). 
 Thoughts on the setup? Also advice on TruNAS vs Unraid would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help and have a lot of questions. I am unsure how to keep home network access fast, remote access secure and privacy for my traffic. 
 Currently running OMV + Linux based machine with docker (plex, arrs, vpn etc) but I want to move to a Proxmox host with VMs + containers. I acquired a Dell 730 for a killer price and will be moving to that in about 2 weeks. 
 I want to allow access to plex and something for plex requests to 3 users remotely. These 3 users will only ever access those two plex focused services. 
 I also want to expose about 10-15 services including the two plex ones above to 3 different users. Does this mean I need 2 different dashboards/sites for each user group?
 I thought maybe a reverse proxy (traefik) with authentication? (Authelia) put services behind wireguard to link to my VPN? Do I need something to handle certificates? Lets encrypt ? Cloud flare tunnels? So confused. 
 What's the least complex way to do this and what order do I go in (maybe Traefik then wireguard then ???) Trying to figure out the boot/compose order so everything is ready before the next service starts up. Right

 In my quest to replace the seductive tools from GAFAMs in my (and my relatives) mobile/computer ecosystem with self-hosted ones, I want to replace whatsapp. After some research, matrix-synapse coupled with the element client, seems to be a good option.
 If any of you have succeeded in setting up something similar to what I'm trying to do, have tips, suggestions, leads or answers, then I'm interested :)
 Some personal constraints :
  
No domain name bought for the moment, I don't want to depend on any external service, we'll see if this choice will last in time (I also plan to host my DNS server)
 Hosting on a home server on a modest ADSL connection, the upload speed is therefore very low, but I intend to make with it at least for the whole test phase and then eventually mov…]]></summary>

 Jellyfin, Sonarr, Bazarr, Radarr, qbittorrent, Adguard Home, Watchtower, Syncthing, Portainer
  
Only 2 things I use from Synology Package Manager is SMB Share and Tailscale for remote access.
 And I also require a Windows VM where I'll need a USB passthrough which Trunas scale and core didnt offer, which made me switch to Xpenology.
  
Downside I ran into is Jellyfin Transcoding requires Nvidia driver to be 470 or above, Xpenology only offers 440.44 with no way to upgrade.
 So I'm looking for a Free OS or Hypervisor, that allows me to run every thing i have now in Docker containers and also offers me HW transcending in Jellyfin using Nvidia, plus allows me USB passthrough in VM and remote access with Tailscale.
 Thank you in advance.

 I've tried looking online but searching "Wookieepedia archive" only gives fandom articles on archives which exist in the SW universe.
 I just despise the fandom website so much that I wanted my own copy of the old Wookieepedia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. 
 Hope this is the right spot to ask....
 So, today some weird things started happening on my network. All the apps that rely on "outside access" (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan <-> router (pppoe) <-> lan <-> nginx reverse proxy <-> apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns "autobots".
 In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started "falling off" from my services. My phone wouldn't sync with NextCloud, people's locations didn't update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if "my" domains were "listed" on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren't propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).
 I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.
 Does anyone know what's going on? Anyone experiencing similar things?
 Thanks in advance.

I don’t have 5 of any version of Raspberry Pi and it would be cost prohibitive to do so. And since demand is high for Pi’s…
 The thin clients I’m looking at have AMD quad core processors (2.4 GHz) and come with 8GB RAM and 64GB SSDs. Power consumption is typically around 15W and being x86, I’ll never have to worry about finding compatible Docker images. Best of all, they’re going for around $50 each, so my existing Pi collection - even selling them for less than the crazy top-dollar prices currently found on eBay - should pay for 5 thin clients. (That’s important because I’m currently unemployed and can’t add any $ to make this happen.)
 Does this seem like a good idea to you? If not, why not?
 Thanks for your time and consideration!

 ​
 Now planning to move the setup to a new machine with i5-9300U and Nvidia 1660Ti (6GB) machine with 16GB(can upgrade to 32GB as well) ram. I want to run the services that can also take advantage of the graphic card. So here are my questions
  
Is windows going to be better in terms of docker/services taking advantage of graphics? (I know docker in windows is VM whereas docker in linux run natively)
 I do see instructions to make docker use Nvidia graphics using NVIDIA container toolkit. Do they also apply to docker desktop? 
 Asking the above questions because it seems to be easy to manage docker containers through docker desktop app instead of old method
 
 Please suggest the services for photo/videos & surveillance that can use my hardware optimally (both CPU and GPU) to render the content. 
 So far I have only seen Jellyfin that I can make it use the graphic card for video rendering and it worked great.
 
 Also suggest if there is any service other than Nextcloud(pi) that is better and can complement Jellyfin/Photoprism 
 Seafile is not for me because of it's block based storage which makes it hard to backup my data to a cloud

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 28TB in a Synology 5-bay NAS, and am reaching reasonable limits to upgrading within the five bays, so I was considering just building a custom NAS in an old PC case and running my storage/Plex of TrueNAS (haven't decided yet fully). The current drives are all still good and I would like to reuse them, but the data is stored in an SHR raid. I have a cloud backup in Synology's proprietary's HyperBackup format.
 Is there a smart way of moving my data onto the new system once I have it set up, or do I need to download the backup data and hope all works out with the Synology backup explorer (which I can only really test once I've deleted the original SHR data off the hard drives)?

 Is there another way to do this? i also have dropbox acct, is there a way to do it with that? i want the files to reside on my HD and just be synced/backed up to a cloud folder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am running a single Proxmox server with a few LXCs and VMs. 
 On this, I have a single Ubuntu VM that acts as my main virtualized server for all my docker services. I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. 
 The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.
 This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I'd like to play with kubernetes a bit. I've already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.
 However, I still don't understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I'd assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.
 If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.
 Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server? Is the increased complexity worth it anyhow?
 Thanks in advance!

 I mean stuff like, overall file corruption or that it didnt cut out in the middle of the episode (sth like autocompare the length to tvdb)
 Whats the best way to check for this (besides going through everything manually) bc the data it would need is already there. 
 Does a program for that already exist?
