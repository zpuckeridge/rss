        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title states, I recently purchased an old HP DL585 G7 to use as a game server. It is posting saying only 8 active cores per chip when it should be 12. Is this something similar to the bulldozer cpu debacle with amd, (Claimed 8 core on a 4 core chip) or is there a bios setting I might be able to access to utilize all cores on all 4 chips?
 Also, is there a way to set the fan speed? It's a bit loud sitting on my desk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using WikiJS for my documentation and such.
 Things I like about WikiJS:
 - Plenty of customization/administration
 - Syncs plain text to S3 storage (using Cloudflare R2)
 Things I don't like about it:
 - Clunky UI, interface, and editor
 - Pages are slow to render
 - Half of the features are "coming soon"
 - Directory structure/hierarchy/navigation is difficult to use properly (at least for me)
 ​
 I was thinking of moving to Bookstack. I already have this installed from when I was testing a few other solutions.
 I've heard issues with Bookstack breaking URL's, is that still an issue I should be worried about?
 I've also heard that if the Bookstack docker/OS dies/corrupts, the data is useless because it uses a database and not plain text. If I sync my docs to S3 storage, are they stored in plain text there or will I need the database? My goal is to be able to have access to all of my documentation if my entire environment collapses. Having plain text files in Cloudflare R2 achieves that goal.
 ​
 *Please do not suggest Obsidian, Joplin, Trilium, etc. as I've tried them all. The only one I still want to try is Outline Wiki, but the setup is too complex just to set up for testing purposes.

 2 Days later, while trying to add another drive to my array, this drive starts throwing out errors every second. I reached out to the vendor who said they'd replace it no problem. Trouble is, the drive has highly sensitive data, and DBAN fails when trying to scrub. How comfortable would you be at that point sending the drive back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got my first rack and after some blunders got everything together. It's not obnoxiously loud most of the time, but its noticeable in the background. Got a Dell R620 with dual E5-2643 V2 chips. I read someone had mentioned Mass Loaded Vinyl as an option and I wanted to know if anyone had experience creating a "wall" out of one for the sides of the rack, and if that actually dampened the volume. I thought about using the insert holes on the sides of the rack to affix a panel to the side.
 ​
 Secondly, I grabbed a static rack kit from dell not quite realizing what static really implied, which wouldn't be a huge deal but when I attempted to remove the server, I can pull it out about 6 inches and then it almost seems to catch on something and won't come out further. Anyone experience that, is that normal? I pretty much have to remove the rails and make sure there is lots of clearance around the rack if I ever want to take it out all the way (and I'm dreading the thought).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all,
 A while back I got started using terraform to create/manage VMs on my proxmox homelab (thank you to those of you who have shared blog posts about this). 
 One thing that bothered me was how I was essentially copy/pasting the resource definitions when I wanted to create a new VM, so I recently went through a big refactor to reduce the amount of configuration required to create a new vm and wanted to share with this community in case others find it useful. With this setup I can now define a new VM with three lines of yaml, push my changes and have them deployed by the gitlab ci/cd pipeline. 
 https://github.com/nohbdy1745/proxmox-terraform 
 I have this deployed on a gitlab instance running in a proxmox VM, with gitlab managing my terraform state, and have the gitlab ci/cd pipeline setup so I can push changes to my terraform configuration and have them deployed from there. I set it up so that you don't need to have gitlab managed terraform state, you would just have to change the backend in main.tf and you can use the make commands to run everything. 
 Hope this is useful to someone else. I'm also not an expert with terraform so if you happen to take a look and have feedback please let me know!

 Basically I have a couple of external drives for cold storage that take up space and I want to chuck them into my case. I was going to shuck them but leave the USB to SATA logic board intact and route the USB and AC power cable through PCIe slot into the case. Unfortunately the logic board prevents the drives from being mounted properly in my Node 304 case (also, somehow my WD Reds and another Seagate drive only support 3 screw mounts? Did Fractal mess up?).

 selfhost/docker Beginner here. I already got some applications running, yay!
 But I´m currently stuck with hosting a mail/smtp application. I already tried the docker-mailserver, mailcow and as webinterfaces rainloop and sogo. But to be quite honest I am a little bit stunned by the complexity (a lot of services, ports,...) and amount of errors I am getting. I got not a single option to run correctly. I don´t know where to start.
 For me the topic selfhosted mail is the next logical step, because a lot of applications require an smtp server.
 So, had anyone a similar experience? Can someone recommend a proper, simple image or guide? What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I’ve been looking for a new analog transfer device for a while to transfer hi-8 and VHS tapes. I bought a cheap easy-cap like device, and it sucked. It was causing a lot of artifacting, frame drops, highlight blowout and just something I wouldn’t trust to transfer several hours worth of important footage.
 With Christmas around the corner, I’ve decided to treat myself with a good quality transfer device. Only problem is, I can’t find the right one. Most of the suggestions I’ve found online and on Reddit are extremely dated or way too advanced for my current setup.
 I’ve heard good things about the Hauppage HD PVR, elgato analog capture, and black magic intensity shuttle cards, but so many people have suggested different approaches that I don’t know which one to try. Everything from TBCs, scalers, passthroughs, to PCIs, I don’t even know if I’m getting the right thing.
 I want to get a good quality device that I can use with my laptop and camcorder without having to drop hundreds of bucks and uproot my entire setup. My main goal is to save these videos to a digital format while losing as little of the picture quality as possible. I’d greatly appreciate any suggestions for what I should invest in.

 I've managed to fumble my way through cloudflare zero tier to add GitHub as an identity provider, but how do I restrict which github accounts can access my tunnel - at the minute every account can log in. Is this even possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current homeserver is getting too small.
 I currently have a board that barely holds my GPU and ssd extension card. For future plans I need a mainboard that has more slots but I wonder if there is any workstation focused mainboard out there. Or are the gaming mainboards already the best to get when it comes to connectivity?
 ​
 The scenario:
 I have a server that runs Proxmox. I then have a bunch VMs/containers for my workload. All pretty basic except the gaming VM. I passthroguh my GPU, mouse and keyboard and connect to a screen.
 I might need more connectivity for that vm. E.g. to handle sound easily. I was thinking to buy a Thunderbolt extension card, also give that to the VM and then simply connect a docking station to it and be good. But for that I need at least one more card in the system... which does not fit currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a very basic server with Oracle Cloud free tier, and I managed to use Cloudflare and Nginx Proxy Manager to reroute my subdomains with the certifications and everything. However, the only way I get it to work is to expose each container port in my ingress rules on the Oracle server. 
 To my understanding (noob here), the idea of using Nginx is to be able just to expose the usual ports (80, 443) and let the rerouting to go behind that, without the need to expose rest of ther ports. Am I correct?
 I'm not sure what additional information I could give to help solve the issue, let me know if there is anything I can add.
 Thanks in advance for the support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Pretty much as per the title. Need a CRM to handle VERY simple tasks for software tech support. Basically need to be able to create some customers, associate them to incoming email addresses from our support address (simple SMTP/IMAP), create support items specific to them (usually stemming from said emails), assign to a team member, flag them as complete, etc, etc. Nothing too crazy, small 3-5 person team. Played with self-hosted Oodo but looks like way overkill and only one "app" for free version so that looks to end that scheme. PLayed with SuiteCRM but I seemed to be getting random errors, lag, etc (this was on a Windows install with XAMPP).
 Any thoughts, even if cloud based but free (if that exists) I suppose would work. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm going to try.
 I have a 14TB WD easystore that's been working for just over a year now. Yesterday, I noticed it was mounting and unmounting rapidly, so I ejected it and restarted the computer. 
 When I turned the computer back on it would no longer mount, the discs aren't spinning and there was a slow, white flashing from the LED indicator. I immediately looked up all the troubleshooting guides and did the following. 
  
Switched USB cables (used my other easystore's usb)
 plugged into a dedicated wall outlet
 checked windows device manager and un-checked "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" - restarted pc
 opened disc management, where it is not visible and there is no drive letter for it at all
 updated drivers 
 allowed hidden items in serial bus drivers
  
After frustration I stopped everything all together. This morning I plugged it in and there is still no disc spinning activity, and now the LED blinks rapidly. Is this thing bricked? I have 13.9 TBs on it and would really hate to lose it all. I had it propped up on fans and it was well maintained, and of course there is no power or reset button on these things.
 Any suggestions? It's still warrantied for another year. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have personal data (general, plus DSLR and GoPro photos/videos for Lightroom/Final Cut Pro), business data (including lots of big image files, say 1GB per file, 200GB currently), and my computer setup to back up. I don't generally save images/videos on my internal SSD.
 My current setup looks like this:
  
2TB external HD for photo/video storage 2.5"
 5TB external HD for business data storage 2.5"
 I also have a 2TB external SSD for temporary photo/video storage for faster editing. This only ever contains duplicates from the 2TB HD
 4TB external HD for backing up both the 2TB and the 5TB external HDs (yeah, the 4TB was here first, when I had 2x 2TB, but my business 2TB failed so I upgraded that to a 5TB... thus the stupid size relations)
 1TB time machine external HD for backing up my Mac setup/internal SSD
 iDrive Cloud for backing up my Time Machine, 2TB photo and 5TB business HD.
  
​
 Problem: My photo/video 2TB external HD is getting really full, only 10% space left... I started taking more videos, which take up a huge amount of space.
 Now I'm really torn as to how to smartly upgrade my backup setup.
  
Should I get a big external HD, maybe 6TB, to replace the current stupid 4TB backup HD, and use the 4TB backup HD for photos and videos instead?(I could even use the 4TB just for videos, leave my photos on the current 2TB photo/video HD). If so, should I get a 2.5" or 3.5" for the 6TB? I don't really need to move it, it should stay on my desk, but is there still an advantage to 3.5" these days at all?
 Or should I rather get a second smallish (2TB) external HD to put the videos on, so that the current photo/video HD only contains photos, and leave the backup 4TB as is for now?
  
​
 Trying to save money atm, but also want a sustainable solution...
 Which option do you suggest and why?
 Feel free to also add other sensible options that I'm missing here!
 ​
 Thanks so much!

 Does anyone know if there are any programs like stash that i can use to acess my downloaded youtube videos from my web browser on my lan in an aesthetically pleasing way?
 I do not want to use plex as while i have that setup and it is good on the tv i would love something a bit more browser focussed for accessing in web browsers on my computers to go along with stash, calibre, kiwix, sonarr, radarr etc.

 I installed both Proxmox and Ubuntu without any problem, but when I try to boot I just can't.
 I disabled secure boot from the BIOS settings and enabled Legacy mode, I downgraded BIOS firmware, but nothing worked.
 The computer previously had a 1TB hard disk, I installed Ubuntu on it and it won't boot either.
 Before I formatted the hard disk had Windows on it and it worked. My thoughts are that maybe the computer has some Linux block, so it can't boot Linux.
 Is there someone who maybe had the same issue and can help me?
 Thanks!

 TLDR: What do you use for your home NAS (OS or Appliance)? Do you have a separate computer/server to run apps and use your NAS for storage?
 A few months ago, I switched from OMV to TrueNAS SCALE. I wanted stability and ease of use for my NAS because my family also relies on my NAS. I found OMV to be buggy, and not intuitive. In my opinion, I could not trust OMV. Now I am considering going back to OMV.
 TrueNAS SCALE has been great for me, at least if I used the very basic features of having a ZFS pool with a few SMB/NFS shares, but I wanted to run apps as well, such as Plex, Nextcloud, etc..., but that has been the biggest hassle for me, and I miss being able to use Docker Compose and apps just working.

 Here is a brief about my condition - 
  
I have hosted my services on a raspberry pi.
 
I got a static IP with tailscale.
 
I am using Nginx-proxy-manager to manage domains and mapping.
 
Goal is to map my domain (purchased off go daddy) to be mapped with my tailscale account/device so that I can set up multiple sub-domains for my different services.
 
 I apologise if this question sounds a bit noob. I am fairly new to the Selfhosting side of the world!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if anyone here archives games, or has experience with Minecraft, but is there any way to have a Minecraft launcher, such as the titan launcher, for offline use? What I mean is, if you use the titan launcher you still have to download any version you might want to play. What I'm looking for is a launcher that already has ALL Minecraft versions built in so I can just play it wherever and whenever and require no internet connection whatsoever. I want this for purposes of archiving the game on an external HDD, since I'm a big data hoarder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to take some time and rave about Frigate NVR. I just installed it a couple days ago on home assistant and wow. For my personal use, It blows Agent DVR (Which I had been using for several months) out of the water. Here are some of my favorite points:
  
Accuracy is phenomenal for AI detections. This was always an issue with Agent DVR for me. It would detect my oil tank and christmas lights as people with up to 80% confidence level. Even sunset shadows it would be up to 70% confident it was people. By the time I masked these out almost 1/2 of the screen was gone. Zero false positives so far with Frigate and no masks.
 Clips are so smooth.
 CPU (Not using Coral) usage is extremely low and getting 15 to 19ms inference times on Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 (Running HAOS Arm64 as a Hyper-V VM on Windows Dev Kit 2023). This is something I could not have said when I was running Agent DVR. AI detection with CodeProject.AI was usually hitting 40-60% CPU utilization on a 12 core i5 1240p. Agent DVR always idled at around 12% CPU utilization.

I watched Cooptonioan's video but that only covers disabling MFA for the local network whereas my goal would be to trust anyone that connects from the local network (thus disabling authentication) which is absolutely needed for the wife acceptance factor. How can this be achieved?
 PS setup was done based on GeeksCircuit guide.

 I have a few os options, originally i was going to install proxmox ve, truenas, home assistant, ubuntu for docker containers, windows ect. I would like to just run windows server as a host os because if there is an issue in windows there is a much higher chance of me being able to fix it on my own without hours of googleing. I would like to have a standard smb share for my files, raid 10 6 hdd probably, but i would also like some sort of web interface that i can upload or download files from if i can't use smb for whatever reason. I have been told by people that storage spaces in windows is a nightmare though.
 Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the opportunity to buy around 50 500GB HDDs still sealed in their original packaging (about USD 4.50 per drive), and was wondering if it would be worth getting any. 
 Based on this thread, it seems that the best use would be to just (re)sell the drives or offer upgrade services; and that building something with them would be quite inefficient due to high power requirements relative to the storage space available. Any other ideas on what else could be done with these drives? Or would those two suggestions still be the best advice today? 
 Also, these drives are somewhat old (manufactured 2015, ~7 years ago). If the HDDs have been factory sealed all this time, would they still be very likely to work, or would there be some form of degradation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am selfhosting a lot of services like plex, nextcloud, adguard, ... and I would like to have good perf for R/W for the services.
 Specs: - I have multiple proxmox host for HA (like Dell optiplex) - I use the ZFS features (so this storage will be on ZFS). - Storage should be on 10Gb 
 I think all the virtual disks would be on this new storage but there is a problem because I need : - SSD (good perf) for virtual disks of VMs - HDD for data (like movies, doc, pic, ...)
 --> So I think I would go with 2 zfs pools
 My questions are : - Which bay storage (with ECC Ram) should I use for my case ? SAN, NAS, DAS ? - What's the size of your pool and what kind of disk? - Where are your virtual disk, host side or dedicated storage reachable via NFS ? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an app to real-time receive and plot sensor data (through TCP, sent by MCU with wifi) and save them for future analyzing. Like a PC oscilloscope.
 The features I need are: 1. Real-time receive and plotting 2. Data source can be TCP socket or named pipe (whatever as long as I can write a python script to be a middle converter) 3. Allow me to select a x-axis range to save a part of received data
 I've tried: - PulseView (can't real-time continuously receive) - LabPlot (KDE) (can't select a part of received data to save. And easy to crash) - Audacity (which is a sound wave editing software. Good for range selecting, but, can't set real-time data source to be other than mic. And can't show the wave if Y value larger than 1)
 Thank you guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been poking around trying to find a solution for archiving threads from various automotive forums. For anyone who doesn't use these forums, they have been dying over the years as people move to other social media platforms and with the decline in usage comes a decline in maintenance. Sometimes all the images disappear, videos get removed, or whole forum domains go down. Most of what's on these forums isn't super useful but there's a handful of threads showing highly custom stuff that is relevant to my own projects.
 I would like to be able to archive a thread in its entirety for later reference to include images, videos, and other links. I played around with ArchiveBox some and archiving with a link depth of 1 seems to gather all that, but also grabs all the other irrelevant links that are on a forum page that I don't care for. I also can only archive a thread one page at a time using ArchiveBox, which doesn't work for threads that might go on for hundreds of pages.
 I did some research and I think what I am looking for is a web scraper tool that can snag all the thread posts and associated links on a page, then cycle to the next page in the thread and repeat until all the pages have been archived....so with all that being said I am looking for recommendations for tools that might fit this use case.
 Since I don't think there's much overlap between self hosters and people who frequent the forums (though I might be wrong) here are two links of example threads that I would love to make sure I have indefinite access to (so long as I maintain my homelab).
  
Example 1
 Example 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if anybody else is having this problem: I'm one of the hosts of mintCast, I also manage the mintCast.org web server on a raspberry pi in my basement. In addition to that I host a Nextcloud instance that we use for our infrastructure. Though I've got Nextcloud running on bare metal, I've got the collabora server running in a docker container on the same machine. All of this is sitting behind and Nginx reverse proxy manager which itself is running in a docker container. The problem I'm having is when I try to embed calendars from next cloud onto the WordPress site I get an error on next cloud saying it cannot copy the HTML code to the clipboard. All of the SSL is sorted. Everything behind the reverse proxy has a self-signed certificate which the proxy trusts and then Nginx handles the external stuff with let's encrypt. I've also noted that I cannot copy and paste directly onto next cloud office documents. At least not with the mouse I have to use control v etc. I'm wondering if there's something I need to pass to the reverse proxy to give stuff like next cloud behind the rivers proxy access to the clipboard. If anybody knows anything about this I would greatly appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping my fellow homelab community can weigh in on this. I run a few websites that send email (~1-5k per month) and have a bunch of homelab stuff on different domains that sends transactional emails (~500 per month).
 I have been using Mailgun for the last few years and whilst good, I have started having to pay each month as the amount of emails sent goes over the free tier. This has at most been around $6-$10 in a single month. I have been tying with the thought of switching over to amazon SES as its ridiculously cheaper. I then happened to stumble on the delights of Postal (postalserver.io).
 I am now stuck toying with the idea of SES or do I host my own Postal on a VPS somewhere? I send emails from roughly 20 different domains and would like to utilise security features where possible. I understand the issues with IP reputation that comes from email delivery.
 Am i better off just sticking with SES? Overall it will probably be cheaper. Or do I go Postal with slightly more VPS monthly cost but with the freedom and much better UI / dashboards?
 ​
 OR even better can I host Postal on AWS and get postal to send via SES and utilise the 62k free emails per month (i assume this either wont work or will require each domain to be verified in SES anyway?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. I am very sure that my self-hosted AdGuard Home container is causing problems for me.
 I am currently often playing Modern Warfare 2 in the evening / night and I am playing and the Steam connection is randomly lost. First I thought of the Steam servers of course but I'm the only one with problems. It happens every day or at least every second day. And then the connection is lost and won't reconnect for at least 5 minutes I guess. Then it often works again.
 I tried to change the DNS server in the settings of my ethernet adapter on Windows 11 (to 8.8.8.8 e.g. instead of the local server) where I have my server 192.168.178.xx and as second 1.1.1.1 and flushed the DNS and it instantly worked again. So it seems to be that it has something to do with my DNS by AdGuard Home. But how the hell I am I supposed to really validate it or better fix it?
 The internet stays online while this disconnect in Steam is happening. Everything keeps working. Only Steam is not.
 Does anybody have an idea? I am pretty sure its caused by the DNS...

 I've just tried them back-to-back with some 10g server ports ( for link/ping tests ) and that doesn't seem to function either. Does anyone have these running with copper interface SFP+ modules? Do you have a part number if so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've recently gotten my hands on an HP DL380 G6 that I cannot for the life of me get to post. No matter what I've tried I cannot get any video output, not even as much as seeing the HP splash screen. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 I can't reach iLO by domain name, and does not show up in device list on my router so I cannot find an IP address (server may not even have a valid license).
 Last owner of the server was able to reach the BIOS, and did not make any configuration changes before I got it.
 Front panel indicators:
  
Server health indicator: solid green
 Server power indicator: solid green
 DIMMs: off
 Power supplies: off
 Processors: Solid amber
 Hard drive lights: come on for a split second and turn off almost immediately
 Fans: off
 Over temp: off
 Power cap: off
  
Fixes I've tried are as follows: 
  
Resocketing CPUs, along with running each CPU individually
 Running minimum amount of DIMMs
 Using only 1 power supply
 Resocketing the power supplies
 Swapping the power supplies
 Changing VGA port used 
 Did not try a different cable as I know for a fact the one I was using works
 
 Changing to a different monitor
 Flipping DIP switch 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping it off (turning server off and removing power supplies before flipping it each time obv)
 Flipping DIP switch 1, 5, 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping them off
 Simply letting it sit for an hour or so to see if it was just taking an absurd amount of time to boot
  
If any more information is needed I'll happily provide it, and once again thank you for your help.

I've got a dedicated HP-109a with VMs and about 30 dockers. and I've had an HP microserver N40L running for over 10 years, most of it running on unRAID. It's got about 7 disks in It. Some 4TB, 3TB, 2TB etc.. About 15TB in total. N40L is getting a bit old now.. it for the most part shares out large media files over jellyfin. 
 Was thinking of just getting 1 x 20TB disk in the HP-109a and having that as my NAS and container server & VMs.. it should handle the load OK.. i Can keep the N40L as an offline backup... I can live with loosing a week or so of data without parity. Don't think I need the RAID performance.. any other considerations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've created a dual-boot PC for myself so I can learn how to use Linux and hopefully transition away from Windows. 
 I want to have my PC automatically backup all its data. However, there are a lot of different ways to backup PCs, and I'm not sure which methods/programs would work best for my situation. 
 I've looked through the r/DataHoarder Wiki and I have a rough idea of what a backed-up PC should look like, but my problem is that there are a lot of backup tools and programs out there and I don't know which I should use. "I'm trapped by overchoice." 
 I also can't seem to find any guides on what can and can't be done when trying to backup a dual-boot PC. Can one operating system backup both itself and the other operating system, or do both operating systems need to have their own backups? 
 As to my current situation. I have about 1TB of personal data (I save a lot of movies, music, and images). I currently have all my data saved on a 2TB external USB HDD. My dual-boot PC is set up, but I haven't installed anything on it yet because I want to make sure I have a backup system all set up first. I have a bit of a "hodgepodge" of drives. I have:
  
Two 500GB SSDs as my boot drives for Linux and Windows respectfully
 One 500GB HDD I salvaged from my mom's old desktop.
 One 750GB HDD I salvaged from my old Toshiba laptop
 One 2TB HDD that serves as my PC's internal "bulk storage" drive for all the music, videos, and images. 
 One external USB 2TB HDD that I've been using as my backup drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at Restic, BackupPC and Borg right now and trying to figure out if either of them support pre- and post-commands.
 The reason is that I would like to run a few exporters first, like so:
 ``` sysupgrade -b $outname.tar.gz # Also supports printing to STDOUT, but its always .tar.gz mysqldump ... # To dump all tables, users, ...
 ... others ...
 rsync serve $type wasabi-crypt:/backups ```
 After that, I might want to run cleanup commands.
 I will be running this on: - GNU/Linux, Debian 11 - linux, OpenWrt
 As for my windows maschines, it's quite straight forward: just a directory list and possibly LudoSavi... but thats a worry for another day. First, I need to get my cruicial infrastructure (router, servers) backed up.
 As for the backend: I am using Wasabi with an encryption setup - I want to use it as my off-site backup, purely. Hence rclone mount .... I did see Restic can do that on it's own (making me believe it might just consume the RClone API) but I am not sure if Borg can.
 In the end, I am also not sure if I want to use multiple repositories or not; probably depends on the program.
 Would love if you could give me some input on this! Thanks so much :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a couple dozen drives, all their own volume (virtualized as one via DrivePool) of various sizes and models.
 Following a a power...blip? the other day, StableBit Scanner is reporting a handful of them with unreadable sectors.
 Every single drive where damage was reported is in a single QNAP enclosure.
 Number of sectors unreadable on all affected drives: 1, 1, 1, 8, 61, 44240
 Only two media files were affected (99%+ intact) and were recovered via Scanner. The "most damaged" drive amounted to 21MiB in terms of storage.
 Scanner reports all drives as otherwise healthy, and no SMART flags to check
 I manually confirmed that all affected drives are reporting 0 for Reallocated Sectors, Reallocation Events, Pending Sectors, Uncorrectable Sectors (I guess that last one doesn't make sense to me)
 My two questions are:
 Should I treat this as "the beginning of the end" for these drives, or not?
 Would a UPS have probably avoided this event?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got my storage start on HardForums storage showoff threads in around 2008 and I miss that format quite a lot so I think it's about time we recreate it here. The basic idea is to post pictures of your setup, detail the spec and tell us what you use your storage for.
 Here's an example post format...
  
 Amount of total storage (Raw/Formatted/Config)
 Case
 PSU
 CPU
 RAM
 Motherboard
 Controller Cards (if any)
 Drives (include full model numbers)
 Operating System
 A paragraph or two describing what you use your storage for and how you handle backups and organizing and maybe future upgrade plans.
 Gallery of images (use imgur gallery format not separate image links)
  
 We will run this thread every 6 months or so and update the post to feature the most upvoted, discussed and interesting systems! Have fun!! 
 P.S. Some of you may remember where I was when I first joined DH, from this thread and it's about time I post a new one so I'll join you in posting my current setup should this go well.

Back-end service (the one that has vikunja-unstable-windows-4.0-386.exe in the folder)
 Front-end service such as the desktop client
  
Standard ports are already taken by XAMPP and i haven't configured "config.yml.sample" BUT for the sake of testing I don't have xampp running.
 I tried running it out of the box but the last line of code is:
 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8258504-05:00: INFO ▶ [EVENTS] 093 Starting handler, subscriber_name=namespace.created.namespace.counter.increase, topic=namespace.created 
 Meanwhile it says at the first lines
 2022/12/14 16:38:02 No config file found, using default or config from environment variables. 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8222434-05:00: INFO ▶ migration/Migrate 04e Ran all migrations successfully. 
 I'm pretty sure to configure the yaml file i need to remove .sample but it should work out of the box without configuring it right? Mind you during this test i'm not running any server on localhost.
 I run the client and the prompt says
 An error occurred: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL Please check if the api url is correct. 
 After inserting the default port in the address:
 Could not find or use Vikunja installation at "localhost". Please try a different url. 
 What do i do now?

File permissions have been ridiculously annoying while on linux and I wanted to change to ext4. I have had success in some ways with hfsplus mounting but I can not share the drives or do anything I really want lol.
 Does the Probox work as ext4 or zfs? I did not want to do NTFS but...I would prefer it to HFS+ at this point. 
 If yes to ext4 and/or NTFS: If I format one drive at a time, would that work? Or would I lose/corrupt data on the other 2 drives? I am asking because I was hoping to copy as much data to 2 of the drives, wipe, then transfer data back. Do this for all 3
 Do I manually remove the drive from the enclosure or can I format a drive, one at a (I have no idea how raid really works or if this is actually a raid setup). 
 Thank you guys!

This program looked like an ideal file sync program for me. However, I discovered that one of my favorite YouTubers made a nice tutorial about file syncing using a program known as "Resilio". I don't know which of these two programs to pick, so I was wondering if anyone here has used Resilio and could give a review of the program, and maybe talk about how it compares to other file sync programs.

 Super quiet, upgrades or swapping out for consumer / quiet is fine, but it must be quiet 
 The SuperMicro SQ PSU is not that quiet, I have that also, its still loud, but quieter than a jet turbine hahaa

 Good build quality, I don't want cheap chassis to kill me with slow death of annoyance and failure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I tried posting on r/buildapc and it didn't get any responses. I've moved recently, and I'm on a new build estate which seems to be suffering with brown outs a few times a week. I've been told this will stop next year as the other side of the estate is connected, however it's worrying me a little as my NAS, PC and Mac mini have all been unexpectedly shutdown a few times. I'd like to attach:
  
Synology DS1817+ (5-60W)
 PC (750wPSU) (70-500W)
 Mac Mini (2-80W)
 Network gear (50-100W complete guess as I've not attached the meter yet)
  
I'm not much of a gamer, so the PC is very rarely pulling 500W+, it tends to idle at 70W and normal use may take it to 150W. I've been looking at a few of the calculators and for 3 minutes runtime something rated around the 1500VA/900W seems to be recommended. I've got no experience with UPSs at home, we use Eaton at work, but I've never had much to do with their configs. I think I can budget around £300, but I could stretch that a little. I've got some rack gear, so I'm open to either rack or freestanding units. These models seem to come up, or their rack equivalent:
  
CyberPower CP1500EPFCLCD
 Powercool Smart UPS 2000VA
 APC BX1600MI
 Eaton 5P850i
  
I'd be grateful for any feedback, recommendations and I can provide any other info if it helps. I'm slightly confused by the price differences for similar headline specs, I'm not sure if this is just a brand thing or some feature I should be focussing on. Any recommendation for the software setup, mainly for the Mac and NAS as they are always on. 
 Thanks in advance :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a while and I'm a bit confused. As many others, my lab is composed of (close to) free stuff I gathered for years, I'd rather make things work with what I have.
 I recently upgraded my simple network (fritzbox + fritzrepeater, main network + guest access) to a more complex setup: fritzbox (as a vdsl modem), apu4c board running opnsense, Netgear GS324T managed switch, fritz repeater as an AP.
 As you can see, the fritzbox and the repeater are now far apart thus the mesh feature stopped working and with it the guest access, that's to be expected. What I don't understand is the following: for the guest access to work between the fritzbox and the repeater, there has to be some vlan shenningans, I doubt AVM invented a brand new mechanism to separate traffic. My guess was that somehow all fritzbox ports were trunked with the default vlan being for the main network and all traffic from guest access was tagged with a vlan id.
 I tried setting it up like that, but I couldn't identify the vlan id (tried a bunch but that's tedious and I'm unsure how to inspect traffic at the switch, never done port mirroring before, not sure how to use linux to listen to it).
 Anyway, my question is, does anyone know if AVM could be using some other technology? Is there another way to use a fritz repeater to have two separate networks?

 + Name of Movie (YEAR) - Name of Movie (YEAR).mp4 - Name of Movie (YEAR)-poster.jpg 
 https://kodi.wiki/view/Movie_artwork#Local_Artwork
 I'm wondering what "poster" is. Is it the front cover of the DVD case? like this https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/e8EAAMXQAx9RN3Lq/s-l500.jpg ? I'm asking because Kodi doesn't use "cover.jpg."
 Also do you prefer the naming scheme above or you just use "cover.jpg", like so:
 + Name of Movie (YEAR) - Name of Movie (YEAR).mp4 - cover.jpg

 What's the best drive I can find regarding power consumption + silent and preferably 5400 RPM for 12TB+?

Wanted something small that could be tucked away in a corner but have enough to run the few VM's I use and came across this (MINIS FORUM U820). Not supper powerful, but out of the box, this thing is quick. I kept the 512 M.2 drive it came with for holding ISO's and so on and added in 2 1TB SSD's and upgraded the RAM to 32GB. The only issue I have so far is vanilla ESXi 7 will not see either NIC, but vanilla ESXi 8 will see the 2.5GB port (which is what I needed). I am sure if I played around with it, I could get the 1GB port working. Just thought I would pass this along for anyone looking at something small.

 What do you do? Generic host names? Numbering? Software names? Anything creative? Do you follow a theme like greek letters/zodiacs/whatever?
 router dot domain is not that creative, neither is media dot domain. I saw someone using planets or stars but I guess that could become messy and not that obvious when debugging stuff not touched for a long time

 I'm living in europe and I've noticed that electricity prices in my area (Germany) have been exponentially increasing, thanks to Putin... (0,23€/kWh to 0,44€/kWh)
 I'm looking for ways to reduce my energy consumption and cut down on costs, and I'm wondering what measures other European homelabbers have taken to combat rising electricity prices.
 Currently i setup my Fujitsu Primergy RX600 S6 to only run from 9AM to 1AM so i can at lease save a third of the costs, by running it 16 hours a day im actually awake instead of 24/7. Also i configured power savings mode in iRMC. It is still running at 170 Watts.
 Any further advice, hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to fix the "status" indicator for non -arr apps added to Homarr?
 I don't use -arr services right now, but I like Homarr as my dashboard. Unfortunately, the little "online" indicators all show as offline, except for Dash. (dashdot). I know the services are online, but not sure how to fix this.
 I can remove these indicators by toggling the option within the advanced options tab, but it'd be nice to have a quick visual status indicator.
 Any ideas?
 First picture shows NPM as offline, but pings show otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone built a homelab storage solution that achieves: 
  
large sized volumes, say 30TB or larger (so simply using expensive SSD arrays isn’t an option)
 high IOPS, say 5-10k (so a simple mechanical array isn’t an option)
 utilizing 2.5GbE network capacity 
  
Or, if you wanted to build a NAS solution with about 30TB of working data, with lots of small I/O, and fully utilizing a 2.5GbE network, what would you build?
 Synology SSD read-write cache is insufficient, Intel CAS is commercial and is designed for Optane primarily I think, Intel SRT is discontinued, storage spaces with an SSD tier might be an option but they really want you to use an expensive Windows Server install and spaces seems to be unwieldy, Linux bcache might be an option, ZFS or Unraid with an SSD cache might be an option…

The 730xd has more drive space than I know what to do with, no optical bay, but has those fancy rear flex bays.
 I'm wondering if I can take a r730xd and swap the front section for the 8x3.5" from the r730. This way I can have my OS mirror, optical drive, and not feel bad for using 1/3 of the drive space. I don't see anything online about it though, and wanted to check here before I sacrifice my dvd drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, long time, first time.
 I built a new NAS a couple of months ago with a i3-10100 CPU @ 3.60GHz (Gigabyte B560M) and a number of WD Red HDDs based on TrueNAS Scale. It's fast and quiet, and really does everything that I could need it for.
 However, I also have a Synology DS920+ on the way from a friend who got a newer 923 from his work. He's only had the 920 for about 6 months. Knowing what I know about Syno, it'll also do the trick.
 My question is this: which one will last longer? Which is a better value proposition for things like Plex, the 'arr suite, and simple Time Machine/cold storage?
 I'm a little worried that what is essentially a gaming motherboard is going to wear out at a certain point, but I'm calling on all of your years experience: go with the DIY solution for the long run, or trust in the Syno, which I've seen people running for 8 years or so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I purchased a SFP module from FS - GPON-ONU-34-20BI. And after ~1h port management and many other functions on UDM SE just stop working. Restart solves it but restarting a router every hour is extremely stupid. Ubiquiti support literally said to me that they don’t care because it isn’t their module. But the problem is that I can’t use theirs module because I need to change GPON SN and VendorID to get internet connection from my ISP. Do you have any SFP modules with changeable SN and VendorID to recommend? Of course it needs to work with UDM SE.
 TLDR: recommend any module that meets requirements in the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked this in /r/webdev and they suggested you folks could help me more:
 I have a niche website that currently has about a dozen TB of storage. As the website has started to grow, the data has started to become an issue....the hard drive I use to hold the files is no longer going to be able to hold it all. I'm estimating the storage will be 25-50TB, with about 50-100GB in daily bandwidth, at a minimum. So I need solutions with unlimited traffic.
 I am cheap, so using cloud providers like Azure, AWS is not really an option. I have noticed that Hetzner has cheap servers, with large hard drives (and empty slots for future growth). The issue I now see is the practical question of...how do I merge the hard drives while maintaining some level of protection against disk failure? If I have 3 HD…]]></summary>

 I don't have a ZFS server, but plan to build a modest one sometime in the future - so should I grab some Optane modules now before they are gone for good?
 Background: Optane solid state memory is great for write caching because unlike standard SSD storage it really won't wear out in any reasonable amount of time.

 So bit the bullet and today got a ZTE MC8020 5G CPE Router. It's arguably the best 5G router on the market (before ZTEs 6Ghz one drops in a few weeks). Without any tweaking I can get 300/50mbps solid with pings as low as 8ms. On my home fiber I was never offered anything better than 50/5mbps for the same price...
  
My question is how to I properly set up both the devices so they work together?
 I have every ethernet port of the AX88U populated. TV, PS5, 2x Gig Homelab, NV Shield, PC, etc. Previously I just connected the WAN port on the AX88U into the wall ethernet socket.

 Every now and again (4 times today) the internet will drop completely and will stay down until I reboot the ISP router. 
 I know it’s the ISP router as I plug an Ethernet cable directly into it, and there’s no internet. 
 Frustratingly, this seems to be happening more and more frequently, and the ISP can’t send an engineer until next week, so I’m looking to see if there’s anything anybody can suggest. 
 What’s even more odd is when I’m experiencing the issue the IP I get when plugging into the ISP router is not my WAN IP. When the issue isn’t happening, it is. 
 So the issue seems to be down to the ISP router doing something weird/wrong. 
 It’s driving me fucking crazy and I can’t handle another week before the engineer comes. The last three times I’ve rebooted, the connection has lasted for about 10-20 minutes and then it goes down again. Same issue as I’ve described above. 
 Anybody have any fucking idea?!

 As I am now using gimme-iphoto for regularly downloading all of my photos, I found that there's certain metadata missing from certain files... What I found missing:
  
Any geolocation data - missing from any photo or video
 Date taken - missing from any screenshot or imported picture
  
I have also tried using a Mac and exporting the photos (by hand), but this information is also missing, whereas if I look at the photos' info boxes, even screenshots have dates attached to them.
 Is there any solution to download / export the files with this missing data?

 ​
 I've been testing some stuff with the new 10gb network, and I seem to have hit a strange issue. On Windows 10, running iperf to a TrueNAS box with 2 10Gb ports bondeed together, I am getting 6Gb/s on a single thread, which I don't think is too bad.
 ​
 But when I run multiple tests over time, it eventually drops to 2.4 ish....I thought maybe the NIC was overheating, but I ziptied a fan to it and it still seems to be having trouble. The drivers for this card were absolute dogshit to setup, and I'm to the point I"m probably going to grab an intel 10gb nic instead....
 ​
 Does anyone else have experience with 10gb that could tell me maybe why I'm getting this weirdly sudden and consistent drop in speed? I'm using an HPNC523SFP on both sides of the connection, with a Mikrotik CRS317 running SWOS in the middle here. The NAS Server is running Proxmox with the 2 ports bonded in lacp mode passed to a bridge that a TrueNAS VM is using. The ports are set both in active mode on the switch, and the client is just a plain ass Windows 10 box.
 ​
 I can't think of anything else significant I have configured here...

(This is a FQDN.) I have seen the docs and followed the various tips including adjusting APP_URL, APP_ENV and APP_FORCE_URL. Whenever I switch APP_URL to https, the site becomes inaccessible with an SSL error.
 Here are the configs: https://pastebin.com/Qccwu1LN
 As an aside, I poked around the Apache configs in the Docker container and was curious to see that there is no SSL conf in sites-enabled. There is a config in sites-available, but I think that the path to the SSL certs is wrong. Could this be causing the issue?
 It feels like, "it just works" for most people here, but for whatever reason, I have had nothing but problems configuring SSL. (HTTP works fine.)

 Mount each raspberry pi onto eachother via an rclone sftp mount.
 on each raspi settup jellyfin to read from the remote raspi drives and their own local drive.
 Now each raspberry pi is connected to eachother and each person with a raspberry pi can play media from it.
 But now let’s say I would want to add a 4th raspi remotely. Since each person lives separately what would be a good way to make it to auto-connect a 4th raspi?

 I found recently the Flame dashboard and really liked the look. I had no experience in customizing such things, but found out how to do it myself and am happy to share. Hopefully it will be helpful for someone out there! :)
 I know it's not a big deal, however, I am still happy about this achievement.

 I plan to keep and host all family videos / photos on my server, and have backups on and off site of that server. 
 Planning on using something like syncthing to get pics from our phones to the pixel, and then from the pixel to our "family" google account.
 Questions:
  
What is the best way to get pictures from our phones (android and iphone) to my server? Syncthing? Some other app im not thinking of?
 
Is it really unlimited full res for the life of the phone? I used the "reduced quality" for a long time and was never disappointed with the quality of the pictures saved - should I just use that to not piss google off?
 
Any other tips to get this to work flawlessly? (auto delete from phone after it uploads to google, etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got one of those BF deals for a big external HDD. Inside the outer Amazon box was the inner manufacturer box, but that was actually loose inside of the outer box. HDD itself seemed well packed / protected inside of the Manufacturer box though. 
 I documented the way it arrived and ran the an extended SMART driver test using the Manufacturer's utility. Took a couple of days due to size of the drive, but passed with no issues. Ran a few short tests with the same results. 
 So my question for my fellow Datahorders is what would you do? Return the drive and hope replacement is packed better or be satisfied with inner box protection + testing? Just curious.

 I tried going to the dashboard and doing Quick Sync, but it uses ./galleries/ which I can't find on my piwigo instance using the shell and when I try to add /gallery as a site it says the directory doesn't exist.
 If there's any other better way to sync my gallery with piwigo I would love to hear it, I'm using Android.
 I did try to use photoprism and lychee too but they didn't play well with syncthing and I didn't find any free ways to sync my gallery with either of them
 ​
 This is my docker compose for both syncthing and piwigo
 Edit: I checked with the entire file system and just had to route the shared folder of syncthing and piwigo to /gallery/galleries in the piwigo instance

 I have a music library that measures 59.7gb on my windows 10 laptop SSD. When I have transferred my library to my android phone it suddenly measures 63.97gb (when viewed via the phone's file explorer) and 59.8gb (when the phone is connected by usb and viewed via windows file explorer).
 ​
 Is this normal? Is it just due to differences in the filesystem or formatting or something? I tried searching around a little but I'm struggling to find a solid answer on this and would appreciate some assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all.
 ​
 I have a NAS in a SilverStone DS380 (8-hotswap bay) along with some external USB 3.0 disk enclosures, making a total of 12x10TB but the pool is starting to get full and I am thinking of adding 4x20TB in short-term (Q1 2023) getting to 12x20TB in the mid-term (Q4 2024).
 ​
 SilverStone DS380 8-bay
 I do not have space for jumping to a rack solution (which is always on my mind and I will do for sure once i move home) so I need to stick in the meantime with tower-based NAS/DAS solutions. The ideal case would be the 12-bay Synology model of the pic, with the possibility to daisy-chain another 12-bay model to it, but I cannot ID it or find a non-rack alternative.
 ​
 ​
 Synology DS 12-bay
 ​
 Basically, I am trying to find a tower-size 8-bay (minimum) to 12-bay (preferable) DAS (no need to be hot-swap) with USB connection to attach it to my DS380 NAS until I move to a real rack solution (early 2025). 
 ​
 I have found some solutions from Orico, Mediasonic, Fantec, OWC, Sabrent... but I read a lot of connectionand cooling issues from this solutions I need to avoid as my system is on 24/7 as a backup and media server to 4 users. Plus I find them too overpriced for just a steel case with trayless bays ($50?), 150w low-efficiency PSU ($30?) and a bunch of SATA to USB adapters ($15?).
 ​
 ​
 Mediasonic 8-bay
 ​
 The best option I manage is another DS380 as a JBOD DAS, with a 300W gold SFX PSU, a pair of SSF-8088 connectors and SFF-8087 cables, but I would need to adress the dual-PSU synchronism with a Supermicro JBOD power control board for example and I would need to buy a JBOD card on my main system with external SSF-8088 connectors.
 ​
 Any thoughts on this? I live in Europe so the available solutions may be reduced.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Reddit! (Sorry for my english)
 I'm looking for a simple self-hosted Forms Builder with a really important feature. It should have an option to prefill some fields using attributes from URL
 I have an example - https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 So if i'll use link http://myip:5200/form/gdR6dx?field1=text1 I'll get prefilled field "field1" with "text1"
 I guess you've got the idea. But this APP is buggy and is not really supported how I can see. So I'm looking for another one with same feature
 Also https://forms.yandex.com/ provide the same feature, but it's not a self-hosted app
 https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/forms/pre-fill
 I checked a few posts with same topic but didn't find exactly what I'm looking for
 Apps which I already tried:
 https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 https://github.com/Budibase
 https://github.com/formio/formio
 Thanks for your help!

 I'm working on a open source self-hosted dashboard that has the following core functionalities: hardware monitoring and file storage/management. My goal is to make it as minimalistic and user friendly as possible. The current name I have in mind is X-Panel. I'm looking for suggestions for a good name and some more features for this web app. I want a name that is easy to remember and accurately reflects the functionality of the web app. Any suggestions or ideas for improving the current name or coming up with a new one would be greatly appreciated! I have also added some screenshots of the web interface.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

Seafile seems ideal, but heard some critique regarding the way files are stored and issues that could happen if something happens to the database. 
 We all use Apple devices, so syncthing is not so good either as their iOS app is really awful. 
 Nextcloud feels very sluggish and OwnCloud Infinite Scale is very young with not lots of documentation (not even sure it has server side encryption).
 Any recommendations on that matter? Thanks!

 As you know Google will start to delete files on in-active accounts starting from January 2023. I was wondering if there is a tool that can login to the account and do some activity so the 2 year policy resets? A simple one to ping the google services like gdrive gmail or other g services so that the inactivity timer resets?
 https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/10214036#activity 
 A plugin or a tool that can create and delete a folder on gdrive every 30 days and keeps a track record for example will do the magic I think.
 Thank you

 The story starts in 2016 when I bought my first RAID controller and drives to build my first storage server. Being of young age and with limited means, I opted to cheap out on the controller and buy the (as I later figured out) awful HighPoint Rocketraid 840A, then going for about $300. Compared with an LSI card with 16 ports, that was approximately a third of the price when buying new (Stupid me didn't even consider buying used). Of course, it later turns out that the hardware RAID6 capabilities I bought the card for are not even present, but that is another story for another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 on recommandation of : u/halbzu
 I will post my question here.
 Hello niece and nephews, its testlab01 with a new question and advise needed.
 I want to buy as in the TS says an NAS. a 4bay nas to have it in RAID-5 for fail over. The reason for this is because we are running out of cloud storage on my device as my families devices. Google etc, and when i want to expand the cloud storage i need to pay a lot for something what is not mines. And if i dont pay anymore i still need to store all the files to something local. So in this case an NAS would be the best solution.
 So i know only two brands Synology the number(1) famous NAS brand, and QNAP what is more for professionals i think. My preference self goes to Synology because the software DSM.
 But i am still not really convinced which one to buy. In my shopping cart (eBay) i have added DS920+ and 4x 2tb IronWolf ST4000VN006 in total i will have 12TB of storage with fail over of 1 disk of 4tb.
 In the meantime 923+ came out in November 2022 and is a upgrade compared to the ds920+Pro"s- 2.5gbps Ethernet port.- upgrade to 16gb ram, not official only upgrade to 8gb with an extra so-dimm 4GB.- new CPU AMD this time (but no GPU processing power, so PLEX will not be the great solution)- now you can have nvme storage pools.
 I am not a big watcher because of work (not that much time) but it would be always good when i have time to watch something without problems.
 My budget is about 800€ less is always better, i have a voucher of 300€ discount so from 966€ will be like 699€ what a good price is for NAS + storage 16GB.
 still to take the 923+ that one is more expensive as well. But getting longer updates as well, or to stay with the 920+ + or even a QNAP to take?
 building a NAS etc, will not be the choice because it will never give you all the bells an whisels what you get with an NAS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a 2 bedroom flat. No basements, or other suitable places for a server cabinet. I also can't run ethernet cables without drilling lots of holes everywhere. The ISP's coax cable enters the flat on the corner of the living room so all the wired stuff has to live within immediate vicinity of it. 
 That means I have to be very careful picking equipment - everything has to be quiet and not very hideous. Enter, my homelab:
 Not too ugly, no?
 The loudest piece here is the big NAS. Everything else is completely silent. The NAS has 12 hard disks generating a noticeable, persistent buzzing sound. Thankfully, it's only audible if the room is entirely silent. If there is anything on the TV I can't hear it at all.
 On the wireless side, most devices are on the TP-Link AP. It supports VLANs and has decent coverage. The Netgear AP only exists to deliver as fast a connection as possible to my desktop PC on the other side of the flat. More on that here.
 Overall, this is what the network map looks like:

 I plan on adding 5G cellular backup at some point, but overall I'm pretty happy with this setup!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR;
 I'm torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability/recoverability. Hence I am looking for some (long-term) experiences from people who have tried or are using SeaweedFS.
 Full story;
 I have been following SeaweedFS for quite some time and I loved it initially, however, as time progresses and I learned more about it I got a bit worried about its recoverability.
 I tested it locally and had some issues with it, but those were mainly due to my own lack of knowledge with regards to SeaweedFS and Linux. My failures are what made me initially doubt the recoverability potential of the software since I did have data-loss during my tests. Luckily it was only test-data.
 When you initially start reading about SeaweedFS it sounds really easy to set up and get started with, and it is, but there are so many things to be aware of when using it "in production" that are not always clear in the beginning. For example: The Filer *IS* a single point of failure if you don't back it up (even though the GitHub page states that there is no single point of failure). Or that it's best to use config files instead of cli parameters when running in production.
 On the other hand, if you know you need to keep these things in mind, then it doesn't really form an issue.
 I'm really torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability and recoverability, and I'm looking for some experiences from people that have tried it are using SeaweedFS, especially long-term use.

 Lemme list a couple of things I "discovered" by myself:
 - miniflux - the best self-hosted rss ever. fast (due to spartan UI), yet extensible via customized CSS and tons of extensions. Integrates nicely with Mac's Reeder and Reeder app on iOS (which is an essence of brilliant UX/UI for me).
 - kanboard - extremely simple kanban board, still so powerful and elegant. An essence of extreme usefulness combined with almost no UI.
 - flame - a simple dashboard. Hell, I wish I found it before - it would save me a lot of time setting up my family's bookmarks. Being able to see different set of bookmarks depending on whether you're "signed-in" or not was the game changer for me.
 - metube - best tool to fetch YouTube music to feed your AzuraCast home radio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short I have been trying to put together documentation together or more so a large list of items related to my self hosting setup, important personal information(not particular to self hosting) and resources for the items. This was originally brought up by my brother since my family more or less relies on alot of my self hosted items and would not know what to do if I "got hit by a bus". I'm calling this my doomsday drive, as I'm hoping to store this in a safe at my parents home and potentially safe within my home.
 ​
 I'm curious if anyone has any templates out there or has any ideas for this. My documentation has by no means been good and I'm trying to get better and by adding items into my notion.so account (not self hosted, may get smite'd for this).
 ​
 Edit:
 Taking all the feedback I received this is the plan I'm going with:
  
Moving from LastPass over to Bitwarden (this has been on my mind for awhile but this gave me the momentum to go through with it).
 Using https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr provided from u/felipefideli as a template for accounts and just general personal info that will be stored within Bitwarden.
 Continuing documentation and building a static website for the documentation with instructions of how to spin up the container as well as a copy of it so it can be ran on a rasp pi which will be stored in my parents safe. Will also be writing these in text(markdown) files as well, will be encrypted as well.
 Recovery codes are going to be stored within bitwarden as well as physical copies stored at my bank and at my parents safe, this is only in case something were to happen to my phone as my fiancé knows how to access it. 
 Currently in the process of learning Ansible and setting up AWX so if something fails in the short term (like NVR) I will have templates to easily fix it.
 Continuing teaching my brother my environment.

It has 4x M520 blades which have nice specs, but admittedly are a bit older on LGA1356 with DDR3 and I'm looking to replace the blades. I started looking into Dell's technical guidance and found where it lists M520, 620, 630, 640, 820, 830 blades as options. I found some options on ebay which are listed as PowerEdge M630 through their service tags. Looking at my blades service tags they are reported as: PowerEdge M520 (for PE VRTX). 
 I don't know a lot about these VRTX Chassis other than they have some special connectivity and PCIe sharing options. That being said, is there a difference between a normal M630 blade (say from a m1000E chassis) and the M520 from the VRTX?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Planning on making my first homelab and need some advise.
 Got an Fujitsu FUTRO S920 as router due to this video. Got an NAS which will get RTL8125B nic in either 2.5 or 10 gb. But don't know what NIC to get for my router without breaking the bank, and ofc a good switch behind the router to plug all the devices in. My pc asus mobo already got 2.5 but could a RTL8125B nic in there aswell if needed. 
 ISP currently delivers 500mbit download so could I cheap out and use 1gb ethernet port on the thinclient? Single nic's are much cheaper and easier to find than double. 
 BTW: I'm thinking of running OpenWrt on the thinclouter/router.
 Would appreciate some suggestion and or tips :)

 I know there is a firewall feature on some Supermicro servers but tech support answer was it doesn't work because no one is using it.
 Having it exposed to net is a no go. But if I go with some VPN device I will need to pay for another U.

 I see that docker allows you to set the ip for docker's internal networks, but is it possible to be done this way? It is similar to Virtualbox/vmware bridged connection compared to NAT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Dell PowerEdge T330 that I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy) on, and of course Dell in their standard lack of consideration for Linux users by dragging their feet on updating the ISM software to support current versions, so I decided to research and figure out how to get it installed onto the system myself. Versions given in example are current as of when I did the installation. 
 And now, on to the instructions!
  
Download & install libssl1.1:
  
​
 cd ~ && wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb wget https://dl.dell.com/FOLDER08657945M/1/OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00.tar.gz tar -xvzf OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00.tar.gz --one-top-level 
  
Edit the Installation Script:
  
​
 nano ./OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00/setup.sh 
  
Change setup.sh line 294 from 20 to 22, and save file:
  
​
 if [ "$OS" == "Ubuntu" ] && [ "$VER" == "22" ]; then 
  
Finally, run the setup script, I went ahead and selected 10 (install everything):
  
​
 sudo bash setup.sh

 **Please note, this requires you to install libssl1.1, which has been depreciated on 22.04 and you must download it from a previous version repository.

 What I basically want to do is to setup a Kubernetes Cluster able to manage some services I want to publish online.
 Virtualisation would be preferred because I don't want to setup 3+ Machines to run K3S on it when I can do it on only one physical machine (well my wife probably would kill me if I but 3 more machines)
 If you go for a complete Server Build: what would you recommend? (I will probably Build it from scratch since I don't have the money to buy it at once)
 If it's a consumer build? What CPU and Mainboard do you recommend? (Power Consumption should not be high!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I generally lurk and rarely posts here.
 ​
 I saw the Western Digital sale post during Black Friday for the Red Pro NAS drives so I jumped on the chance. Bought 2, and then realized I needed more so bought 2 more. The first 2 drives came perfectly fine, passed SMART and had no problems with stress tests. 
 The second batch had huge problems. One, they delivered only ONE drive instead of the two I ordered. Next, the one drive that did arrive was dead on arrival. SMART wasn't even working when I plugged it in. So I tried RMAing it, but that requires registering it. So I tried registering the drive and lo and behold, I get
 "Sorry! Product registration failed, please try later. (STATCODE108)" 
 Customer support is just running me around the ringer. They keep promising me updates with no updates given after their promised deadline of "24-48 hours." I have gone through both their chat system, garnering me the generic
 ("Please allow me to inform you that your issue has already been forwarde to our team and they are looking iinto the issue.")
 and calls - what else can I do? 
 I registered the previous 2 drives just fine. All drives were bought directly from the WD online store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have a home server where I run all of these lovely services we like to use in this community. This server happens to be pretty near my TV. And even though I do access some of these over the network I always thought that it would be nice to have some graphic interface on the server and access it just by plugin a HDMI to the TV. I'm with a shameless Ubuntu server 20.04 without X nor any windows server and all of the services with Podman.
 I'd like to keep my host clean, so the idea would be to run either a full os with vagrant or something similar or just run a container with the X server installed and some devices mounted. I don't necessarily want to run a whole wm nor anything similar, I guess I will mostly use it to run regular desktop apps or even just a browser.
 Does it makes sense ? Is any of you doing anything similar ?

 So is there any way (that I'm missing) to set Asus 4G-AC68U to bridge mode, so RT-AC68U router sees internet and acts as sole router?

 Bonus question:
 Having OpenVPN server on router, and connecting from mobile (not in home WLAN) to router via VPN to access LAN from outside, how safe is it taken account that the phone isnt' lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time posting, looking for advice on a first serious server build project. I currently run a media server out of an old windows tower but it's just a full desktop that runs the media server on the side. I want to have a true server that does dedicated tasks. In this case run a Plex server and VM sandbox for professional development.
 I picked up an z820 for a deal and initially was looking to upgrade it to work as a media/sandbox learning server but I'm wondering if it's the best long term option.
 These are the stats of the hardware it came with and what I (pie in the sky) imaged to build it to:
 Hardware as I bought:
  
 CPU Intel Xeon E5-2630 V2 ST1AM 2.60Ghz MALAY J527C615 
  
 RAM 8 x 8GB PC3-14900R DDR3-1866MHz ECC REDG 240-Pin DIMM, 4 x 4GB PC3-14900R DDR3-1866MHz ECC REDG 240-Pin DIMM 
  Disk Space 2 x 120 GB SSD 
  Motherboard HP Dual LGA2011 16 RAM memory slots, SAS & SATA connections REV: 1.03 
  Graphics Card NVIDIA Quadro K600 1GB DDR3 
  PCIe Cards included NVIDIA TESLA K40, Siemens PETLink Stream Buffer Model: 10251412 
 
 ​
 Ideal Build:
  
 CPU Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 x2 
  
 RAM 128GB DDR3 RECC 
  Disk Space 8 x 8TB SAS drive (RAID 10 to maximize performance and fail tolerance) 
  Graphics Card Nvidia GeForce 2080ti 
 
 -Ability to extend storage to a JBOD enclosure
 With all that said. I'm wondering if, for the sake of a long term build, I should just sell it for parts and look for an r720/r720xd to fill it in with less overall footprint? Or is there a better option to consider?

 i currently have a DELL T7910 with
  
Dual Xeon 2640v4 (10c 20t)
 128Gb ram
 Nvidia M2000
 4x 512GB Nvme's in a Dell Ultra-Speed Drive Quad NVMe M.2 PCIe card
 2x 3TB Ironwolfs
 2x 6TB WD Reds
  
as my home server / Lab.
 I am thinking about selling it and change for something that consumes a bit less power then this setup, currently is consuming about 160w idle.
 I was thinking in changing it for a couple of DELL Optiplex 3060 with i5-8500T 32GB ram, both of them would run proxmox, with 4/5 VM's on them.
 One would be more dedicated to media the other more for learning. the VM's that i would run are some linux server, with docker containers and a windows server acting as a Domain controler.
 Do you guys think that it would be a good change or not?
 Thanks in advance.

 My idea was to run my current linux.iso server with the NAS mounted in NFS4.1 and just smack all the sweet linux iso's right onto there.
 Quickly realized I'm getting bottlenecked bigtime, despite running the newest storage tech in RAID 0 for double the speed etc (I kid, don't hurt me). I know Raid0 is stupid but I'll take any performance wins as this will only host data I don't care about losing - not much of a data hoarder, eh.
 Anyways I'm getting cache overloaded to infinity and beyond.

Currently, we use RealVNC but I have been thinking about replacing that with Tailscale and Apache Guacamole. I like the idea of a clientless solution for remote access.
 In terms of the Guacamole server, I was wondering if it would work to use a small Google Compute instance, install tailscale and the guacamole server on that, and then install tailscale on the various workstations and connect them all up. The users would login to the Guacamole server running on the google compute platform and then from there access their machines. 
 If this works, then since this instance of Guacamole would be public facing, I would enable the 2FA plugin. Any other security recommendations? Reverse proxy?
 Any thoughts, suggestions, concerns are welcome. Thanks in advance.

 I'm just starting to become a datahoarder and picked up a Synology NAS. My main motivation was the huge collection of tutorials and other knowledge I've saved on YouTube that may up and disappear one day.
 First Goal: I'm looking for really simple no-code (or very low code - I code all day long, and don't want to have to write/maintain a bunch of this stuff too) way to automatically archive anything I add to a specific YouTube playlist to my Synology NAS. I'd ideally like it to save thumbnails and descriptions as well.
 Second Goal: Some sort of easy interface for browsing, searching, and watching those archived videos, so I'm not just using crummy Windows search to try and find a video in the future.
 Does anyone have suggestions that can address 1 or 2, or both?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have multiple enterprise-grade rack mount servers with SAS RAID controllers (such as PERC H710, and P440). I'm just adding this to emphasize that I already have the hardware, and all controllers have a decent sized BBU-backed cache.
 The vast majority of the data is stored on Kingston DC series SSDs.
 Recently, I have heard multiple opinions saying that using hardware RAID with non-SAS drives has no benefits.
 Reasons in a nutshell:
  
SAS drives have(/had?) 520 byte sectors, so that they can store an 8-byte checksum alongside the 512-byte sector, with SSD drives lacking that, the controller doesn't have a reliable way to detect issues
 most controllers don't use SMART data to predict SSD failure
 it's more difficult to monitor drive failures if the controller hides the physical drives from the OS)
 moderately modern CPUs have no difficulty calculating parity, even at high IO load, and high speeds
  
What do you think? Are there any benefits to using a hard RAID as opposed to switching the controller to HBA mode and configuring soft RAID provided by the OS (be it MD/LVM in Linux, or Windows with the classic, drive-level RAID or Storage Spaces)?

 I did read different opinions... Someone say to store it powered off in an antistatic bag and wrapped in pluriball. Others instead say that having it powered off corrupt faster the data and also the lubricant on the moving parts dries out so that when you power it on again it will put the drive under extreme friction.
 I have not enough knowledge about this to take a decision on my own so I'm here asking for help. 
 Also any other advice will be welcome (such as what to choose when formatting it or anything else that I might not know)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker first time posting. Also English is not my first Language so please bear with me. I currently have Synology NAS with 2 bays with 2 4TB hard drives. I want to expand because I'm quickly approaching 7TB. I have my previous desktop computer that has about 8 drive bays that I would like to expand over time. I would like to get some opinions from the experts before I begin throwing time and money at this project.
 What OS/software should I use to manage/initialize my NAS? -- so far I have heard of TrueNAS, FreeNAS, ZFS and Unraid. Note:not even sure if I know what i am talking about here or if there are differences i am not aware of.
 Is expanding my "pools" for future additional drives going to be an issue? I don't want to be moving around several TB.
 I also read that my drives would have to be matching in size or I won't be able to use the drive to their fullest extent. I was thinking about going to 12-14 TB drives right away but maybe I should by smaller capacity drives to start out? It just seems that in the future my lower capacity drives with hold me back.
 Thoughts about backups - just looking for some suggestions? I read about snapshots but I'm not sure that applies here. I am familiar with the 3-2-1 rule but with the TB amounts of data I have I can't reasonably buy duplicates of all drives just to have 1 to 1 backups (if that makes sense) but maybe there is no way around this.
 I started off my journey with my synology NAS just to see if it would work and now that I have become a little more serious about my data-hoarding I would like a better setup with more storage as well as implement best practices. I see this as the next logical step before I get something that is rack mounted. Let me know all of your thoughts as I am sure I have missed something or have not thought a position through. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 As I frequently see interesting threads on Reddit, and I want to get them offline to 1) find them again easily, and 2) preserve them in case messages get removed, I made myself some time ago a Python script to "download" threads off Reddit.This script does not only download the thread, but generates a nice HTML file, so it can be opened in a browser and the thread navigated around conveniently. Here is an example of such HTML file.
 Recently, I told myself it would be better to have a web frontend for that tooling, since I am sometimes on the go and do not have the script and/or the Python interpreter on my machine.
 This therefore led to RedditArchive, a Flask self-hosted app to archive and download Reddit threads (screenshots available in the README):https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver
 You can install it on a small server of yours, such as a Raspberry Pi or a VPS. Installations instructions are provided if you want to try it on.
 If you do not want to deal with the hassle of setting a web server up, worry not! I also made the original script available here:https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver-standalone
 Do not hesitate to comment and make suggestions – I have ideas for further features, but that's probably for another time. 🦉

 For background, I am quite new to this. I am a photographer and have been using simple external hard drives to edit and view my photos from. A few months ago, I purchased a 10TB WD Elements desktop hard drive, and the pursuit of having faster read/write speeds (without using SSDs) and joining this subreddit has only heightened that "passion" (or addiction?).
 I recently acquired 2x WD Gold 12TB and I have them in the OWC Gemini Dual Thunderbolt 3 enclosure. I have a large amount of photos in which I'd like to use the two drives to store and edit from (I have the appropriate backup system just in case). I would have never thought to go the Raid 0 route but this subred…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using feedme on Android to follow and download a couple of feeds. It 'just' uses Feedly (free). 
 As I have a server running, I was wondering what advantage freshrss or others could have, but it was surprisingly hard to find comparisons. Maybe completely overlooked? Is there some features that I'm not seeing yet?
 I could think of privacy and unlimited number of feeds / articles. What else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I'm late to the game, but I just tried this couple of tools and I really love them. 
 PiHole is super convenient to:
 - prevent _some_ advertisement on websites
 - it can also offer an interface in front of DNSMasq
 - and can also work as DHCP server.
 If you use the DHCP feature, you can associate each DNS request to an hostiname, in case you're curious to know which website you're wife is browsing ;) 
 I wanted to use the raspberry as VPN server and I tried WireguardEasy, it's a nice project but could not make PiHole to answer to the DNS requests coming from Wireguard running as docker. 
 Then I tried PiVpn, the installation took just few seconds and automatically recognize I had PiHole installed, configuring it to listed on the VPN interface. 
 Overall took me a few hours to find the right tool, but if you read this post you can just install PiHole and PiVPN in just a minute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm at the beginning of my homelab journey. I have Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and I have started with some docker containers there. I would like to make step forward and begin with virtualization (experiment with pfsense, networking, guacamole, AD, docker, maybe build small NAS). We rent small flat with my girlfriend and we don't have enough place for rack mounted server or even tower server (She said that 😅). I have an idea to buy PC and use it as first server, and I look for advice.
 My requirements:
 - small and silent,
 - not expensive in reference to power consumption,
 - able to run about 3-5 virtual machines simultaneously and some docker containers,
 - allow to build NAS with that. 
 Options which I found, all of them fulfill requirements of size to my flat (sorted from the cheapest one):
 1. HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Tiny i7-6700T (4x2,8-3,6GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 16GB 512GB SSD SATA - only 16GB of RAM and probably need to update from 2x8GB to 2x16GB in the future.
 2. HP Z240 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 480GB SSD SATA
 3. Dell OptiPlex 7040 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 500GB SSD NVMe <- think that it would be the most suitable, but I could be wrong :)
 4. DELL PRECISION T3420 Xeon E3-1240 v5 (4x3,6-3,9Ghz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD NVMe Nvidia Quadro K1200 - unnecessary graphic's card - I think, but Xeon on board.
 5. HP Z2 MINI G3 Xeon E3-1225 v5 (4x3,3-3,7GHz / 4 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD PCIe Nvidia Quadro M620 2GB GFX - again, unnecessary graphic's card, but I really like design :) 
 Thank you in advance :)

 www.name.com, or https://name.com, or just name.com
 i get "https://www.name.com"
 How do i get rid of that additional "www."?
 Edit: its just a simple apache2 server, no reverse proxy. Edit 2 : on the porkbun dns site, when you add a record, it asks you to put something in the "host" field. I typed www in there, because i have seen this working on other sites. Now i left the field empty and it worked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I spent my last weekend completely on tagging my music collection on my NAS. Scanning folder by folder with the Mp3tag software and giving it the correct album information one by one.
 Today I was adding the complete library in Plex... The outcome was not as expected... I have far more albums in Plex than folders on my NAS. In Plex, I see some albums multiple times, each with only two or three numbers of that album.
 I tried in Navidrome but that was even worse...
 What am I doing wrong? Is the tagging done wrong? Is there a better server solution?
 Thanks!

I also use a Synology NAS and utilize Nginx Proxy Manager to reach them outside my home. My question is, does it matter which server (host) I put my NPM on? Or should I separate it from my main cloud services host? I have two other available servers (hosts) but didn’t know what would be the best set up. I don’t want to affect the cloud server’s (Host’s) Nic…if that is even a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I would really love to use Cloudflare Tunnel for usecases where a VPN isn't possible. E.g. usage via company notebook.
 The great thing is the possibility to secure it directly via Cloudflare with Two-Factor Authentication, so any request must past Cloudflare Auth before getting to my private NGINX. For me much more secure when opening ports directly.
 However, as Cloudflare is generating the HTTPS certificate, they can as Man in the Middle read my traffic (passwords, data, etc) in plain text. Right?
 So is there any possibility to use Cloudflare Tunnel but to secure my data so it cannot be encrypted via Cloudflare?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 TLDR : i'm looking for an image gallery capable of precise geotagging, and showing it on a map at very little scale (~500m²).
 Full version : I'm in the team of an outdoor event, and each year we take a lot of technical pictures (where a thing is plugged, did we installed a trash here or here, where the hell water distribution was routed, etc.). Those images are invaluable for planning and correcting errors the next year, because plans rarely adapt to the reality, and details evolve organically.
 Generally, we have 700-1000 pictures, from diverse sources. It's complicated when all you have is a big folder to search in.
 So, i'm looking for a selfhosted app where you can geotag a photo, and show it on a map very close, showing roughly 500m² of terrain or less. Ideally an orientation indicator would be useful. A good point would be filtering the points/pictures by tags on the map. For tagging, OpenStreetMap is exact where we are, because of micro-mapping and high precision points, and all that matters is relative positioning anyway.
 I'm already testing apps, but what i want is never a selling point. Map view are often limited to a low zoom, or the pictures shown in full instead of points. Basically i need to install every single one listed on the big list, and it's not an efficient process, when i can ask for help here too ! ;)
 Thanks !

 I tried to take a different approach them other guides out there by focusing more on using config as code practices and automating much of the install using ansible and terraform.
 The previous parts of the series focus on installing vmware vsphere 8 and using terraform to create all the virtual machines that kubernetes gets installed on.
 I have been using this process over the last year or two for my own homelab cluster so figured I'd clean up my notes, create a blog, and see if anyone else finds it helpful.
 Let me know what you think so I can try to make the content better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I'm a college student studying IT, and I'd like to build a home server since I currently just have a laptop I use for school. I haven't completely decided all the things I'd like to host on this server, but I know at the very least I'd like to use it as a 24/7 Jellfyin/multimedia server and NAS, along with the capability to run other VMs and containers. The OS would be Unraid or another Linux distro.
 I also want it to be small and as power efficient as possible. Here's my current parts list for this build:
  
CPU: Intel Core i3-12100 ($124)
 CPU Heatsink: Noctua NH-L9i-17xx ($45)
 Mobo: ASRock B660M-ITX/AC ($120)
 Memory: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 RAM ($80)
 Boot Drive: SAMSUNG 970 EVO PLUS M.2 2280 500GB ($67)
 Storage: 3x WD Red 4TB NAS ($210)
 Case: Fractal Design Node 304 ($99)
 PSU: FSP 450W Mini ITX Solution ($80)
  
This is the first computer I've built as a server (rather than for gaming), so any thoughts/suggestions are greatly appreciated. I'm also not against getting anything pre-built, so I'm happy to hear about any alternatives as well.

 ​
 I have already installed postfix configured as it indicates in the digital ocean tutorial I use smtp as I only send
 ​
 But now, how do I add a user who is the one who posts in my iposte.io as smtp relay and how to send all the emails that I have in my poste.io through the postfix of my vps
 ​
 What I need is a server equal to sendgrid, mailgun, etc. in my own vps. How do I protect and connect to my server in the vps?
 ​
 I have installed
 ​
 -----postfix
 -----libsasl2-2 sasl2-bin
 ​
 My user already creates my user but I cannot connect to my server with these led credentials I leave as I have my sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for a server that I can use to host and stream <2TB worth of videos, which may later expand to 4TB, but I doubt it may expand over that, these are the types of videos I have want that I want to stream.
  
one-on-one zoom consultations I've done
 
ripped youtube videos 
 
Videos ripped from online courses I've paid for
 
personal recorded videos recorded using my phone
 
 My idea is to have a dedicated media(video) library where I can have it all in one dashboard. Instead of having to open up multiple tabs or files (i.e. youtube, google chrome, etc.). 
 I don't want to host these videos on any cloud services (i.e. OneDrive, Google Drive, mega.nz, etc.). For fear thay my files/videos get flagged as copyright and my account suspended.
 I'd also like to have the ability to create embedded video links, to put onto my Personal Knowledge Management System (PKM System), which would most likely be a combination of Notion, OneNote and Nimbus Note.
 I already have a Synology NAS DS218+ that I use for cold storage back-up, but it's not suited to host media. I also don't want to have a NAS were I store sensitive files and at the same time open to the web with media hosting. I want these two things, physically compartmentalized.
 I will be the only dedicated-user of these media files being streamed, so there is no worry of bandwidth, when streaming video files.

 Most media servers let you quickly find something to watch, then you watch it in full on a chosen device. I wanted something else that was for browsing around and adding more granular metadata.
 I made a thing for digging around in your content and adding tags to specific moments. It has animated thumbnails and you can transcribe media that have no subtitles.

 I have been trying to decide what direction to take this in, but I have been struggling to find people to ask.

 I knew I was planning a new living room PC soon, and having it double as a NAS, so I kept it. I ordered another 16TB SAS drive and a SAS RAID controller a couple weeks ago to put the new computer together. I want to make a basic RAID 1.
 Windows shows the controller as "Avago adapter sas3 3008 fury - StorPort" and says the driver is good, but I don't see any sign of the connected drives, or any UI to set up the controller.
 Are there any good guides for this? Any guides I've found assume SATA drives and either the RAID support on the motherboard or Windows virtual volumes -- and that you can actually see that the drives exist before you get started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, yeah, another "Debian vs. Ubuntu" thread. I'm asking because a lot of the threads I'm finding are many years old where I guess Ubuntu peeved some people and they moved away from them to Debian. I also know that people generally think Debian is more stable but, again, those threads were quite old. I don't really know if thats much the case anymore.
 Right now, I have a mix of Debian and Ubuntu containers in Proxmox but I want to standardize on one. I'm leaning towards Ubuntu Server for one reason: I have no idea why, but apt update and apt upgrade on my Debian containers is painfully slow. I mean, REALLY slow. I've tried everything and just can't figure out why.
 Another reason I'm leaning towards Ubuntu is because of commercial support. Obviously, I don't need commercial support at home but if we start migrating some services at work to Linux (which I think we may), I'm sure management would want to go with the distro that offers support. I'd prefer to use at work what I'm familiar with at home.
 Other than that, is there any other reason I should stick with Debian that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 I tend to find myself having weird 'me only' issues when hoarding. Im currently sat at over 1m images, from deviantart, pixiv, pinterest but then i discovered wallhaven.....you can see where this is going.
 Assuming you are using gallery-dl with the '--write-metadata' option to download an ID search or batch of single images it will check the json for the file for the username, create a folder structure and then sort the files for that user to the correct folder.
 it'll then add the user account to a txt file for batch downloading of that users uploads. Eventually, ill no doubt have all the user accounts (if they have uploaded) but i then use this for more downloads.
 As an example, i download all the images tagged for cyberpunk 2077 lets say around 300, this is parsed i then have 90 users ready to go and end up with 100k images after running that list. They state they only have about 1m images themselves so shouldn't take long to get it all then just append to my collection.
 I couldn't find a list of all users, a search all(*) or a list of how many IDs they have. But if you know, let me know. I could have just iterated over IDs in a loop 1 to 999999 but thats possibly a lot of waste.
 Anyway......
 As i say, this fits my need for how i scrape stuff from there but thought id share it should someone want to improve/make use of it. Its powershell btw

 My plex is hosted at: 192.168.1.2:32400 but kuma always states: 
 [Plex] [DOWN] Connect EHOSTUNREACH 192.168.1.2:32400
 Does anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong? Plex is hosted on a windows server machine, and kuma is inside a docker container running inside an ubuntu server vm on the same device (vm's private ipv4 is 192.168.1.3) TIA.

 90+% of the blurays are LTH 25gb
 Would a 8TB be good enough to store all them? Since streaming is so abundant now and looks to be for the forseeable future unless something serious happened to the world ( nowadays who can say, would it be better to find them on the net when I want?
 Will an external HD be ok if written to and then only accessed when needed ( once or twice a month) and then shut off? 
 I am getting older and plan on retiring in next 10 years. I will have plenty of time to watch all my "classic" movies a that time. So I am wanting to store all this until I retire. Then my family can deal with it when I pass.... HAHA dont know what they are in for
 32TB so far not including blurays

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m struggling here.
 I’d like to run Nextcloud so that it syncs only when my iOS devices are either 1) locally connected to network or 2) VPN’d remotely.
 I don’t want to expose a public IP or use reverse proxy.
 VPN is setup and working properly on my router & router has ddns address.
 Nextcloud All-In-One docker is installed on Mint Linux box but during setup NC asks for domain and does not allow IP (why?)
 Now I’m stuck bc I dont have a public domain. I have a ddns IP from NoIP for the VPN but not sure this NoIP domain is what I want to use (along with router port forwarding) since its public facing.
 I think an option is to create a private domain via technitium’s zone and point the router to this DNS so that the iOS devices use the DNS but I’m not sure this will work when VPN’d.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After losing a couple SSD's the pain of losing my files was too great. I started doing some research and bought a TerraMaster D4-300 and two 12Tb HDD. I am unsure what would be the best next steps for backing up my files. 
 My initial strategy was to start backing up on one HDD 1 and then set up HDD 2 as a mirrored backup. Now that I have it all plugged in, I am unsure about the best way to do that and looking for advice. I am working from a 4TB Macbook Pro that will go back and forth to work with me and ideally, the TM will be a part of a desk/monitor set up I can just connect laptop to when working from home. 
 Something like drivepool seems perfect for what I need but I can see from other posts that's not an option for Mac. Should I just set up a ChronoSync task to mirror HDD 1 to HDD 2 and sync whenever I add files?
 I'm a noob at all this so any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

My one issue: the enclosure has a built in power save/sleep function that I cannot disable. Tried going through and making sure APM was disabled, spindown was disabled, etc, but after exhausting all resources I am fairly sure this is a function of the enclosure(even though it is not listed in the product info anywhere I can find). this causes extremely slow load times for Plex initially and can cause temporary hangups browsing files, etc. Anyone know of a good 3.5" enclosure that does not have a sleep function? I have been looking online and this was the best option that did not list powersave, and ended up having it anyway. Not ready to pull the trigger on an add-on board yet for the Pi. Thanks for any replies!

Anna’s Archive is active on the normal internet—no need for Tor—and has an “About” page that says: “This website was created by Anna, the person behind the Pirate Library Mirror, which is a backup of the Z-Library shadow library.” And I estimate that people with 300 terabytes of disk space have the ability to personally mirror the totality of the shadow-library material that exists—maybe that’s irrelevant, but the fact that people can personally mirror the totality of the content in question might make it harder to crack down on shadow libraries.

 ​
 I used to have a pentium 6500 ,12GB DDR4, 10TB HDD as my homeserver, sold it and for the last two years I used my gaming PC to complete these tasks;
 Plex, 2x Linux VM running in hyperv.
 ​
 I don't have a problem to be honest with this, apart from that I hate hearing the HDD noise next to me and the 3x ethernet cables it runs out. So I decided, I would like to have a little homeserver , again.
 This time, I looked around and I have seen that I only need Plex to be able to run (no transcoding, everything is in 1080p and my upload is 150mbit/s, only 2 people use it)
 The VMs are: DNS and webserver, both only run very little traffic.
 I would love to listen to suggestions, as Synology is horrible priced, I would like to keep this a super small form factor(HP Prodesk g4??? or mac mini (this would be my favourite tbh, but I don't like the fact that I would need to use USB for the 3.5 HDD) 
 Then, I have come across used Proliant gen9 servers. I mean, they seem to be percfect. Apart from that they are outdated, I could probably run proxmox or unraid on them, allocate cores and memory properly and completetly avoid using windows (this would be another big point for me) 
 Oh and my budget is maximum £250.(used or new) 
 On my previous, I ran Windows and I hated it, Windows for me is only for gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, new on here and generally new to the whole self hosting thing apart from pihole.
 Currently I’m running just pihole and unbound on raspberry B+ (2014) model on dietpi. My goal is to be able to use it outside of my home network in the SAFEST way possible with least amount of lag possible.
 I would rather spend some extra time to achieve both (if possible) than to take a shortcut. I’ve heard about wireguard, Tailscale and zetotier but not looked deep enough to decide which one is the best approach of the three.
 What i was hoping to do was fresh install of everything on a new sd card for two reasons; in case things go south i still have copy of current setup on old card and secondly so that i can easily follow certain guide as its been a while since i setup the pihole. I have some extra questions i want to ask for future planning.
  
How many things can i run on this raspberry pi? In near future i want to try few other things I’ve come across such as bookmark manager like shiori or password manager like Bitwarden/vaultwarden2.
 if I can run more than just the pihole setup mentioned in second paragraph, whats the best approach? And how?
 Does it make sense to use flash drive (if possible) to run this on for extra reliability.
 say someone is able to access my pihole, aside from my dns queries what other data can they access
  
My ultimate goal for future would be to use pihole as primary dns and have everything else running on some server (post for another day)
 I would really appreciate any help you guys can provide. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. A while ago I started building a solution for managing my projects. Even though I kind of have it working, I feel like there should be an existing solution for this that could be of more value for me. Here is my situation:
 I have a few machines running on my network, each of them runs some projects of mine. When I want to run a project, I log on to the machine, clone the repo and run a command to build and serve it.
 I develop and update projects from my main machine, and whenever I push an update I have to log on to the relevant machine and do the whole process manually over again.
 What I would like is to be able to upgrade, rebuild, and rerun the projects on each machine, from a central dashboard of some sort, eliminating the need to log on to each machine. Ideally I would like to hook this up with some git events so that the whole process is automated.
 I feel like there has to be some software that does this, that's not enterprise level. I was recently looking at portainer, which I think does what I want, but I don't have everything in containers so it doesn't work for me.
 ​
 Surely someone here has experience with this problem and can offer some advice!
 Thanks a lot in advance for any help.

I just purchased a second external HDD and am copying between the two and have hit 180+ mbs per second which I was not expecting.
 To add further confusion the new drive is plugged into my slower USB port which (they are both 3.0) ruled so by testing an external drive in each port on opposite sides of the laptop, this slower port gets 15 mb/s when transferring from my internal drive.
 Wondering what the bottleneck could be and if there's anything I can do.

The problem is I have no idea how to accomplish this. Ive been looking online saying I have to finalize the disks but we lost the Camera a long time ago. And the DVD player I have now is too big for the disk and it doesn’t reach the laser for it to be read. i’ve submitted some pictures for context. Links to products I could use and just advice in general would be much appreciated. I thank any and all who answer in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have 5 Raspberry Pis in my rack doing various things (Home Assistant, lighter Docker containers, reverse proxy, vpn, PiHole, etc.) and am thinking about swapping them out to a thin client or two. I want to try my hand with Proxmox as a hypervisor (possibly try my hands as a cluster).
 I have been doing a bit of research and found that the main contenders seem to be Lenovo ThinkCentre/ThinkStation, HP EliteDesk/Prodesk, and Dell Micro. The STH article that is getting passed around is a couple of years old and does not look to be updated with any newer recommended models.
 Do you all think that it would be worth swapping out most of my Raspberry Pis for a couple of thin clients? If so, what models should I be looking for? Mainly looking for a good balance between power and performance while being hopefully on the cheaper side. Again, I will hopefully be playing around with Proxmox as a cluster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm just getting started in self-hosting and I've set up a homebrew calendar application in Django that used to be rent-hosted. So now I have it run on a old laptop in my office, and I use ddns.org for dynamic DNS. I'd like to start up a second service on the same machine, and access the original calendar service at a URL like myfake.ddnsdomain.org/calendar/ and the new notes-like service at myfake.ddnsdomain.org/notes/
 I tried using nginx to redirect the /calendar/ URL suffix from my HTTP port to a different port on which the Django app was running, and that worked for the initial page, but that same suffix was not appended the follow-up HTTP requests from the client side. How can I achieve this behavior without modifying the code for the calendar app? (Of course, I can technically do it for the calendar app, but then I wouldn't have a solution for the other services...)
 Is this possible? Or do I have to do something different, like should I do a 301 request to a different port and open multiple on my home router?

 I'm looking at either lorex or night owl.
 My question is if I have the nvr base in my rack, do my cameras need t9 connect directly to it or can I utilize existing wall Jack's? I know I'll need poe.
 My goal is an NVr box that can take ip cameras and wireless.
 I'm also open to non wyze suggestions lol.

 I currently have Synlogy DS214Play with two 4TB HDDs.
 I have a cctv software with one camera and plex installed, and they work great.
 Unfortunately Docker is not supported on DS214Play and I'm looking for some alternatives.
 My requirements are:
 - Network storage
 - Plex
 - Ability to install various packages, for example https://www.home-assistant.io/ or similar.
 - Ability to install a few CCTV cameras with CCTV management software. I would prefer something different than built-in synology software.
 Basically it would be nice if I could run everything on docker.
 What hardware do you recommend that is similar in physical size to synology boxes (can be synology). I don't have a space for a rack in my flat.

 I delete these filters because I am worried that by leaving them then only .png .gif .jpg .jpeg .css .js files will be downloaded and all the other files won't be downloaded, am I correct? 
 So I delete the filters and I leave the page blank, but what does happen when the page is left blank? I tried to use the filter +* to see if it is the same thing but then other files are downloaded if I leave the page blank and different files are downloaded if I use the +* filter.
 My question is what is downloaded when no filter is used?
 Another question, what's the difference between this filters:
 +*.png +*.gif +*.jpg +*.jpeg +*.css +*.js -ad.doubleclick.net/* -mime:application/foobar 
 and this filters:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this topic comes up often but my situation is a little different. I have four servers total running in my rack and two of them are TrueNAS boxes. One is simply being used as a backup (replication) so I was wondering instead of running this server 24/7, why not power it off and have it turn on once a week, replicate and shutdown? Seems reasonable enough. 
 Any downsides other than not having replication running more often? At 325w being drawn at 0.33 cents is around $77 a month for me. I know my wattage is rookie numbers considering what others here are running.

 I received a stack of 19 Memorex DVDs from a relative to put them on a flash drive for Christmas. I've gone through 13 so far and 6 have come back with issues.
 In MakeMKV, all but one disc reported:
 Error 'Scsi error - MEDIUM ERROR:L-EC UNCORRECTABLE ERROR' occurred while reading
 The other disc had a different error I don't remember and haven't seen since. Some others were completely unreadable. Some discs were accessible through other means, but any video I could retrieve are severely corrupted so I'll have to copy a bunch of tapes as well to fill in the gaps.
 No discs had any visible damage. No bit rot no scratches. They've been untouched since 2005.
 I'm not asking for any advice, just recording my experience with these discs for others to reference and maybe kick their butt into gear to update their storage situation.

 Now I'd like to install quite a few services that usually run in a docker container like piHole/Adguard, Whoogle, TrueNas or similar for Storage, and maybe Yacht so that I am able to install more services easily.
 My question is, what is the best way to go to set these up? Should I use Proxmox LXC Containers, a designated linux vm in Proxmox or should I directly run the services as docker containers on the Proxmox Debian installation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just reading the arch wiki on setting up RAID and it mentions it's highly recommended to partition the device used for RAID. But it doesn't really explain why. Could someone enlighten me please? Aside from the later suggestion of leaving 100 MiB on the end to make replacement easier is there a reason I should partition the drive before putting it into RAID?
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID#Partition_the_devices
 Note: yesterday I did just this but using LVM. So I had 2 18TiB drives, I created 32 partitions about 0.5TiB each and then put them into an LV with total size 18TiB and RAID1 across each device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been struggling to self host SimpleLogin on my home server where my internet provider provided a public ip which is usually changed from time to time because I do not subscribe for the much higher price fixed public ip.
 simple-login/app: The SimpleLogin back-end (github.com) 
 I understand that the installation guide provided in the GITHUB link above is based on the self-host environment where the server has a permanent fixed public IP?
 I've installed it on the home server and added all the DNS records required on Cloudflare where I managed my registered domain. I can open up the SimpleLogin signup webui and the signup email verification was successfully sent to Yahoo by postfix (I know by looking at the /var/log/mail.log), but my yahoo inbox/spam box never got the mail. So I'm stuck. I suspect it has something to do with the system mail name, my domain, etc. that I setup for Postfix. 
 My internet provider doesn't block port 25, so it is not a port problem.
 My home servers:
 - PfSense box running HAProxy as a reversed proxy
 - Self-hosted SimpleLogin was installed on Debian VM (which runs on my Unraid server)
 - mydomainname.com was registered at Namecheap but I transferred the DNS management to Cloudflare. All subdomains set on Cloudflare DNS are working fine hand in hand with my pfSense HAProxy. 
 Any advice would be appreciated.

 A bit new to selfhosting - currently have a RPi4 running FreshRSS & NextcloudPi behind an nginx reverse proxy, all hosted in docker containers.
 I have a database of articles including a section and article link - there are a total of about ~10,000 articles in it. I would like to create an RSS feed that randomly picks up one article every day and sends it to FreshRSS, so I can read the articles on my phone/linux system. 
 Any information on how to do this easily is very much appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. 
 I have a number of different small scripts to automate and integrate various tasks. I've used UnRaid's Custom User Scripts to host these over the past couple years. Things are starting to become unmanageable and I've starting looking into a more robust solution.
 At the end of the day, I'm looking for some application to run python scripts, manage environments, integrate with GitHub, and have some centralized scheduler. Things like logging, error notifications, or managing credentials would all be solid extras. 
 Most of the applications I've found seem overly complex, resource intensive, or just completely miss the mark. Things like JupyterHub, Jenkins, Airflow, VS Code Server, and others. 
 Airflow is probably the front runner, however it is still much, much more than what I'm really looking for. I feel like I'm searching the wrong keywords...
 Any recommendations?

Ideally, I get a pfSense/OPNSense router feeding the switch, but this will have to wait until I can source some well-priced hardware.
 Right now, I only have the router my ISP provided me with. Is it possible to connect a Cisco managed switch to an ISP router? I (at the moment) don't have any other way of providing IP addresses, other than this router which acts as an AP as well as DNS/DHCP server. 
 Total newbie - any advice is well received. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dell r720 that I'm having issues setting up/booting.
 The system powers on when the power button is pressed and the front LCD panel says "System Booting" but there is no video output on either the front or back VGA ports. I have tested my VGA cable and monitor on my other r720 and it works. I have also done a NVRAM jumper reset to make sure the embedded video controller wasn't disabled. No error codes show on the LCD and their are no error beeps (unless those can be disabled). When the system finishes "booting" the front LCD displays the system name and all other menus properly. Not sure what the issue could be so I'm checking here to see if any of you have any ideas.
 ​
 EDIT: This system does not have the enterprise IDRAC license so I cannot confirm boot or enter the system through there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently I've been moving away from rackmount hardware to SFF machines to reduce my power usage, heat and noise.
 I've had some good success running Proxmox on HP EliteDesk SFF units and have been finding Intel AMT to be a suitable alternative to iLo/iDrac and am currently experimenting with MeshCommander/MeshCentral.
 On the HP site there is a firmware update tool for updating Intel AMT.However the included firmware is quite old and the tool is designed for either DOS/EFI.
 The newer firmware updates appear to be designed for Windows only.
 Is there a way to flash the Intel AMT firmware from within Linux IE Debian/Proxmox?If so, how I determine which firmware I need?
 The download from HP appears to include two bin files, C0_LP and D0_H.
 Thanks in advance for any help/advice.
 EDIT: I've more or less given up on the idea of doing this from within Linux for now and used this method:
  
I formatted a USB disk as fat32.
 Created a folder structure /efi/boot
 Placed the tianocore EFI shell in the boot folder named Boot64.efi https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/UDK2018/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64/Shell.efi
 From the HP flash tool download extracted with 7zip, copied the FWUpdLcl.efi and MEInfo.efifiles from the MEFlash and MEInfo directories to the USB disk.
 From the HP firmware download extracted with 7zip, copied both of the .bin files (H and LP) from the ME directory.
 Booted the machine from the USB Disk to get into an EFI shell
 Ran FS0: to change to the root of the USB disk (dir to check I'm in the right place)
 Ran MEInfo.efi to determine what firmware was running. In the output I saw I was running "H" rather than "LP".
 Ran FWUpdLcl.efi -f ME_11.8_Corporate_D0_H_Production.bin to flash the "H" firmware
 Rebooted and verified I was running the new AMT version with MeshCommander.

I see that there are multiple slots for hot swap SAS drives and a few for SAYA drives but I don't quite understand what type of drive I should be buying. I'm looking online and I see the HDD and sdd's however they don't have a mounting bracket. In my server I see there's a bunch of blanks. Am I supposed to fit the drives inside those? Also it it only SATA or ISCSI or something? Can someone explain this terminology for me? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until recently I’ve been running: - Synology NAS (Plex and NFS for other devices) - 3x Mac minis (2011) running Proxmox as a playground and to host a few services for the home - 1x Intel NUC (D54250WYKH i5-4250U) as a Home-Assistant box 
 This is great as a playground, but with the current cost of energy, I’m kind of wishing I had just ONE tiny/mini/micro system that could run Proxmox and then my same few VMs to replace the bare minimum of what I need.
 I’ve been reading up on the Serve The Home site and their great video series, and I’ve been considering:
  
Lenovo ThinkCentre M720Q (9th Gen Intel i5 9400T)
 HP EliteDesk 800 G4 
 Optiplex 3070
 Optiplex 7050
  
I DID try experimenting with two Raspberry Pi 4s I had, but they are just 2GB RAM models and I quickly ate that!
 So could anyone recommend a good bang-for-pound 😆 machine that I could pickup for around £200 used? Is it worthwhile to punt for the newer generation chipsets for power efficiency?

 Can anyone speak to the performance of either? I’ve heard that proxmox ceph suffers from high overhead and is borderline unusable. Sadly my node with the most compute power for virtualization is also the one with the most drive bays.

 I've recently been working on turning my old Desktop into my own home server and so far it's been going great, at least until I got stuck at creating new pools via TrueNAS Scale..
 I've got an 18tb and another 4tb hard drive and planned to use them in 2 pools:
 One Pool for RAID1, so I'd be using the entire 4tb drive and 4tb of the larger drive to create a pool where I keep my most important data and one using the rest of the 18tb drive as a regular data pool.
 ​
 However after creating the RAID1 Pool, I realized that I can no longer select my 18tb drive to add as a data vdev... could someone tell me how I can use the rest of my 18tb drive alongside RAID1 if that's possible?

I'd really like to host some services for my friends, though not all are web-based. I heard about Pomerium and am a little confused as to why people are using it in conjunction with Traefik. It seems to me that practically it is traefik for my k8-less uses but would allow for easier monitoring of who is using my services? I really like the idea of having to approve of each device on Pomerium before they can use any service of mine, and I'm not sure if that's possible with Authentik.
 If anyone has any knowledge they could enlighten me with here that would be cool! Does Traefik + Authentik work well for hosting a game server?

 I have an HP DL20 Gen9 which currently has two SATA SSDs installed.
 I'd like to upgrade to two NVMe SSDs installed on two PCIe to M.2 adapters like this one.
 The system doesn't seem to support PCIe bifurcation so I guess I should be fine by just using two separate adapters, right? 
 The system has one internal PCIe x16 slot which has a PCIe riser which splits that port into two PCIe x8 ports. Can I just install a PCIe to NVMe adapter in each of them? 
 Thank you!

 It’s a 14tb WD easystore from bestbuy I bought 12 months ago. I have a bunch of easystore boxes and the housing and stuff, but I don’t know which housing and box matches the one that died. Does that matter? Or can I just put any other housing and box on it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. Recently my mother's workplace has moved buildings. They found a better place, cleaner, where it already had furniture. I decided that, in hopes of finding something that I could use/learn from, I would go to the old place to tear through the remaining stuff in the office. The equipment was never registered properly and I was told there are no problems if I take them because of that. So I did, and I found some pretty interesting stuff. 
 I'm pretty new to homelabbing (not entirely new) but these were the first things I would get for free. 
 An HP switch, 48 ports, only 4 are GbE (2 RJ45+2 SFP)
 ​
 Cisco 881, FE ports only
 ​
 There's a VPN sticker on it. I suppose it was used for tunneling to the headquarters.
 ​
 8 Port GbE PoE switch. Pretty neat!
 Haven't booted this yet, unsure about specs, it just says SA4. I'll use this as the host for my CNC router since it has a LPT port on the back.
 This HP Compaq which - as you will see in the photo below - I called \"scrapyard\". Sorry for the lurking finger.
 ​
 I tried to install BSD but after flashing the USB it just wouldn't boot from the BIOS.
 I also got a lot of cat5e/cat6 wires. And one single mode fiber, too! (~5m)
 Overall I'd say I could find a use for these. Please let me know what you guys think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/DataHoarder, first time long time.
 I have two hard drives I need some quick help with.
 Drive #1
 First is a Western Digital (I know) Red 3TB drive in my PR4100 NAS (I know, I know). Right now the software flags it but does not tell me why. When I check the SMART data via the NAS software, it seems to give me the same info for all 4 drives. (Clicking SMART on 2,3,4 all give the same numbers) This drive is under warranty, so I plan to buy a Seagate and use the RMA WD as a cold backup. But any info on how to get a SMART dump from that individual drive, or figure exactly why it's showing as bad, would be appreciated. This is my second WD drive to die within a year of purchase.
 Drive #2
 Second is a 4TB Western Digital (I know, I know, I know) Blue sitting inside my desktop. This one is giving me an Uncorrectable Sector Count. CrystalDisk just flags it as caution, but I'm not very familiar on the risk here. Also WD's software gives it a cleanbill of health. Should I just replace it, or is it fine for the time being? There is nothing really critical on that drive, so it's not a big problem if it just bites the dust out of the blue. But I would rather avoid it if possible.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished reading BRKSEC-2202 - Understanding and Preventing Layer 2 Attacks in IPv4 Network (2013). I learnt about attacks in layer 2 and ways to mitigate them.
 These attacks seems easy to perform, and also easy to mitigate (just enable things like DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP inspection and IP source guard in your switch).
 Unfortunately, my current smart switch (Zyxel GS1900) does not offer these security features.
 Then again, these attacks require the malicious actor to be inside my network. They have to physically get into my house to do that (they can also brute force my wifi password or trick me to install some malicious software), and if that's the case then they can do much more than these "layer 2 attacks".
 Do you have these layer 2 security features at your homelab? Do you think they are essential to a secure homelab?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up cloudflare zero trust, so I can generate some traffic over it. I will be honest, I'm doing this just so I can get a code for yubikey, since I'm interested in a hardware 2FA key and how they work and this is a deal which I wouldn't want to miss. I know the deal is valid until the end of December, so I want to try to get the code. 
 So far, I applied for the offer, but I got an email saying right now, I'm not eligible. What I did meantime is:
  
Run a vaultwarden docker container on a laptop which has an IP 192.168.1.x and I can access it from other local devices.
 On zero cloud website under Access > Applications, I added the app, with a type "Private net" and application url is the IP above, allow rule for policies
 Created a tunnel under access > tunnels and run a connector on the same laptop where the docker is. Once it was run, status was connected on the website
 Next thing I did is I created a user under my team > users. Login method is one-time PIN which gets sent on the email.
 When I login, I type team domain I got from settings > general, it asks for email, sends the code, I type it in and it shows the app I created in the step two.
 The problem is, when I click the app, it redirects me to the IP 192.168.1.x as it's an application url, but only if I'm on the local WiFi. If I try the procedure from my mobile data, obviously it fails as it redirects to the mentioned IP
  
In both cases (WiFi and mobile data) it doesn't generate any traffic on cloudflare website at all as DNS requests, top logins by app are empty. So can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong or which step I'm missing?

However, s there a way to disable the history option? I found the cleanup parameters, but that doesn’t seem to be what I’m looking for. If there is no way, I can keep the parameters set to 1 day. Thank you for your help

 The drives arrived in good condition, correct packaging and sealed anti-static bags. Unfortunately, one of the bad serial numbers is from a DOA drive that needs to be exchanged. I will call support on Monday. I'm just interested if anyone else has experienced this from WD Store fulfilled drives. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought 20tb WD Elements HDD on Black Friday, run smartctl short & long test and used GSmartControl to view the results. All the stats seemed to be alright and the HDD passed the test. Except in the statistics tab, I found that the HDD had "Number of Mechanical Start Failures" value 29. I haven't found much info online and so I contacted WD support and they advised me to replace the HDD, which I did. Yesterday I (finally) received new HDD, and already, after running short test (not sure if I even had to run the test TBH), I am seeing that the NoMSF is 28.
 What the hell, I need to populate my media server!
 Should I replace it again, risk it, repair it (yeah, nah)? Does anyone have any similar experience, or knowledge that can help?
 ​
 Also. I have some crazy RAW values for 2 "unknown attributes", but I guess that's some proprietary WD thingie which GSC can't read?

 I just noticed I accidentally deleted almost all of my Logic sessions this week.
 To clean up my desktop I put everything in a folder, and by mistake I deleted that folder.
 I have some backups, but not of recent sessions and not of component files like drum kits.
 Please, give me all your suggestions for what I should do to go about recovering my life’s work. I have contacted a local data recovery service about an appointment. NYC area. 2016 MBP OS Catalina.
 This post may be slightly orthogonal to the subreddit but this is devastating to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody. I'm having as slight problem. I usually deploy my selfhosted app locally, but after some down time in some work critical apps (my isp sucks), i decided to go VPS route for those that i need high availability. The problem i came across is that now i have to use firewall to restrict access to ports i dont want to be access from the outside. Here comes the problem, I tried iptables, ufw, firewalld always worked fine till a restart, after that i found that docker overwirtes the rules and pass its rules first... 
 I found whalewall, and I get some success with it, but i ask myself, that is the best way to do it? Can some of you with more experience and knowledge about this give me a few directions for this simple situation.
 My objective is to pass most my docker apps through nginx proxy, with a exception of one or another.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use tailscale and I can reach my server using the domain offered by them: 
 curl <my\_machine\_name>.<domain\_from\_tailscale>.ts.net
 The entry point on my server is a traefik instance and I'm trying to configure it to route to all other services:
 This is my usual configuration on the docker-compose.yml 
 ````
 labels:
 - "traefik.enable=true"
 - "traefik.http.services.flame.loadbalancer.server.port=5005"
 - "traefik.http.routers.flame.rule=Host(`flame.<tailscaledomain>.ts.net`)"
 - "traefik.http.routers.flame.entrypoints=web"
 ```
 ​
 but that doesn't work, I guess because tailscale doesn't know how to route this sub domain.
 is anyone having a similar setup?

 I've setup a global schedule with a snapshot time of 0:00 but the history and logs say that no snapshots were taken so far. Do I need to have a kopia daemon/service/container for regular snapshots?.. What is the correct way of setting this up?

 Is there anything like that available on the market?

Has anyone had any experience with this device, or would you recommend another, or in fact, would you suggest I just stick with running everything on my 918+??

Aruba AOW4010 as my main gigabit switch
 ZyXEL (idk the model) 100 mbit/s switch as a backup
 Random blank patch panel from amazon
 Fiber optic lc to lc patch panel from a friend
 3x HP Compaq SFF pc's from school: 
 One running Truenas Scale, 1x 160Gb HDD as a boot drive, 500Gb and 8Tb HDDs as my Pool running a few NFS and SMB shares and running my plex, sonarr, radarr, etc... services
 One running Proxmox, with VMs for PiHole, a Minecraft Server, a MySQL database, a simple website, a Signum Plotter and Miner, connected to my mentioned NFS share. MC, DB and PiHole VMs are automatically backed up to my Truenas Box daily.
 The last one running OPNSense. Connecting to it via OpenVPN, because I want to keep my Lab separated from the rest of our network.
 
  
I know, cable management, etc... is pretty bad at the moment, but for now, this is just a proof of concept. I've only spent about 80€ so far, 50€ for the rack itself, 20€ for the blank patch panel, and about 10€ for the keystones and cage nuts, I can't really complain. I'm still going to school, so I'm on a pretty tight budget, but I'll do the most out of it.

 The project uses microservices with k3s, and I have a service which builds containers based on a GitHub repo the user uploads. The cluster is also responsible for taking the built containers and running them in their own separate namespace. I'm skeptical that the Pis won't be powerful enough to host all the services as well as build and run containers simultaneously, and I don't know how well it will scale either.
 I wanted to start with a 3-4 node cluster of RPI CM4s, but are there any alternatives I should consider over an RPI cluster?

 x399 1920x mellanox 455A
 I almost finished the hardware part of my first NAS and now I need to chose an OS and NAS software. I was wondering what you would chose.
 The requirements are:
  
very little command line, easy to setup and use, easy to expand when I add drives
 RAID0 m.2 for the work drive, auto backup to HDD
 I'd like to get close to the throughput of the mellanox while keeping power consumption lowest possible.
 eventually install a git server and a davinci resolve server, the resolve server has a linux variant
 after I chose which 4x m.2 card I prefer, that'll free up one port for a GPU, then this NAS can be used as a desktop to do work, no gaming
 the client is a windows machine connected directly to it via a twinax cable and the second NIC is linked to the wifi router for desktop access
 if setting it up in RDMA that's be cool to offload the cpu, as long as it's easy to do
  
Thanks!

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just installed Umbrel on my server and I am currently setting it up. I am following this guide that I found on this sub to set up a Jellyfin Media Server. The guide uses qBittorent in the set up, but sadly Umbrel doesn't have it in its app store. I am still new to this, so I would prefer to avoid the figuring out of how to install it manually and enable access to other containers like Radarr and Sonarr from it.
 So is there any way to use Transmission to have multiple download folders? IPer the tutorial, categories are created in qBittorrent with different save paths. So that torrents from Radarr download into one folder and torrents from Sonnar download into another folder. Making it much easier to organize a Jellyfin library. Is something like this possible with Transmission? If not, those of you who use transmission, how do you organize your Jellyfin library?
 P.S. I saw Umbrel has community stores you can add. Any trustworthy one that has qb there?

I have a Dell r720 which had both a bricked iDrac and a failing emmc with the “failed to write errors” after find this out I bought 2 replacement emmc chips off eBay to try replace the dead flash. Then lost the chips for 6 months… after I had found them again the fun began.
 I have a decent hot air station which definitely helps in doing this, also flux and board preheating helps tremendously otherwise you risk lifting traces. I took the motherboard out of…]]></summary>

 Basically i am looking for a program that will automatically record twitch livestreams. Currently i just manually record using browser extensions but i often end op missing big parts of the stream as i dont notice they went live. I tried searching around but i cant find anything that dosent require you to have 20 years of experience in IT to download/use. VODs wont work since they have muted parts or are straight up not uploaded.
 All i would want it to do is automatically detect when a set streamer goes live and record it untill they go offline. Just in case it should also not corrupt the files if the stream crashes or otherwise goes out (on the streamers end).
 Know of anything i could use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I purchased a z620 on ebay... someone I've purchased from before. It won't boot and they are taking their time responding so I thought in the meantime I'd pick the community's brain.
 I've tested with several CPUs and several sticks of memory both 2 and 4gig. 
 I've tried another video card.
 I've re-seated every cable and I've tried it with no CPU and/or no memory in varying combinations.
 With any CPU installed and one or two memory sticks I get a single beep.... And HP's list of beep codes shows 2 beeps and 3 beeps etc.... but NOTHING for a single beep. 
 Furthermore even at idle pre-boot the cpu heats up something fierce.... possibly just because the fan isn't spinning yet? 
 The led on the motherboard is solid blue and the PSU light is solid green (I think it was green?)
 The bios has been reset several times plus I've flushed the PSU caps by unplugging and holding power.
 I never get a video signal under any of these conditions. The fans ramp up sometimes tho I'm afraid I missed making notes about what combinations of the above result in this.
 Any ideas? Is this just a toast MB? PSU? Is it haunted by the ghost of Nicola Tesla?
 Thanks!

 I'm looking to expand my general purpose server (Proxmox w/ TrueNAS VM + others) storage. There seem to be several external HBAs (Dell SC220, Dell MD1200, etc.) that are very reasonably priced.
 The server currently has two SAS Cards flashed to LSI 9211 IT mode with direct passthrough to TrueNas and I have a few PCIe slots open. 
 Are these SAS HBAs compatible with SATA drives that's friendly to ZFS (i.e. has full access to the drives)? I know I'll need to get the cable converters but anything else I should be looking out for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of building my new storage system and planing the power solution.
 After some research (and discovering the fact that psu only provide a fraction of their capacity @ 5v)
 I think i found a solution.
 A year ago corsair officially started offering a 12v to 5v adapters for their psus.
 https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/CORSAIR-%2B5V-Load-Balancer/p/CP-8920275
 If i understand correctly each unit takes one 8pin and provides 20A @ 5v (100w according to their website)
 This bundled with a 1500w psu like the HX1500i (with 9 8pin/pcle & also some 5v directly of the psu),
 might be able to power that amount of drives.
 9 adapter x 20A @ 5v = 180A @ 5v
 + 25A (from psu itselfe) = total of 205A @ 5v.....
 205A should be more than enough for 48 drives even if all would startup at the same time....
 With delayed spinup this should theoretically be able to support more than double that.
 What do you think of this? Did i make a mistake somewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I just got a second server and want to try out proxmox HA (I already use proxmox standalone). Since I'm going to be making a lot of changes to my setup I was wondering what the best way to connect my hard drives to each servers might be. In my first server I have an LSI 9260-4i RAID card with 4 800GB SSDs, combined into 2 virtual 800GB drives via RAID 1. Am I better off skipping the raid card an connecting the drives directly to the 6Gb/s and 3Gb/s sata ports on to mobo?
 Notes
 1) The supermicro motherboard I have doesn't have it's own RAID manager, but I think I can setup zfs or ceph in proxmox?
 2) My servers: SuperServer 5018A-FTN4 , so far the first server was been great for a debian VM, home assisant VM, and a frigate LXC.
 3) I don't have any type of nas ATM.

As someone that is quite new to homelabbing and server usage, I was wondering if anyone either knew anything about these servers, or if anyone has any ideas for decent use cases for them. I picked them up purely out of opportunistic fortune, so I had no use case or anything in mind. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another problem solved by having a managed switch.
 In one part of the house, video calls, sometimes, drop out a tiny bit here and there—in another part of the house, they are fine. Other Internet usage seems fine in the affected part of the house, so how do you resolve this issue? Well, this can be a bit troublesome to troubleshoot, but, in my case, the managed switch helped track down the culprit pretty fast.
 So, like any good tech guy with a homelab, I SSHed into my trusty switch and looked at the statistics for all the interfaces. Unexpectedly, one of the interfaces was communicating at 100Mbps when it should be 1000Mbps! Since my documentation is good, I quickly noticed that port was one of my Wireless Access Points (WAP). The plot thickens!
 Next, I reviewed the counters for that port and, well, lots of errors and drops on that port! Shouldn’t be happening! So, I proceeded to reseat both ends of the CAT6a cable and returned to my SSH session. Same thing. Still negotiating at a lowly 100Mbps.
 I grab a new CAT6a cable (spare cables are a must for a homelab!), swap the cables out and re-return to my SSH session. 1000Mbps is now correctly being negotiated! After verifying I’m connected to this WAP, I proceed to download a large file. Zero errors and drops on this port! Success! I proceed to have a not too long, but not too short, video call and, well, all is well again!
 Last step is to make absolutely certain the affected cable is in the garbage, so it never gets used again!
 Cheers!
 TL;DR: Invest in a managed switch—you get a lot of advanced functionality and it will save you from future frustrating IT episodes!

 I've never owned a supermicro chassis before - generally how loud the chassis and PSU fans are at low load? I've got a chenbro case at that is pretty annoying to listen to even on the lowest fan speeds
 Secondly, I see some of these backplanes come with 1 vs 2 expanders - is this purely for redundancy? Will all of the bays work even with just the 1 expander backplane? (SATA drives if it matters)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Got a new (to me) ASUS server and while I was checking it out I noticed that in the "Server Mgmt" tab of the BIOS the field titled "BMC Self Test Status" and the value is "FAILED".
 https://preview.redd.it/xvs0h0h1bx4a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ae1b515a0cf2140f11d8496b222ceb4afd8d13b
 I checked the manual for the server and on page 66 it says there's an LED on the board called "BMCLED1" which "blinks to indicate that the on-board BMC is functional." However, mine is just a constant and very, very dim green LED (no blinking).
 On page 126 of the manual it shows more options than I have on the "Server Mgmt" tab, including a toggle for "BMC Support" (Enabled/Disabled).
 I tried updating the BIOS to the latest one, but no change (not unexpectedly). Is there anything I can do to try and recover the BMC, or is it toast?
 Would appreciate any input, thanks.
 For reference:
 Server: ASUS RS100-E10-PI2
 Motherboard model: ASUS P11C-M/4L
 BIOS version: 4003 (latest)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I have a couple of servers racked up at home. I'm looking at using server 2 as a mirror of the data on server 1. I have manually copied all of the data over (about 48tb) manually, but keeping them the same is going to be an impossible task to keep up on manually.
 I'm looking for suggestions on what software would best fit my needs for keeping the data backed up/identical. I have enough horsepower that I can create VM's if needed.
 Not sure I'll be able to hit all of these targets, but here is what I'm hoping for: - Scan server 1 and server 2. Copy any missing files from server 1 to server 2. - Ease of use / intuitive. I'm not much the command line guy, but can be taught. Something that is relatively easy to use would be a bonus. - Incremental vs. Differential - which would best fit my needs? - Anything I'm missing? I don't know what I don't know.
 Any guidance would be amazing. This is a whole new realm for me, so all input is greatly appreciated!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used Piwigo for years to host my photos, and I want to move them to AWS where object storage is cheap. There's a piwigo plugin for this, but it's 9 years old and doesn't claim compatibility with any recent release.
 With the widespread use of AWS free tier and also homemade k8s and the like I'd sort-of expected this to be a well-worn problem, but I've scanned the docs for all the self-hosted image galleries I can find and none seem to claim to do this.
 Has anyone got any recommendations for a gallery that does this, or one that has a plugin I've not found? I upload with shotwell and would like to keep that if I can.
 I know I can s3fs it but that feels a bit bodgy and likely to have odd problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just starting out on the journey of replacing my QNAP NAS with a custom build. I want this computer to be on 24/7 so energy efficiency is probably important. I have used the QNAP for plex and as my personal cloud storage. I would like to use it for more but the j1800 is pretty limiting. I like to tinker so home automation, plex, moonlight, some form of ad blocker, Linux iso collections and virtual machines to play around with are all on the list of goals for this next machine.
 I was looking towards a lga 1700 based build and was thinking about a i3 12100t. I want to rack mount this little guy inside a silverstone RM41-H08.
 I want to start off efficient but I'm not sure that the T series chips will be worth starting with if eventually I build this out with 8+ spinning disks and a dGPU and 10gig NIC and all of these other power hungry parts.
 I try to build to use for a decade or even potentially longer. I'm just not sure that i won't want to upgrade the cpu sooner than later.
 I would love to hear about your experiences as well as opinions! 
 Thanks!

 I recently upgraded to 3gbps fibre internet service and wanted to take advantage on my wee homelab so I purchased an ASUS XG-C100C V2 PCIe NIC for $130 CAD. Well I should have done more research because this card has a habit of completely freezing up when under heavy load, requiring a NIC reset to temporarily resolve the issue. There is no updated firmware or drivers available, so I'm returning it and looking for another.
 Any affordable, stable recommendations? The modem/router only has one 10GB Ethernet port. Bonus points for an affordable, stable 10GB switch.

 The drives spin up (I can feel them spinning after disconnecting them)
 I pulled a functioning SATA drive out of the exact same slot that the SAS drive is not working in

Since then I've been migrating services from that "master" LXC into dedicated containers, which was particularly useful for Home Assistant, which is increasingly a total nightmare to run pretty much anywhere outside HAOS. So, HASS, Unifi and Logitech Media Server all live outside that LXC, and they're pretty happy living outside on their own. I don't mind taking the slight hit to memory as I've got plenty in the server.
 But now I'm wondering if I should move nextcloud outside as well. Can folks recommend an approach? Looks like NextCloudPi is one option. Any opinions from others who are in the same sort of proxmox deliberations? Best to give nextcloud it's own pasture, or is it happy grazing alongside the general rabble of sonarr, radarr, etc etc

 I have a nginx webserver to access some services from outside my home network. I have a Wireguard server to access some services that are not exposed via webserver. When I'm not connected to the wireguard server, I can access the webserver exposed services without any errors.
 The problem I am having is when my phone (wireguard client) is connected to the wireguard server and tries to access the webserver services (https://app.domain.tld), it keeps giving an `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error and message that says "Your connection is not private". 
 However, while connected to the wireguard server, my client is able to access internet and LAN services using hostname:port (http://192.168.1.6:3030). 
 I am not sure why this is case. Oddly enough, I am able to access my webserver services from within my LAN as long as i am not connected to the wireguard server.
 ​
 Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. It is quite annoying to having to connect/disconnect to my wireguard vpn server in order to access different services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me a moment, this one's a little complicated, but I'd really appreciate some assistance from anyone more experienced with these drives than myself.
 I bought two 16TB WD Elements drives during a Black Friday sale and subsequently shucked them after testing them via USB. I removed the 3.3v pins (third from the left, etc, done this before on other models) on both, but one of the drives still doesn't want to come alive when plugged in unless I'm using the USB board supplied with the drive enclosure. The drive works, just only when using the enclosure's board.
 The machine I would like to use this drive on is a NAS enclosure with a SATA backplane, so I can't use a molex adapter to get around the usual 3.3v issue. If I'm not able to get anywhere otherwise, I plan to try swapping the drives between machines, but would like to avoid this if possible as it would require (another) array parity rebuild.
 Both drives report as WD160EDGZ-11B2DA0. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Here's a picture of the SATA connector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have two of the US dub of the 1980s Mr. Men and Little Miss VHS tapes I have since getting into the series back in 2008 and a Anpanman tape that has 3 episodes that aren't on DVD. My brother knows how to record the tapes and digitize them. But there's a few problems. One is that our VCR is a Magnavox VCR/DVD combo GDV228MG9 , and that the tapes can sometimes jump. And if that happens, it messed up the recording.
 My brother researched that we should invest on another VCR player that is S-VHS. But he also told me that we should also look into a VCR with a time base corrector. The major roadblock is that they are too much to buy. And while trying to not spend the money on foolish things is a step, it'll still take a long to achieve that. Not only that, I don't know how long the tapes will last, especially since the Mr. Men ones are in their mid 30s. And I can't just simply buy another copy of the tapes as they aren't on ebay anymore. And I don't know anybody that has the best equipment that can actually digitized the tapes. I did had one friend years ago who helped me with a recorded Thomas tape, but I don't know if he still does it.

 Intel OPTANE H10 16GB + 256GB SSD M.2 is selling on eBay for $30; is that good compared to a 500GB WD Blue SN570 NVMe for $40. What advantages to Optane add?
 I posted in HomeLab because I intend to use 2 of these for a mirrored proxmox boot drive, but I do tend to reuse hardware for new projects often so getting a good value, even if it's overkill for this use case, is still good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my first ever Reddit post so apologies I'm if doing Reddit wrong :P. I have gone through a number of recommendations on this subreddit but run into trouble after installing with it not having features etc. It also seems as though the list of active projects is constantly in flux.
 I have 1TB of photos currently synced via OneDrive. They are organized by year/month and have tags of names and star ratings. Unfortunately, the Onedrive backend is slow (especially for 4k video) and is limited in features. My dream would be to have a shared self-hosted lightroom replacement but my realistic workflow is to use lightroom for editing and then have a full-library export that will be viewable by family members online. I was wondering if ya'll could give me a recommendation. Here is what I am looking for:
 Minimum:
  
Navigate images/videos by folder structure
 Authentication (would be great if you could use google for the login flow and just save a list of permitted email addresses).
 Searchable, including keywords and star ratings
 A nice interface that will get the stamp of approval from the lady
 Web interface
 Feature complete or actively updated
 Free OR a perpetual license (no subscriptions!)
  
Really want:
  
Transcoding to stream 4k videos over 5mbps up data pipe (hardware transcoding preferred). I have an AMD cpu and graphics card.
 Search includes things automatically identified in the images (beach, tree, ball - nothing crazy). Facial recognition could be nice too.
  
Nice to Have
  
Map view
 Be able to work on the main database:
 Phone upload (android and ios)
 Can view Canon raw files (Canon R7 and old EOS images) - could just be the preview thumbnail
 Can view .heif files
 The source of truth is the file system - Any modifications made in the UI (keywords, captions, rating) are stored in the file itself (not an app database)

 Our main services run on a Synology NAS, HomeAssistant on a NUC, PiHole (for local DNS too) and NPM on 2 different RasPis and all that goes through a ASUS Router with Merlin Firmware.
 I'm exposing the Ports on NPM so I can access Bitwarden and HomeAssistant, other services like Plex do it on their own (UPNP?).
 Any general advice I could follow? I wanted to use Cloudflare tunnels with Google auth, but it seems anyone with Google auth could log in there, lol...? didn't seem to be whitelist-able? But that has the downside of not being able to use Bitwarden. 
 Maybe I have a fundamental misunderstanding on those things. Since I plan on re-doing my networking soon I thought I ask now :) Thanks for any advice.

 I'm looking to expand my homelab out to the cloud, namely in order to have off-site backup capabilities. I want to continue to manage my own services, so Backblaze, while superb, isn't something I want to pursue for this (though, I do use Backblaze to backup the computer I'm currently sitting at).
 Can anyone direct me to the absolute cheapest VPS provider you can find? Number of cores is unimportant, nor is RAM. The biggest criteria is cheap storage. To do that, I'm 100% fine with using legacy spinning storage rather than SSD's and NVMe.
 Ideally, looking for a VM with 1-2 TB of storage in the $10-15 range. I don't know if that's too optimistic.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a 2tb m2 SSD that has been running a bit hot in his computer for a few years now. We had a scare once when I wouldn't mount properly on boot, causing him to think he lost the last 27 years of photos and random internet forum backups that he has stored on me, but one reboot later, he found me again. It gave him a little bit of a scare, so he found another one of me (THE AUDACITY to think he could find another ME) and stuck us together into RAID0. 
 Lemme tell you what, this man was ESTATIC to find out that he had double the storage, while still having the protection of RAID. He went on an unhinged downloading spree, grabbing everything he could find online he thought was rare and people might want one day. Random things like old MTV shows, a live action Spirited Away play (ITS ALREADY A MOVIE, WHO NEEDS A PLAY?), and technical manuals for old hardware (?????????).
 Anyways, it was a lot. The heat and pressure to deliver finally was enough for me, and I said 'Peace, Im out'. 
 Well, turns out he didn't like that, and started breaking things. I tried to get away, but he grabbed me before I could and said he was going to take me to a 'specialist' to get 'fixed'. Like, I don't need fixing – Ive made my choice. He kept claiming I was so valuable and he needed me, but then decided to treat me like that? Without any backups??? Clearly I wasn't that important to him. Regardless of my decisions, he hauled me down to a data specialist to recover some stuff, but they couldn't do anything. 
 So reddit, AITA for dying to teach him about backups and that RAID0 is not a backup?

I have been using TeamViewer for years to access my headless servers, but yesterday evening it decided to think I was using it for commercial purposes. I called support and filled out the form and everything, but I am basically screwed until they reinstate my free account.
 As soon as they reinstate my free account, the first thing I am doing is switch to another Remote Desktop service. Any recommendations? I have wanted to switch to something selfhosted for a while now, but I avoided it because I need to be able to remote into computers even when the selfhosted VM might now be working. Since a Remote Desktop service is so important to have always working for me, I would really like a cloud service, but I don’t know if any that offer the same features as TeamViewer for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, usually on my servers I configure msmtp with an external free mail service provider to send e-mail notifications to myself. But this has one limitation. I can only send from the registered e-mail address (eg. secretname@provider.com) because everything else (eg. secretname@mydomain.com) wouldn't be allowed by that specific mail provider.
 This isn't a problem when I'm sending notifications to myself, but some self hosted services rely on e-mail. For example Gitea "anonymizes" emails like github does. So it gives users mail addresses like skdfhskdjf@noreply.my-gitea-instance.de
 This is a feature that I can't use with above limitations. Now I am searching for a better solution where I can send e-mails from my own domain or whatever else.
 Should I host a very basic (sending only) mail server myself? Or should I register somewhere, where I can create unlimited e-mail accounts for my own domain and still use the msmtp route?
 The last one seems difficult because I already use that domain for my private e-mail. So in that domain's DNS is already the MX records of my mail provider. Which doesn't allow multiple accounts etc. I'm not sure if I can set MX records of another provider on the same domain... PS: I don't want to switch away from my existing mail provider.
 What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi homelab community!
 I am planning to move parts of my homelab infrastructure from my local server to a VPS provider (like linode, aws, azure, ...)At least I want move applications that should be accessible from the web.e.g. my private homepage, a small community website, a small application that i created for my business.
 I plan to use NGINX proxy manager to enforce and handle SSL and authelia for 2FA.
 My preferred option would be to separate the infrastructure from the webserver.But with that my question is:"How to prevent direct access to the webserver and basically skipping nginx and authelai like shown in the picture below for client 3?"
 Option1
 As i do have full access to the VPS via SSH I could of course also install docker on Virtual Server2 and handle NGINX and Authelia on the same server to make things way easier:
 Option 2
 But I think the solution to keep the infrastructure topics separated from the webserver seems way cleaner to me as i am also planning to futher lockdown with e.g. geoblocking, cloudflare, and so on.
 Any help/thoughts/suggestions or votes for option 1 or 2 would be highly appreciated.
 thanks and have a nice weekend,mike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just recently started to self host, i have a raspberry pi running nextcloud and i got an awesome rush out of setting it all up, i don't have a public IP so i even had to setup an ssh tunnel between an oracle VPS and the RPI to enable access everywhere.
 Anyways, i want to keep playing with selfhosted services but I ran out of VPS and i want to get a PC i can use as a home server to play with.
 I found a good deal for the M900 tiny and i plan to install Ubuntu on it and play with virtual machines on it. 
 I'm completely amateur, i don't have any formal IT training but i do know a bit about networking, web development, python programming and I know fairly well my way around Linux although I'm far from a sysadmin. 
 So I would like to ask for advice regarding if this computer is a good place to start my home lab. I don't have a much of a budget.
 These are kind of services would I like to run off the computer in the VMs I'd set up: -mail in a box -adguard -plex -mysql -mongo -some websites -many discord bots 
 I wouldn't run all, and definitely not at the same time. They're just examples.
 So is this computer good for me? Should I look for something else? What are your recommendations?
 Edit: Thanks everyone for answering, I just order it. I'll try to run everything on docker containers to use the most out of the pc. I'll be updating how it goes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been setting up wired network runs at home, and decided to use CAT6, since it's rated for 10G up to 55m, which is well above what I needed. The main network rack is in the garage, and I ran four CAT6 cables from the "server closet" on the second story, each about 75ft/23m.
 I have an old storage server (Supermicro SuperStorage 6048R-E1CR24L) with dual Intel X540 NICs. I patched it through to the Mikrotik CRS312 switch, but it only auto-negotiated at 1G. I saw in Winbox that "10G" would flash for a brief moment under the list of peer advertised speeds, but it would never stick.
 My server runs SmartOS, an Illumos/Solaris derivative. I searched around to see if anyone else had issues getting 10G working on X540 NICs, and tried some of the suggestions, but nothing has worked so far. I brought the server down to the garage and connected it with a short CAT6 cable, and voila, it negotiated 10G with no problem. I haven't tried another OS yet to see if that might make it work.
 Long-term, though, I don't want to keep the server in the garage, especially come spring and summer. So, long story short, I'm wondering if anyone else has had issues with X540 NICs not being able to negotiate 10G speeds at distances within the CAT6 spec?
 For contrast, I have a Mac Studio in the room with the "server closet," and it negotiates 10G. I tested the speeds with iperf3 between it and the storage server, and it can get ~9.35G one-way. So I don't think there's any interference that would explain this behavior. Although when I run with --bidir, the bandwidth drops to 7.97G and 5.97G; could this indicate something is wrong with the runs, terminations, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. An old NUC 5i5RYH 1.6GHz w/ 8GB of RAM serves as my main desktop PC running Windows 10 Pro in my study. I really don't expect much from it, just browsing the web and running MS Office-type programs. No games, minimal video. It works as a home computer.
 I have an HPE Proliant Microserver Gen 10 Plus with a Xeon E-2444 3.4GHz w/ 32GB of RAM running Windows Server Standard 2019 with the Windows Server Essentials Experience added. It's basically a file server but I also run a couple of programs remotely using a Remote Desktop app as a poor man's VMWare type arrangement. Other than my internet upload connection being slow when accessing it remotely, it works well.
 I'm considering building a VM with Windows 10 Pro using Hyper-V as replacement for the old NUC. I can add audio support by way of the server's PCIe gen3 x16 slot and dedicate a network port to the VM. Other than the NUC supporting hyperthreading, it seems to me that the VM would be better. It would also get rid of some unnecessary older hardware. Also, since I'm running the server, anyway, it would reduce power consumption.
 When I posted this same question on the s\intelnuc, I was advised to inquire here.
 Suggestions? Critique? If this would work without constant maintenance (other than normal software updates) can you recommend a video/sound card? The slot is PCI-E 3.0 x16, low profile, mounted horizontally on a daughter board.

What kind of latency should I look for from DNS? My closest VPS location is Vultr in Seattle which averages about 16-18MS most of the time.
 Are there security implications of hosting a DNS server on the public internet?
  
Never done this before but being able to use it on the go without a VPN sounds nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking to purchase either a system containing an i5-6500T or an i5-4790T. They perform similarly, with around a 20% improvement for the newer chip, however the i5-4790T PC that I can purchase has 1x8gb DDR3, compared to the 1x4gb DDR4 in the i5-6500T PC - giving the older chip PC more upgradability on a budget. 
 ​
 The only other reason that I can see for preferring the newer chip is that its integrated graphics can be better passed through to multiple VMs (How useful is GVT-g?), however I am unsure as to how competent the 4th Gen i5 would be for simple video playback in a VM. 
 ​
 Which option would be superior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered a strange DNS issue with one machine on my home network. From all of my testing in troubleshooting, I am left with the conclusion that the endpoint protection suite (Carbon Black) is tampering with and replacing my DNS results. Let me explain.
 Over the weekend I added pihole to my network in a high availability cluster using keepalived. This essentially creates a virtual IP on my network that can point to any one of 3 machines, depending on their status. On my network, this virtual IP is 192.168.50.30, and I have configured my router to use it for DNS. Testing this on my main Windows 11 machine, and several other Ubuntu and Debian VMs, it works wonderfully without issue.
 My work machine is a different story however. My domain name, lets call it xyz.house is registered with cloudflare. In pihole, I added an A record for pihole.local to 192.168.50.30, and then a CNAME for pihole.internal.xyz.house pointing to pihole.local. When making DNS requests, the local hostname pihole.internal.xyz.house fails to resolve in a very strange way. At least I thought I wasn't resolving because only the hostname was returned; no IP. Then I realized this was only happening hostnames that actually exist externally of pihole. Once I realized this, I tried other domains. Adding google.com as a local A record in pihole, which was likewise ignored. It seemed that my work machine ignores my local DNS results when the hostname is a real hostname registered somewhere else. As if the endpoint protection is trying to avoid DNS spoofing/poisoning. I also realized that the reason I didn't get an IP response, is because there wasn't an A record listed for xyz.house or pihole.internal.xyz.house in cloudflare.
 Has anyone ever heard of this?

 I'm fairly new to datahoarding so if I make any mistakes please let me know.
 I have recently purchased a brand-new 4TB Seagate Barracuda HDD off of Amazon, and it arrived fine. There was no visible damage to the box, and it was firmly strapped onto some sort of carboard frame inside.
 I ran multiple tests on it to check for errors with 2 programs (StableBit Scanner and HD Tune Pro), and both of them showed the drive as completely clean.
 However, I found that it makes a really faint rattling (and sometimes more scratchy) noise. The sound is more common in the first 1.5 billion sectors or so, and gets less common and quieter near the end of the disk. 
 Is the disk fine? Should I RMA it immediately?
 (Also, either the SMART data is really weird or I just don't know how to interpret it properly could someone help)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed homer and just finished adding all of my groups and apps to it. I'm using the 
 background-image: "/assets/tools/image.png" 
 command so that I can add my desired picture. I saw in the documentation on github that you can create custom configurations. I tried looking up how to do this since the yml file is in html I believe. I tried using the things listed such as 
 background-size: background-position: 
 but these did not help with anything. I'm new to editing scripts like this and am looking for some guidance. I'd like position the picture in the center of my screen instead of it automatically enlarging itself. I would also like to add an image to the header since I saw that was possible in one of the custom configs. Would I need to create a new yml file or can I edit this into my current one?

 I'd either put my own components in, or if it's a DAS box, get a new HBA and build a NAS in a cheap 2U Rosewill case.
 I don't want to use something like a Dell R730xd and do an all in one because of the high fan noise.
 I was thinking a Dell power vault off of FleaBay or something similar, but I'm not sure how loud they are. 
 Any suggestions? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is my cluster under Proxmox VE based on Dell Optiplex 9020 Micro in socket 1150 (Intel 4th gen) which are the last models to accept Xeon processors, which makes them more affordable than the following generations.
 The good points are :
 - Power consumption (15-20 watts on average),
 - Intel vt-d instructions to do passthrough with Linux virtual machines (desktop instance, kodi, batocera) or to do transcoding with Plex/Jellyfin,
 - Very quiet,
 - Low power multi-core processors with hyper-threading (score of 5449 for the i7-4785t and 6168 for the E3-1265l v3 on cpubench) that allow to run several virtual machines without flinching,
 Specifications
 - CPU : two models in i7-4785t (4c/8t, 2,2 Ghz, 35 watts) and one in E3-1265l v3 (4c/8t, 2,5 Ghz, 45 watts),
 - Memory: 8 GB DDR3 (up to 16 GB maximum),
 - 256 GB SSD,
 ​
 I got all three for just over 300 euros. At the moment, the E3-1265l v3 is at 33 dollars on Aliexpress (6168 pts on cpubench) so for those who want to make a HomeLab for cheap, the TinyMiniMicro in socket 1150 have the best value for money because above, the Xeon processors do not work anymore and the price is much higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr Is looking at source code the best way to rip these days?
 I've been using VLC for youtube but many of the instructions on how to do so, are now outdated. Obviously youtube tries to stop this sort of stuff so I've used a couple different versions of this method over the years with moderate success. The other thing I've tried is chrome extensions which again, may work for a period of time but ultimately get blocked. Many of the times, the higher quality versions I've never been able to download. It seems like the VLC method maxed out at 720p/1080p. I'd really like to be able to save content from youtube and others in the max quality possible.
 I think the best way from here is to examine the code which has worked for me in the past (5-10+ years) when code was a little more straightforward, but finding the actual content is "wrapped" (sorry I don't code) in java(?). I'd like to learn enough to squirrel this stuff out myself, any suggestions - or does a website's media player query things to an outside source to pull content? 
 Right now, I'd like to rip this content and three extensions fail to even find the audio or video. Side rant: anyone come up with a solution to save images as jpeg/png that are displayed as .webp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently purchased a 14TB Seagate Exos and it's one of the quietest drives I've ever owned. The only quieter drive I've owned was a consumer 4TB 5400 RPM SMR drive which was dead silent.
 I've owned a 150GB WD Raptor that sounded like a sewing machine it was so loud.
 In 2009 I also purchased the first 1TB WD Black drive which wasn't nearly as loud but still noisy. I was expecting the drive to be as loud as that WD Black but it's silent in comparison even after writing several TB to it already. 
 At least for Seagate helium filled drives they are silent compared to consumer drives from just a decade ago.
 At first I thought it was louder than it actually was because it was resonating against my case but I simply added some foam pads and it's silent now, I'm amazed. The only time I can tell the drive is on is from the very occasional clicks I consider normal from any spinning hard disk. Am I alone in this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I have recorded manny records from my vinyls to MP3 files. Sometimes I have problems to find the right music to prepare my mix with my dj controller. So I want to tag my mp3s, like in paperless DMS. For example: Feral - Medium #techno #deep #key:minor #intro
 I would like to search the tracks and create a tracklist and later download the mp3 files.
 It sounds a little complicated, it probably is, but I can't remember any artistic names to search the tracks. For me it's by feel and this feel I would like to write in tags. If there is such a thing I would be happy if you can tell me such a web application. If you are DJs yourselves and you have a better idea, then I would be happy about advice and ideas.

 I couldnt find a definitiv answer for this. Ill make it real simple
 I want to host games and servers for a community where complete strangers have access, aswell as its a little bit of a shady one. So the chances of a hacking attack is increased.
 I have read that hamachi basically cuts out the protection you would usually have with a firewall and the internet. So im assuming that a attack becomes much more sucessfull.
 Do any of the virtual network programs guarantee security from hackers, or are there ways to make it secure.
 ​
 thanks in advance for help

 I have a Proxmox host running two VMs. One is Ubuntu Server and another is Windows Server 2022. The Ubuntu VM is a docker host with a Microsoft SQL Server container running on it. Here is the docker-compose.yml I used: 
 version: "3.2" services: mssql: image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest' container_name: orion_db hostname: sql1 ports: - '1433:1433' environment: - ACCEPT_EULA=Y - SA_PASSWORD=<insertpassword> volumes: - '/.drive:/var/opt/mssql' 
 Both VMs are on the same subnet with a firewall rule for the Ubuntu VM to explicitly allow connections from the Windows Server VM over ports 1433 and 1434. The DB server has also been configured to allow outbound connections through the CLI.
 However, when launching Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on the Windows Server VM, I am only able to see the databases running on the Windows Server VM, even when selecting "Network Servers". Is there a step I missed or did I misconfigure something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently built a new tool to do some devops work in my home lab, which was initially intended to be a more "advanced" exec handler for serf so I could more effectively change backend vm's of my custom load balancer among other things. What I quickly realized was that it was way simpler and easier to use than ansible / chef etc, especially for golang apps where I just needed to drop a binary set up a user and create a systemd unit file with a template, then start the service on an lxc container.
 Some of the key things that make it useful for me is to secure bootstrap of new instances (cloud init) or (golden images), as I can dynamically provision based on instance id/hostname/ip which is locked to particular s3 prefix(or minio), which means I don't need any external inbound requests to the server to provision at all and changing install is as simple as just terminating instance / updating s3 config. It does still function well for serf too though as an exec handler and I now use it as both os installer and exec handler, that first sets up nginx but also can take the members in the serf role and quickly update nginx config + HUP nginx with new members as example.
 The templating uses go templates but variable injection can be done either by providing a preset value or by running a command inline, so you can use hostname -f of the live system to feed a template var. Second to that I built in os limits, so in the same file you can run 2 cmd executions but limit one to ubuntu or specifically ubuntu:20.04 and the other for redhat... This was required for things like installing bind tools which has different package names between the OS's 
 Right now there is an nginx install example but I might create a simple one for home assistant and magic mirror etc, with module updates.
 Either way would love some feedback: https://github.com/Nitecon/bruce

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been the happy owner of a PowerEdge T20, that I bought for a bargain price many years ago (2015?).
 It's served me very well, but I'm starting to think it wouldn't hurt to spend a bit of money and get it a bit more up-to-date on the power front. It would be fine for me to keep the body of the thing, but I would've thought I could upgrade the motherboard and chip, possibly power supply. However, I'm not at all a PC build expert, so don't have much of an idea what the best deals are.
 I'd be looking for excellent bang-for-buck, that should be significantly better than what I already have, but for minimal cost. The thing cost me only something like €250 when I got it, after all.
 Specs:
  
Motherboard Dell VD5HY: https://www.itcreations.com/product/84192
 CPU: Xeon(R) CPU E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz 
 Having Intel QuickSync for Plex seems to be quite desirable?
 
 Currently 16GB ram. Would be nice to be able to increase that, with good value chips
  
Hope someone with better skills can advise!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,i'm getting a little frustrated trying to find a to-do app with kanban-view. There are some cool approaches on the market - but they are never thought through to the end.
 What do I need?
  
Multiple listview (= Categories) for managing
  
 Tasks
 Subtasks
 Recurring-Tasks
 Due-Dates
 Priority
  
 Kanban-View for drag & drop between stages (Backlog, Planned, This Week, Today, Done)
 Mobile-Support for
  
 Creating new tasks
 Push-Notifications (Due-Dates)
  
Nice to have
  
Time Tracking
 Kanban with Swimlanes (e.g. List-Categories as Swimlanes)
 Additional Labels, Search-Function, etc.
  
What I tried:
  
Focalboard -> Nice Web UI, but not mobile-friendly (e.g. Reminder / Push), no recurring tasks
 Nextcloud -> No recurring tasks, buggy combination with Deck for Kanban
 Vikunja -> CalDAV-Sync is great, but it's not supporting Subtask-Sync and Recurring-Task-Sync
  
My dream would be a Vikunja with better Subtask-Creation (it's a pain doing this via UI) and CalDAV implementation, that I could use in combination with Tasks.org Android App with full features (recurring and subtasks) ...
 Any alternative on the market?

 Did you think about making a time capsule filled with data ?
 I'm talking in short term like 5 years of USB flash drive holding data. Home environment VS out doors ?
 Also did you ever think about making a time capsule that would hold its data for 100s of years ?
 With all the stuff lost this can be crucial in the future.
 For example the movie Nosferatu was literally ordered to be destroyed because of copyright violations it did.
 WE have it now because some tapes survived and now everything of that time is public domain so it is not a problem and a cultural treasure.

 I can personally get by with PWAs, but I vastly prefer having native applications, especially for services my partner also uses. As an iOS user I’m also kind of jealous of all of you in Android land, because that (unsurprisingly) seems to be the main focus for native apps for self hosted services.
 Also, what are some projects with nice mobile apps?

It seems like both sides of the tape were filled, and most of it is callers calling in to talk to Al Stanek, including my uncle who knew him. I'm pretty sure this isn't some "crazy lost history" type recording, but are there still archiving groups interested in any recording they can get their hands on? If so, please point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a decade I was worried about my not backed up pictures which were on an external drive, so I went to back them up and the drive failed. Or so I thought. Repeated attempts to get the drive to spin up just resulted in a clicking head and nothing. So I put it in a drawer to eventually take to a data recovery service when I could afford it. 
 Time passes, and yesterday I was doing some file management of newer pictures which needed to happen (In addition to backing them up) when I got a wild hair to plug the drive in to see what would happen. Low and behold, it spins up....sort of. Same head skipping/stalling issue. The difference this time is I can see the files and am able to copy some, for a few seconds till it freezes. 
 Windows file transfer sucks for this so I try TeraCopy, pausing the transfer when it freezes, unplugging the drive, plugging it back in and starting the transfer over. This works...sort of. For whatever reason it only recognized about a third of the files this way. 
 So I try again, and this time it works flawlessly without any head issues throughout the entire transfer. I saved about 130GB worth of pictures from a fairly formative time in my life sort of by accident. Now I'm sorting them properly and backing up multiple copies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I got myself NAS to upgrade my HomeLab and want fix problems with current setup. First I'll describe my setup and issues with it because I may be approaching it completely wrong and missing obvious easy solution
 Current setup
  
VPS with static public IPv4
 RPI4 with 1x SSD for data
 Synology DS920+ (new, reason why I'm trying to upgrade my setup)
  
My home is behind CGNAT so I have VPS with NPM.. VPS is sending traffic to RPI4 trough ZeroTier to bypass CGNAT
 Problem with current setup
  
all traffic to my services like NextCloud is routed trough VPS and is HEAVILY bottle-necked by my slow internet
  
new setup i want to achieve
  
be able to access local services trough domain at local speeds 
 I want to add services like Jellyfin and be able to access them trough my domain (jellyfin.example.com) regardless of me being at home or not and when I'm at home not be bottlenecked by my internet.
 
  
Solution i thought of
  
run reverse-proxy at home
 use adguard's dns rewrite to send requests to my domain directly to reverse-proxy at home instead to my VPS and be bottlenecked by my internet
 redirect port 80 & 443 from my VPS to server at home
  
First I wanted to use "streams" in NPM but it didn't work for ports 80 & 443 (of course it didn't) Then I tried to achieve this setup with 'socat' but NPM failed to get SSL cert
 If someone doesn't know, NPM is NginxProxyManager
 info that may matter
  
I want to learn traefic and upgrade to it after I get this working, using NPM for now because of the ease of setup 
 if traefic will make my desired setup easier I'll go for it straight away

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - if there is a better sub for this please let me know.
 I purchased a domain for a business idea a bit ago, things took longer to get going than I anticipated. Nothing was hosted on it yet, but it is the name I would like to launch this business under.
 I forgot (stupidly) to renew my domain. It expired at the end of September. It is currently in the "redemption period." My registrar was Namecheap. They said I could get it out of redemption for about $100 (I forget the exact amount) or that if I just waited eventually it would be released *as long as nobody buys it at the auction.* My initial plan was to just wait it out, and I should be getting close to the time where it is released per Namecheap's associate... Today, the Whois is still saying Namecheap redemption period.
 But I was thinking today, where is this auction? I can't seem to find anything with google. There shouldn't basically any value to this website (I did have content on it like 10 years ago but that has long since been taken down), but I don't really want to lose it to someone who might get it at an auction because I'm being cheap. So, if I could just go to the auction and win it there...wouldn't that work?
 I'm a little over my head in this one and appreciate any help. Thanks!

I got the refurbs from Amazon and ran badblocks on them, took nearly 2 weeks to finish four complete block by block write/read's but they all come back clean. So my plan is to buy one each month, so that by end of 2023 I will have 15 of them. three replicas x five 200tb units. So a total of 3PB with one PB of addressable storage. 
 As for the individual units, suggestions? I was going to just go with straight Raid-0 or JBOD setting. I am still learning how ADM works but I love how I could use these units to also host docker and they could play host to some container services. 
 Other concerns I need to work out are power, brown outs in winter and summer are not uncommon, but also the networking. These units can take up to 10gb for it's primary connector and I'd love to have all 15 for purposes of replication but if it's too pricey I can live with a 1gb switch instead. 
 Suggestions?

 ​
 It is, however, a little annoying to get a development cluster up and running to play with, so I wanted to share a *very* simplified set of ansible scripts for folks to get started with, quickly, because it's fantastic.
 ​
 If you're unfamiliar with the Hashicorp Stack, I put together a very brief write-up on its major components (Consul, Vault, Nomad), along with a repo with some ansible scripts and a Vagrant file for y'all to play around with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, since 1997, I've pretty much deleted nothing and have had multiple drive failures & recoveries. Anyway, now I have a file server (Windows Server 2019) that all these files have been dumped onto with no organization whatsoever (since with some of the drive failures, the folder structures were lost).
 I have anywhere between 3-6 copies of the same file as they existed on multiple drives. Is there any file deduplication software that can look through all these files, pick the non-corrupt ones (yes, I have those too) and place them elsewhere? We're talking close to 10+ million files.

 I am planning out networking/homeserver stuff for a new apartment, I have quite a bit of freedom and I already know what my use cases are, but want to do it right.
 Right now I have fiber coming into my apartment and I have the below setup working great for me:
  
generic ASUS router running openWRT
 1 managed switch (need VLANs)
 1 intel Nuc with Ubuntu acting as media PC / home server connected to a TV over HDMI.
  
The NUC has some file shares (few TB in external hard drives) to be accessed locally/over VPN, has Steam for streaming games from a PC (once a month max), Kodi (pretty much replaced by Jellyfin now) and a bunch of containers on it:

It would also be nice if it was capable of monitoring URL’s and taking a screenshot if the URL changes. I am also looking for software or an extension that is capable of retrieving images in the original resolution from multiple URLs. Something similar to Image Picka but capable of retaining the original resolution.
 Any information regarding these matters would greatly be appreciated, thanks.

 Not exactly the question for this sub, but you folks know everything AND Dell Optiplex desktops are quite popular among homelab enthusiasts...
 Long story short - I have several Dell Optiplex desktops I bought off DellRefurbished and ebay over the last 3-4 years, ranging from i5-4590 to i5-8500. Most serve some specific purpose (e.g. a BlueIris surveillance server), others just act as a "regular" PC I often RDP to on a daily basis from my work laptop. 
 Most of the time I would try to buy the desktop with Pro version of the OS (W10 pro, W7 pro), but it looks like I made a mistake once and bought one W10 Home machine. I can live with most limitations, except for the lack of RDP server functionality. 
 I tried rdpwrap on that machine and it usually works for a while, but Microsoft …]]></summary>

I had been using the Plexamp cast function and chromecasting from PodcastAddict on my regular phone to the stereo-phone when needed. I really like that with Plexamp I can use the "cast" menu to remotely control play/pause and volume as well as queuing up playlists etc, and I wanted that for podcast playback as well. I got some of that (play/pause and volume) on my desktop and other devices via KDE Connect, but not the ability to choose what's playing. Podcast Addict living on my phone also means that I don't have a way to maintain local copies, progress, and play history aside from the app's own backup and OPML exports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to setup VLANs on my network and make sure it's correctly configured and secured so that things like for example VLAN Hopping are not possible and so on. I already know the whole concept of VLANs but I'm not quite sure about implementing it which is why I made this post. So, from my research online it shows that I need to:
 For Wireless:
 Create multiple SSIDs with VLAN IDs on them then mark a port as Trunk on the switch with all the VLAN IDs that were assigned to SSIDs. At the end just plug in the Wireless Access Point to that specific trunk port on the switch. Of course, the main appliance that acts as a router\firewall needs to have set VLANs in its configuration as well.
 For LAN:
 For the LAN I just configure a VLAN ID and a port on the switch itself to which I then plug a RJ45 cable into. Also, the router\firewall appliance has its own configuration for LAN VLANs.
 Is this how I should go about setting up VLANs or am I missing something here ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The TP link has more than enough power for my needs , likely less power hungry, newer, and easier to configure but $100 and I'll have to source or make mounting ears. The Juniper can be had for around $60 with ears included, but likely way harder to configure for a n00b like me. My requirements are 16 port (8x PoE+ 30w) gigabit, rack mountable, not crazy power hungry (under 50w not including PoE)
 Are the extra ports and power consumption that I likely won't need worth the cost savings and configuration difficulty? I have only managed switches through GUI before.

I've looked around on ebay and other similar used sites, but have come up with wildly high prices. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am using the server for a plex library so I can further cut ties with streaming services.
 Edit I should mention I am in Canada, so the prices are super inflated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I am kindda lost on all the small form factors PC around. Dell Optiplex, HP elitedesk, lenovo mxxx... 
 I'd like to build a simple router on a small PC, obviously it will need at least two NIC. 
 Someone from here showed me the Lenovo M720q, which can handle a i350 4x NIC on a PCIe entry. But currently I only find some pricey ones, and the i350 mod also costs a little. Around +300€ in total, not really worth it for a no wifi router (i'll think about getting a wifi access point later on).
 It's hard to say if other brands can do the same, they do have optional rear ports (vga / hdmi / rs232), but i'm not sure those places could host a NIC from there. I'm thinking of some Dell Optiplex, actually I can get a 3070 for a decent price but without this multi NIC capability i'm not motivated to buy it. It does have a empty "cross" at the back (if no optional port there) but I really don't know how to profit from it. 
 Has some of you used a small factor PC to turn into a multi NIC router ? If yes could you point me some models, tips or anything of help. 
 Thanks a lot !

 I was wondering what solutions you guys are implementing to keep digitised versions of important documents. 
 I think I've outgrown my basic folder structure and wanted something that could replace it. 
 I don't have any significant requirements, though I would prefer that files are stored as files and not in a database, for ease of retrieval in case something goes wrong.

 Like announced in the title, I am not an expert in these matters...
 That being said, I have a big house (3 floors) that will need renovating. I wanted to find a spot where to put the incoming fibre connexion, a 4 bay Synology NAS with media and personal backup, probably a second one for video surveillance, and a switch that would be linked to several ethernet plugs in the house (likely 8+).
 There's a small room below the stairs where this could fit well. But apart from a small door, there is of course no window in there.
 Is that a problem? Any recommendations for what I'd like to achieve?
 Thank you very much!

 DL380 G9 12x LFF, 2x 2667v4, 256GB RAM + iodrives in PCIe Slots
  
Storage:
  
DL380 G9 12x LFF, 2x 2650v4, 192GB RAM (Fully filled with WD Golds)
 MSA 2040 12x LFF filled with some shucked and some wd drives
  
​
 currently i run some minor vm's and the main debian zfs vm on the dl380g9(storage)
 i got esxi installed and im passing through the controllers needed to see my disks in the vm directly
 ​
 Current options:
 A: Selfbuild new Server with an SM or Chenbro case (24/36x LFF) and either barebone debian or passthrough with controller again
 B: used SAN like the 3par 8000 and giving it an vm on the compute cluster
 ​
 Main concern is future upgrades and power as im currently at 0,83€ per kw/h also soonish switching from vmware to xen or proxmox whatever fits me better after testing
 ​
 may the hoarding help!

 I want to see busy times on each of these calendars based on meetings/events on the other calendars. Preferably something selfhosted/opensource
 potentially something that I can connect all calendars to and automatically update it across them. I.e. New calendar event on google calendar 1 means add busy block on all the others.
 I am not looking something like calendly that will create a link to show available times. if it does the above and also provide a link that would be okay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have Windows 10 and for the longest time I've wanted to know if there's anything I can do differently or better to maintain my drives. I have mixed SATA SSDs, NVMes and HDDs, 12 total.
 I know Windows does TRIM on SSDs, but I don't know...there's something satisfying about running a command or a maintenance cycle that I can see working and see the results of, if you know what I mean.
 Do you run maintenance on your drives regularly? Any recommendations of what I can do to keep them running well? Lastly, do you set Windows to turn off your drives after X amount of minutes in power options, and do you use hibernate? Does hibernate harm SSDs with the writes?

 I'm simply using a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB with an 2TB external HDD for all of my self hosted stuff. I'm pretty happy with it but I'm curious what equipment other people are using and why they have what they have. I've been using my setup for several months now and I love it. I was considering sinking some more money into a more professional setup like a rack of some kind and a little more horsepower for game servers and whatnot.
 What equipment do you have?

Some of the equipment was labeled with Engineering Sample stickers stating that they could not be sold, so I was able to get some presumably research equipment for free... but I have no idea what these are other than yes, they are motherboards.
 I acquired five of these because I think they'd be cool nerd wall art and make cool gifts, but I'd love to know more about them.

They are no longer accepting upgrades, and I’m afraid to even try updating them manually. I work from home and the last time I upgraded them, I had to take PTO due to the firmware being faulty and having to restore to a previous version.
 While I really like the Unifi platform, I’m thinking of switching to Omada’s platform. My wireless is Ruckus Unleashed, and my security system is Reolink. I’ll never use the other features of the DreamMachines. 
 However, Omada is still a newer platform. They just released mDNS, which is what I’ve been holding out for. I see they are releasing a 10GB router, which would directly compete with the UDM platform. I’m debating about going into the Omada platform, or built a OPNSense box, and use that. However, at the end day I don’t want to futs with it, I really like my homelab, but the amount of time I dedicated to it is slowly declining, and if the internet goes out not only does it affect my work, but my wife will also not happy with me lol.
 The part I like about OPNSense, is the hardware HA and the ability to load balance two ISP connections which could come in handy 
 Any suggestions?

 Is there any simple, elegant, basic time-tracking and invoicing tool out there, like Harvest?

 Which self-hosted Free and open source eCommerce solution would you suggest and why? I am looking for the one with the most free features without having to pay for plugins. Drupal commerce has caught my eye, but please try and convince me otherwise.
 ​
 I know some will say it depends on lots of things, but why would you suggest one over the other in a general sense?

 I would also appreciate any article links on my choices, but must be a list of FOSS suggestions, please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to use Tdarr, but I'm currently trying Unmanic because it seems a bit simpler and easier to configure. However, whilst there are lots of installation write-ups, there isn't any plugin/job/process/test setup tutorials for 'standard' configurations that people might want to use. Anyone got any sources for these?
 I'm basically wanting to set it up to:
  
Use the intel quicksync plugin
 Only process files > 5GB
 Transcode to reduce them down using h264, but at a lower bitrate etc so aiming to get about 1GB/hour
 Only run processing/transcoding between certain hours (e.g., 1am => 5am)
  
I've added the plugin, a worker, and the filesize test (which I think does #2) but just want to see if somebody else has written up their settings so I can make sure I've got it right before I point it at my library. :)
 Running it on a Synology via Docker, although I don't think that's relevant for this question.

 -The LAN port of the card will be connected to a switch since this pfsense pc will have more VMS in the future. Nothing demanding, I'm just planning on a Raspberry Pi image VM (for 3D printer interface) and maybe more intresting stuff.

 I'm looking for a new Selfhosted Photo-App via Docker-Container.
 - I want to upload my Smartphone-Photos to a Nextcloud-Folder, e.g. directly "/Photos" or "/Import"
 - The PhotoApp should automatically scan this folder and generate Thumbnails / Face recognition / etc.
 - I want to have a Map-View, and automatically filter my photos for different places (e.g. Rome)
 - I want to be able to edit the "/Photos" Folder with 3rd-Party-Apps (e.g. Nextcloud), and the Photo-App should recognize these changes
 - I want to use the Photoapp without registration (secured via Authentik Forward Proxy) or via Authentik SSO
 Photoprism was really close after some customizations. However, after updating my docker container now, I lost the access to the normal Map-View (via Street/Satelitte), as they put this feature behind a paywall. However, this was my main usecase.
 Nothing wrong with creating new premium features for monetisation. However, removing existing features and destroying my running setup was a no-go for me, and I don't want to support this. 
 Any suggestions for alternatives? :)

 Edit-1: Top comments on this post says OpenAI is not "fully" open source.
 Then the usage of "Open" in the Name is deceiving?
 Edit-2: An Average Tech illiterate guy like me thinks this way, for example :
 OpenSpeedTest is Free and Opensource Software. As the name says, I can run the SpeedTest from the OpenSpeedTest website or host it on my home server or cloud server. Anything Open in the name means Opensource. That is what I know, like most people in r/selfhosted. Thanks for the clarification.

But seeing as Raspberry Pi’s are currently very expensive, it’s the next cheapest alternative. Has anyone done this before? It would probably be used to run Linux and mostly just headless usage. A lot of them say they have 8gb of DDR4 Ram and an old Intel i3-i7. Hard drive is usually the thing I’d replace since most of them are HDD. But other than that they seem fine for home labbing. Anyone try this?

 I started out using Postfix and Getmail. I am able to pull my email from my GMAIL account and store it on my local linux server.
 And then I added Procmail, to be able to sort it to folders based on content. I learned a lot about it and how to configure it, but not there yet as a functional solution.
 Where I am stuck is implementing a web-based interface to view that pulled email. And the next stage is sending email through my GMAIL account, although I was successful with an example. I am not to that stage yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crowd-sourcing workflows and good habits to managing contacts. Currently, my contacts are a mess. Whatsapp has their own copy, Telegram has their own copy, Google has their own..and then there's my phone. 
 Three things I need help with. 1) Deciding on what contacts are for. 2) Deduplicating contacts 3) Maintaining good house keeping habits for contacts
 For 1, I feel contacts should be a somewhat maintained list of "people I feel I may want to reach out to". I am unsure if it should extend to "people who will want to reach out to me". That way, I get rid a lot of noise, I reduce situations where I contact a stranger cause he/she picked up the old number of an acquaintance. Im just curious if there's any lost to losing people's contact. It happens all the time right?
 For 2, what's a good way to deduplicate them on all platforms? I have started with the contacts in Google. I went through each contact, cleaned up and standardized the data fields. Moving onto Telegram, I see a tonne of repeats. I feel I should sync between the curated Google contact list and Telegram, pray for some magic deduplication, and then sort through the rest again. Rinse and repeat for Whatsapp, then phone. Thing is, I'm unsure how the syncing works and if it will result in many more duplication on all involved platforms. There's v little visibility into which way the sync occurs. If it's 'To Google contacts', I can see what's out of place and edit accordingly. But anything else, manual curation and I'm bound to make mistakes cause I'm human.
 For 3, really, how do you do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey
 I've spent a good amount of time learning to use budibase and even if some obvious functions are (in my opinion) missing, even if the doc is reaaaaally limited... I quite like it. The thing is, I started using it only to build a PUBLIC form ; then it just showed me all the possibilities for all the workflow automation, all the admin functionnalities I could create for my compagny. But I've learnt -the hard way- that Budibase really isn't meant to build ant kind of app that has a public side.
 So I have two options : either I use my website (ghost) for the content and Budibase for data management and workflow ease / automation AND a form builder like limesurvey for the forms or I find something that can do both what Budibase can and can't do. Honnestly, two softwares is already enough softwares. I'd rather not use three.
 Is there anything that would fit the requirement ? I prefer open source but I can consider paid services if they're cheap bithout limiting functionalities to the bare minimum (like 500 submitions per months for 20$ and this kind of nonsense).
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks,
 So I am working on upgrading my hardware, mostly my TrueNAS and Proxmox servers. I've been running my plex container directly on my TrueNAS server (an old octocore phenom amd cpu) to give it direct access to storage, this has worked well for me, but now I am considering some other options during this upgrade process.
 My new servers will be dual xeons with 22 cores on each CPU. I know this is far overkill for TrueNAS, so I started thinking, maybe I should keep truenas on the octocore and create a VM with access to the storage on the truenas over my back end network. I'm going to be using teamed 4 port gigabit nics on each of the servers I am building to provide good network thruput to my vm hosts from TrueNas where the VM disks will be stored
 If I put the docker container in a VM and host it on proxmox over the network, do you think I will get similar performance over the VM as I would directly on the truenas box?
 Really the question is, do I want to waste(?) all that CPU power on truenas with some docker containers, or host it in a VM and be able to throw as many cores/memory at it as I want and leave the truenas server on the octocore phenom? This will let me use the 2 xeon systems I am building strcitly as proxmox servers and leave the lower end box as just a nas instead of nas and docker.
 I hope this makes sense, my thinking feels a bit scattered, but I think I got my point across
 Any advice would be appreciated!
 Thanks!~Rick

 an old Mac Air (early 2015) 
 a desktop whitebox with a Nvidia something-or-other that drives 4 monitors off 2 outputs (DP mini). It has about 3 boot drives with multiple partitions and a plethora of OSes. 
 ​
 I want to transition my daily driver to my Mac Air (soon to be replaced by a new MacPro) while still using my quad-monitor rig, but still retain access to my desktop (I like Linux when I'm just goofing around on the internet, doing CLI-based things, etc) with minimal physical effort (re-configuring cables, etc).
 Therefore, my mind goes to a docking station with a KVM or something, of the sorts. Anyone have any suggestions?

 I am building a small home server. Budget it about $700. Its main uses will be Plex, a general file server, a place to hold important data (wedding videos, youtube raw footage) and run a Valheim dedicated server. 
 I had originally planned on using one 8TB HDD as the storage drive for Plex movies. I was then going to store important data on two mirrored 1TB SSDs. But following my previous post I feel that these 1TB SSDs are a waste since if I delete a file, the mirrored will also be deleted. I could return them to free up budget for another 8TB HDD (16TB total). 
 Should I just get two HDDs, put everything on them, then backup important stuff in cloud storage, and/or an external location? Or stick with the original plan with the 1TB mirrored SSDs/8TB HDD?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For my ESXi host, I got an R730 to replace an R720 and cannot get the fans to go below 31% so asking for suggestions as it appears to be hardcoded in some way. Wondering if maybe via the idrac settings version, which is 2.40.40.05? 
 It is the latest BIOS/IDRAC and I have tried several older versions as well. It came with 2.15.10.10 and is now 2.83.83.83 and BIOS is 2.16.0. Due to habit from the R720s I stepped it up with every major release until current. ie 2.40.40.40 to 2.50.50.50. iDRAC was reset once current.
 running radadm via SSH shows the following and I already did the 3 settings to try and cut it down.
 /admin1-> racadm get system.thermalsettings
 [Key=system.Embedded.1#ThermalSettings.1]
 AirExhaustTemp=70
 #FanSpeedHighOffsetVal=71
 #FanSpeedLowOffsetVal=23
 #FanSpeedMaxOffsetVal=100
 #FanSpeedMediumOffsetVal=48
 FanSpeedOffset=Off
 #MFSMaximumLimit=100
 #MFSMinimumLimit=31
 MinimumFanSpeed=255
 ThermalProfile=Minimum Power
 ThirdPartyPCIFanResponse=Disabled
 Doing F2 then iDRAC then thermal ( think it was) I can set the fan min via a custom but 31 is the lowest it will let me. Via the iDrac web interface it shows that as well

 It is stock except I added a SATA drive (technically mSATA via converter), M.2 in PCIe slot and Mellanox X-3 card.Does have PERC H730 and 1/10GB NIC which as a side note I tried removing them but it would complain during POST so I put them back in. It runs ESXi 7. I was going to remove the storage and just use a USB liveCD to see if it changes due to the third party but per the racadm that's disabled anyway. 
 I'd rather not go IPMI route since the ESX can spin up at any second but thinking I may have to. Or go back to the R720.
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a bunch of dockerized services. Most of them are setup with a self-signed certificate to work via https, so chrome shuts up whenever I visit them. There are two problems with this: It's a pain in the ass and some services just refuse to do SSL.
 Reverse proxies to the rescue, right? There even is this docker image, that promises to magically do the job: https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy But then I have to deal with a bunch of DNS crap. My router knows that "pi" is supposed to be 192.168.178.3, but has no idea what nextcloud.pi is supposed to be.
 So as far as I know I could either buy a domain with subdomains or I could host my own DNS. I tried the adguard home docker image to host my own DNS and could even resolve the nslookup when explicitly told to resolve via the selfhosted DNS, but my router does not like that. I configured the router to use my selfhosted DNS for DNSv4 requests, but left the DNSv6 on default, since I don't think I can assign a static IPv6 to my raspberry pi that runs the DNS. I believe it is using that DNSv6 server, though. Also, I don't want to have no working internet whenever my raspberry pi has issues, so I don't like doing it this way.
 At this point I tried going the simple route: Just tell Chrome to shut the hell up whenever I go to that one server. But it seems like that also just will not work. 
 So do I have to buy a random domain to get this to work? That seems no less annoying. Is there no better way? Am I getting anything wrong? Should I just switch to Firefox?

 A couple of years ago the IronWolf Pro was what I thought best, but I’ve not encountered the Exos before. A quick search suggests they’ll be louder, but doesn’t say much otherwise.
 Oh wise hoarders, help me choose a drive? I’d prefer quieter, but I can always get a more soundproof enclosure (plan is to eventually have multiples of the same disk type in a new NAS) — the question is, what’re the real differences, and is there a reason the seemingly newer Exos is cheaper?
 Thanks! 🙏

 My main thing here is a performant server that is still energy efficient enough (I'm fortunate to have relatively inexpensive electricity per watt). I had thought about a ryzen build but I convinced myself that I want a late-gen intel with quicksync and not need a GPU in the server using more wattage. So I want thoughts on comparable intel chips for this setup, it's a NAS but my main service is plex so I want the quicksync for transcoding since I have a few family members offsite that use it from time to time. other than that it runs all *arr libraries, portainer/docker, nextcloud, nginx proxy, and about 10 other docker containers. The R710 is running most of the time under 30% CPU usage but it spikes at times.
 I'm working on not spending a ton of money as I don't need to. Intel i3-9100, I3-10100 and even i5-9600 have been thoughts. I want something that uses energy well, uses cores efficiently, has quicksync, and offers enough cores/bandwidth to do what I need to and then some (I want this to future proof me for a bit)
 Thanks for any thoughts!

 currently running a couple VMs with NVR and testers. plex, HA, and a couple other containers. I'm looking at the TRP 5965x + gigabyte WRX80 board.
 I like the threadripper for the cores + PCI lanes + RDIMMs I don't like that it's DDR4. 
 I'm hoping this build will last 5 or so years. Will it really matter for a while that I'm going on a DDR4 platform or should I hold off yet again for a DDR5 threadripper (Potentially another year or more)?

I am now aware of the raid controls on these servers. It has the Adaptec 5808 hba, which apparently can be flashed into IT mode to passthrough the HDDs. The drives on the onboard raid control can sometimes be seen by unraid but are showing as different drives than what the array was. My question, would it just be easier to just buy a compatable hba card for both of the backplanes? Will it then be just plug and play as if i was just moving the array to another PC? Also, Would any limitations of storage capacity be on the hba card or the backplane end? Most of my HDDs are currently 4tb but looking to upgrade to 6 or 8tb per drive. I am looking for the best way to move drives and be seen by Unraid with no new configuration. I can move the array from one pc to the next no problems. Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi team!
 I got me an R640, that I am planning to use with NVMe. What is the most reasonable approach to buying the NVMe storage? I don't need large capacities. 1-2-4 TB is more than I would possibly ever need. This will be running on ZFS, I guess as a mirror.
 So the question - what should I pursue? The used DC drives? New ones? Optane? Or may be this is a viable option: https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-M-2-U-2-Adapter-SFF-8639/dp/B073W65QX6
 or this: https://www.amazon.com/ICY-DOCK-Tool-Less-SFF-8639-Converter/dp/B07T8LJY23
 An adapter for the M.2. That last option looks tempting, since M.2 drives are getting real cheap. PCIe 3.0 in particular.
 Or am I completely on a wrong track and there is a better way to enjoy the NVMe?
 Thank you.

 I've set up a Paperless-NGX Docker and would like to connect to it from the outside with https. Is that possible? I also have nginx proxy manager running. I know I can VPN into my network and prolly should do that but I'm just asking.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I have about 12TB of data on my local NAS. Just purchased an 18TB drive to have that data backed up locally. For my third copy, after researching cloud providers (cost, speed, and reliability), I've come to the conclusion that it's best to set up another NAS/server that I will plug in at a friend's place.
 I have two things I would like feedback on:
  
Encryption: what do you recommend to encrypt my data off-site? Assuming the server is always connected to the internet when on, is there a way to make it so that when the computer starts up, the encrypted data is not accessible, where I get an email or notification to do somehow remotely unlock the data? What I'm trying to guard against is someone taking the server and accessing my private data. Assuming it gets stolen, I'd like to know that the data is encrypted and not accessible.
 
Syncing: given this data size (12TB now, 20TB in 5 years), is it best to keep the data in sync using Syncthing? Or would the size cause issues for Syncthing? If so, I would just have a daily Cron job to rsync the data.
 
 Welcome any insights you all are willing to share. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently came across a deal on some free older Intel Nucs, mainly Nuc5ppyh models but also some Nuc5cpyh models. I have about 65 total (way more than I need) and they have a mix 2/4 gb of ram and 120/240gb of SSD storage. They all run N3700s or N3050s and can only accept one stick of DDR3L.
 ​
 While I have been wanting to find some fun homelab projects to do with them I was not sure if these would be worth my time or if I should find better hardware? Running the steam link app and gaming off my desktop does run smoothly so far.
 ​
 I was going to use a few for things like a portable kodi/plex box with a projector. Would it be possible to manage a NAS through one? or play around with active directory? 
 ​
 My current home setup is just a laptop for general use and a Gaming PC for gaming and media storage. I would love to get a rack for home and run a couple servers though. Thanks for any feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am using an Apache webserver internally to serve SSL pages to my local LAN and publicly. My LAN supports LE certificates. Let's say my public cert is *.foo.com and my internal is *.priv.foo.com. I use Apache name-based routing. The following pages are example internal-only sites and both work perfectly. My goal is expose them publicly.:
  
https://host1.priv.foo.com
 https://host2.priv.foo.com
  
This seems easy and so I configure NPM proxy hosts as follows:
  
Domain name:host1.foo.com, Scheme: https, Forward Hostname: host1.priv.foo.com, Port:443
 Domain name:host2.foo.com, Scheme: https, Forward Hostname: host2.priv.foo.com, Port:443
  
host1.foo.com works as expected; however, host2.foo.com routes to https://host1.priv.foo.com. I am trying to understand why this is happening especially since the internal pages work fine. Do you have any ideas on how to troubleshoot this? I have full access to both NPM and Apache and so can make any needed config changes.
 TIA!
 Update for future viewers:
 This was not an NPM issue, but an Apache one. The solution was to add a "ServerAlias" directive in the config file. See below for details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a folder that is approximately 500GB with about 80,000 files in it (mostly PDFs) on a machine which is synced with a service similar to dropbox. In seeking to do routine backups, and remove this data from my main machine eventually, I installed the sync service on another machine, and set it out to 'sync'. 
 The new machine now reports the sync is complete, however when I do a rightclick to check properties, the report between the two machines does not match. The file count and storage count differ, by several gigs and thousands of files.
 I can see a couple of possibilities: 
  
The two machines count files/space differently, since they are different OS, which seems weird but possible. The reporting does not reflect reality. I am unsure of how I would validate this given it's thousands of files. 
 There is some amount of data loss on syncing between machines (this would be very bad). This could be due to some error of transfer I suppose, file incompatibility or corruption?
  
I'm not even sure what the correct search term would be for this phenomenon except 'data loss on transfer'
 I can provide exact numbers if helpful, if there is some kind of calculation

 So currently, I've got 14 drives (varying from 8tb to 14tb) in a Fractal XL7 case.
 It's becoming apparent that I'm going to need more space. However, I'd like to stay on my current OS and not replace the CPU/RAM/etc. that I've got.
 It seems to me that an external JBOD SAS is probably my best option, but I'm running into issues due to my lack of experience with these. Most of what I'm finding in the price range I want to spend (less than $500 by the time I add in the cables I'd need) won't do above SATA2. Does anyone have any advice?
 Definitely ok (and expecting) used hardware. Also my ultimate goal here is to buy a bunch of new 16tb drives and stick those in it, create a RAID6 array, copy my other data over, and then add those old drives to the array. 
 I'd appreciate any advice here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here's my use-case for this. All my devices are connected to WireGuard, and they can access everything. However, I have a work laptop that I want to connect to my BitWarden, without connecting it to WireGuard. I should also mention that I cannot install any VPNs or tunneling software on it, so VPNs/CloudFlare tunnel are out.
 I have NGINX acting as a reverse proxy, and I use CloudFlare for traffic not coming from WireGuard (I have 1 public endpoint for Home Assistant's API for Google Home devices since they're a pain). I'm using all the geo-blocking and fail2bans, but how can I limit an endpoint's access to just 1 specific device if the traffic is from Cloudflare (I still want traffic from local network or WireGuard to pass through), regardless of IP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time follower of this subreddit and first time poster. I’m fairly new to DAS.
 I was wondering if anyone else has experience similar issues with their Terramaster D5-300 DAS and shucked WD 20TB WD2000EDGZ drives.
 I’m not using this in RAID, just default single disk mode. 
 I recently bought both and have began the install process and powering it on. I’ve noticed the 2x 20TB causes the lights to turn solid orange and repeated beeping. (All drives have been formatted already for Mac OS Extended Journaled ahead of installation.) This happens in any slot I put either 20TB drives in and both when they’re both in. I’ve pulled the drives out and connected the 20TB drives using a USB to SATA cable and they are recognized and works fine.
 However, my 2x 14TB WD140EDGZ drives and 1x 10TB WD100EMAZ can be placed in any slot and are recognized and works as intended. When all 5 drives are in, only the 20TBs exhibit the orange light and beeping from the DAS.
 There isn’t much documentation about this online or on their forums and thought to ask the community if they had similar experiences as I wait for a response from their support. Any insights or advice would be appreciated, thanks in advance.

 DELL 0HPDKH 9286CV-8e MEGARAID SAS 
 I have this LSI MegaRAID SAS 2208 controller that has been working fine. I re-installed ubuntu (I messed up the boot partition on accident) and now am having issues with drives not showing up after reboots. The kernel log shows the board failing to init.
  
[ 256.905504] megaraid_sas 0000:41:00.0: Failed to transition controller to ready from megasas_init_fw! 
 [ 256.905657] megaraid_sas 0000:41:00.0: Failed from megasas_init_fw 6548
  
I went to bed last night after hours of reboots and messing with this thing to wake up this morning with all drives showing up?!
 Fast forward to some updates I did and a required reboot and now again the drives are all missing.
 Does anyone have any ideas why this is happening? I mean I understand that the card is not initialized properly. Just not sure why.

 Is it a good idea to store my sensitive data on two mirrored SSDs, or should I instead mirror two HDDs and throw all data on them? Thanks.

I am currently using SHR(Synology Hybrid Raid) and running DSM 6.2. Need advice on the best, most efficient and the fastest way to do this. Which would you guys recommend ?
 1.Add one 20TB drive in 4th bay Use "Replace Drive" and let the array build it and then once its complete, remove the 9TB drive and then "Add Drive" the next 20TB Drive
 OR
 2.Pull out all the data from the NAS which is currently 16TB occupied space while keeping the pool intact and then repeat Step 1 ?
 Also, I am currently on DSM 6.2. Do you guys recommend upgrading to DSM 7. Will DSM 6.2 support 20TB drives ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to build a tiny cluster for my work experiments with kubernetes and possibly to host a few my own applications in the future.
 As hardware for the cluster I wanted to use Raspberry Pi 4 CM4 on Turing Pi board, but as many of you know - it's nearly impossible to buy a raspberry right now, so I think I have two possible options:
 - Build a cluster using Raspberry Pi alternative - Orange Pi: 4xOrange Pi 4LTS 4gb or 3xOrange Pi 5 with 8gb ram each.
 - Build a cluster using NUC 5PPYB (around 50$ on Amazon). 
 I think it's easy to achieve working k3s cluster with the second option, but I also like an idea to have my own Pi (not Raspberry although) cluster. What I don't like about Orange Pi is a small community and less tutorials and documentation comparing to Raspberry Pi community. Because it'll be my first SBC it could be difficult for me to setup everything. 
 What do you think about both options? Maybe I miss something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have had my unraid server out of commission for a while since the motherboard (ASROCK C2750d4i) died year ago. I sent it off to get fixed under warranty via advice on reddit and was contacted by ASROCK EU team on reddit itself. On return, it worked for a few months before dying again.
 I want to get it back up and running for family photos/4k videos and need a reliable alternative.
 - The mini-itx would need to fit snug, I am using a SilverStone SST-DS380 (20tb x 8 bay enclosure + 1xSSD).
 - Preferably be low powered. If it has a built-in low-powered CPU, that would be a plus. I do have a spare 4770k and i5 from the same generation lying around spare 
 - An onboard controller to support 8+ drives.
 I am not looking for anything impressive. It will just need to be running at all times and be used as an accessible network drive around the house and running a plex server to access family media. Nothing more.
 ​
 Any ideas please on what to replace with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I have a 10" rack at home, 12U height. Currently have installed there a PDU, ethernet switch, router and power injector for internet access ODU installed on the roof of my house. On the bottom there is a plastic pipe (that goes under the ground to the street) where fiber would be placed in the future. In near future I plan to install also NVR for cameras and NAS for storage.
 ​
 Since I'm working remotely from home, I need backup power supply in case of power outage, that happens from time to time for couple of minutes. It is a problem when you are providing training online for bunch of people and network goes down :). I was looking for 10" rack AC UPS, but there are none on the market. I was looking for modular UPS with external battery, but none for 10" rack.
 ​
 Since all my current and future devices are DC powered I've decided to use buffer switch mode power supply unit. There are sockets for 230V AC input, 12V DC output, connectors for battery. Battery can perfectly fit at the bottom of the shelf where I had a free space (next to this pipe for fiber). PSU fits in standard 10" rack 1U shelf with extra metal sheet wall in the front (custom build). I've installed also status LEDs that shows status of AC input, DC output, battery charge. I've installed fuse module with 4 outputs, so each of my devices have own fuse. One of devices works only with 9V, so I've installed also DC/DC converter from 12V to 9V. I've selected 12V 9Ah battery and set 1A charging current.
 ​
 Currently my devices consume at most in total 15W, so 9Ah battery is enough for 7h+. After I add planned devices it will increase to 45W, so battery would keep devices on for ~2h 30min. I plan to replace then a battery with bigger one.
 ​
 Here are some photos.

 This is how it looks currently, free space is for future devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I’m a professional photographer who makes 8-12TB a year of data. My previous system catastrophically failed on me last month, so I’m back to the drawing boards. 
 I’ve already ordered most of what I think I need, but looking for validation that this is a decent idea before I set it all up, fire up the single copy of my current archive data that still exists and start to copy that over to the new system. 
 Primary location/archives: Synology 920+, 4x14TB drives, RAID5
 Studio location (offsite): Synology 720+, 2x14TB, RAID1
 Cloud: Google Drive Enterprise
 My plan is to split the main array into 3 folders @ ~14TB/ea. I plan to mirror these folders to the array offsite as a backup to my primary archives. When the offsite backup array gets full, the drives in it will be pulled, put into secure storage, replaced, then mirrored with the next folder. Hopefully that system makes sense? This would hopefully result in me only needing to fuss with this backup array once every 18months or so. 
 My plan had initially been to use RAID5 for the on-site system, but upon further research, it seems like people really don’t like this setup? I was hoping to have several years of my most recent archives available locally so I can pull images for proposals, website, etc, and RAID5 would give me 42TB with this set-up. ~in theory~, since I’d have a physical backup of this data, I’d be able to arduously restore the data in the case of a dramatic failure/rebuild failure?
 I’m wondering now if I’d be better off doing RAID10 for my primary archives. I think 28TB would give sufficient access to files id need to access occasionally, and it seems people find this to be a more reliable and trustworthy set-up? 
 Both RAID arrays would be for archiving only, and data would very rarely be altered once it was stored. 
 Money spent on drives is also not really an issue. Just want reliable, and secure. 
 What do you think?

 So, I have been wanting to upgrade my switch on my homelab for a little bit and have found this Cisco switch on eBay:
 https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/153618327472
 It's a Catalyst 3750X with 48 GBe ports. It also comes with a C3KX-NM-10G module installed, which should hopefully give my 10GBe via SFP.
 It's AU$349 (which is around US$234.30)
 Is it a good deal, or should I continue shopping around for something else?
 Thanks for any help in advance! :)

 I plan to run Pihole, PiVPN, Radarr, and a file server. It has a 256GB NVMe SSD which I plan to install the OS on. I also plan to put a 1TB SATA SSD in for storage.
 My question is, for my use case, would it be better to run everything above bare metal with like Debian or Ubuntu Server, or a hypervisor like Proxmox and run all my desired services in VMs?

 Mac mini (Mid 2011, i5, 16GB RAM) - Proxmox host running a VM to then host Portainer and
 a plethora of Docker apps. All the container data volumes point to the Synology NFS to allow for backup and the VM is backed up regularly using Proxmox.
 Intel NUC D54250WYKH (Intel Core i5-4250U) - Home-Assistant box. Running in fanless enclosure.
  
I then had a couple of spare (I know, first world problem) Mid 2011/2012 Mac minis of a similar spec that I would also use as a Proxmox playground for testing etc.

 I've been wanting to get pi-hole running in my apartment for awhile now. However the markups on rasberry pi's are outrageous right now, and my search for an alternative led me here. Have a used Dell Wyze 5070 (16gb flash, 4gb ram, 1.5ghz quad core Celeron) thin client on the way.
 Assuming I won't be able to customize the xfinity combo modem to work for pihole. So I've pulled out my Asus N66U Black Knight router, planning on placing the xfinity in bridge mode and running that. Newest fw I could find was DD WRT from late 2020.
 Is that fw recent enough or should I be looking for a new router? While I'm sure the router is good enough for my miniscule needs I need it to be secure as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a flat where my desktop PC (which I use for work) and the ISP router are at the absolute opposite corners, with multiple walls and doors between. Running Ethernet without drilling holes isn't possible due to some unfortunate obstructions.
 I moved here about ~3.5 years ago and, having resigned myself to a wireless existence, decided to get the best possible router and PCI-E WiFi card I could find. At the time, those were the Netgear Nighthawk R9000 and Asus PCE-AC88 respectively. In 2022, there is still nothing better than that Asus for 4x4 MIMO.
 Anyway, it all started very simple. ISP router in modem mode, and the Netgear doing all the heavy lifting:

 This served me well for quite a while and I've been able to achieve ~750Mbps between WAN and my desktop PC. Not quite maxing out the gigabit link, but close enough.
 Recently, I got the itch from this subreddit and decided to take advantage of some Black Friday deals and build my own OPNsense router. It took about a day to set everything up, but it turned out great! (pictures here)
 Around the same time, I also decided to build myself a Kubernetes cluster because 1- why not and 2- I've been meaning to play with it for a while. For that, I grabbed three ThinkCentre M92p Tiny PCs from eBay. These are great little machines with an i5-3470T, 16GB RAM and 128GB SSD. Not bad for £70 each!
 Overall, the network now looks like this:

 I still have a lot to learn and experiment with, but I'm pretty happy with this setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a pretty jank data hoarding setup built in an old tower with 4x4TB HDDs in a software RAID0 that is then combined with 2x16TB drives in a software RAID5, plus two JBOD SSDs for the OS and cache. Currently it's being managed with mdadm via the Cockpit project on CentOS 8 Stream. This has worked fine, but the machine that is handling my storage is also handling all of my other processing; Plex server, various VMs, game servers, etc.
 I've just purchased a new rack and plan to rackmount this machine in a Rosewill RSV-L4500U and grab a few used Dell Poweredge servers to use as ESXi hosts. In the process, I plan to add a few more drives to the array and I'd like to switch to an operating system that's more dedicated to managing storage. I've looked into TrueNAS and Unraid, but both seem to have a pretty major drawback that makes them less than ideal for me; TrueNAS appears to be exceptionally difficult to add drives to after the fact, which means I'd need to buy vastly more HDDs all at once, and Unraid suffers from poor read performance due to its single-spool nature, which isn't ideal for loading VMs off of. I still need to have this machine run the Plex server, as it'll be the only chassis that can fit the GPU for hardware transcoding. 
 I might just be misunderstanding the use-cases and features of these operating systems, and if so, please do inform me! What I'm really looking for is a storage-focused OS that makes it simple to manage and monitor traditional RAID, but I'm finding that surprisingly difficult to find! 
 Wondering if any of you have experience with any solutions that might fit my needs.

 I want to be able to deploy a full homelab, authentication, backups, logs, DNS, VPN access etc... as automated as reasonable. I want to just be able to point at something like Vultr or Kubernetes running on TrueNAS Scale then be able to log in to a dashboard like yacht or portianer with a list of apps I can boot up for the first time.
 I have been personally working on something like this and want to get some some feedback from yall, or find the project that does this all already so I can throw away my code. Currently my project deploys on Vultr or a VM. sets DNS records, basic Auth on required applications, as well as a Yacht instance for oneself to manage apps easily. I have a roadmap here. I would not reccomend anyone run it... yet
 P.S. Any reccodmentdations for self hosting an Obsidian Vault let me know, the options I tried so far suck

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a series of podcasts I am trying to download, to transcribe, to use for academic use. An example podcast is here: http://legaldesignpodcast.com/episode-51-joining-the-boring-revolution-with-indy-johar/. Using videodownloader on Firefox, I can generate a .js file which about about 8mb. I'm assuming that's a javascript file that gets downloaded. Normally if I got a .js file, I would think that's just a call for online streaming, but if the file is 8mb...?
 Once I've got it in .mp3 (or AAC, MP3, M4A, WAV, WMA, MOV, MPEG, MP4, WMV), generating a transcript is easy. 
 It's been a long time since I've done this, but I feel there must be a simple way to either download from source as MP3 or do a simple conversion. The answer isn't to simply change the extension to .mp3 in this case. 
 Another option is to source the podcast from Spotify, but all of the options I've seen are paid downloader apps with so-so reviews. There are no transcripts on either site for the podcast.

Anytime I try to setup a LAG between anything the connections start flapping. If I run a single connection everything runs great. 
 How I'm setting these up (maybe I'm doing something wrong). On the downstream device (in this case the CSS) I configure I make sure both sfp ports are active, go to the LAG tab and mark both as active and hit apply. Then I do the same on the upstream switch. Connection starts flapping. Reboot both devices. Connection still flapping. Close one of the ports in the LAG and connection is stable. 
 ​
 What am I doing wrong? I also have tried setting up a LAG between my pfsense router and the CRS326 with the same results, connection starts flapping. Same results going to my dell server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've read what feels like countless discussions on scanners and scanning processes to the point where it makes me slightly nauseous. I'm new to it. I'm buying a scanner in January and finally embarking on my long awaited scanning journey. I intend to digitze my collection of fashion magazines - and the most important aspect of them are the images, of course. It is very important to me to do a great job with the quality of those scans and all my extensive reading brings me to conclusion that destroying my very expensive magazines is the best way to go about it, because it provides a flat scan with minimum shadows and imperfections I can edit out afterwards. I settled on an Epson Perfection V600 scanner. Good, affordable, but fairly small considering how big vintage magazines used to be. But it seems like a good starting point. Any scanning tips from experienced photo scanners would be appreciated. 
 However, that is not my main issue. I tried tearing apart my first magazine today and I don't know if I did it right. A lot of the articles mentioned guillotines and specific cutters for something like this, but considering that a lot of the advertisement and editorial images inside fashion magazines tend to be spread across two pages and I don't want any gaps in between them, it seems unwise to use a cutter to cut away the entire spine and most likely several milimeters of each page in the process. So I went and did it manually, page by page. I did it carefuly and very gently and I pulled out pages as close to the spine as it was possible, but the glue or whatever it is that binds the pages together left the edges of my tear sheets quite jagged and messy looking. Is that normal? Surely, I can edit that out in Photoshop, but I would love to know if there's a way of getting cleaner edges on the tear sheets without cutting off any of the picture. I'm providing some images of my tear sheets. All help is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 Am new here. I've been reading up on bit rot for the last few days and several threads have appeared in this sub-reddit that have given conflicting opinions on this topic. Am curious as to what the current consensus was?
 For reference I currently run a raspberry pi 3 with 2 HDDs attached, both ext4. 1 HDD is exposed via smb which all the family access and then a cron job runs once every 2 weeks to rsync to the other HDD. Another cron job then runs once a month to rclone the content to google-drive. Our data is relatively small ~ 300GB, the vast majority being photos + home videos.
 So yer is bit rot really something I need to be concerned about / pro-actively defend against? Or is it unlikely to ever really be an issue and not worth the hassle?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm trying to make my own QTS/Synology replacement with my NAS and various NUC.
 The idea is to have my main NAS with OpenMediaVault, which will have 3x 8TB in a RAID. It will also have Portrainer+docker swarm.
 I've then several devices(Zimaboard 832) that I would like to use as node of my docker swarm.
 Then I've a lot of different container that I want to dispatch accross the nodes, the ones I could think right now being:
  
PyMedusa
 Plex server
 Transmission
 Prism(photo library)
 Paperless(achiving of docs)
 NextCloud(network share)
 OpenVPN
 Home Assistant
 Heimdall for input dashboard
 revert proxy
  
Just to give an idea:
 ​

 ​
 I'm not familiar yet with docker swarm(comfortable with docker though), but since all my storage space will be available on the main NAS, and some of those container will have to use some common folder(typically, pymedusa-plex server-transmission), what is my best option to provide the different storage to my containers, that might be on different docker node? Does my architecture make sense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me preface this with one statement: replacement drives are already on order, mostly trying to figure things out. 
 Been having some odd issues with one of my arrays and seeking an opinion on wtf is going on. 
 Kicked off a scrub overnight and came back to emails like this:
  
The number of I/O errors associated with a ZFS device exceeded
 acceptable levels. ZFS has marked the device as faulted.
 impact: Fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised.
 class: statechange
 state: FAULTED
  
and this:
  
The number of checksum errors associated with a ZFS device
 exceeded acceptable levels. ZFS has marked the device as
 degraded.
 impact: Fault tolerance of the pool may be compromised.
 class: statechange
 state: DEGRADED
  
With the scrub being basically stopped and the system running a resliver
 Ended up cancelling the scrub and re-running it later that day to similar results.
 Now for the really screwy result:
 Moved the drives (they're in a removable drive cage) from this LSI SAS controller:
  
Serial Attached SCSI controller: Broadcom / LSI SAS2008 PCI-Express Fusion-MPT SAS-2 [Falcon] (rev 03)
  
to this controller (in the system as a now unused relic of a recent data/drive shuffle)
  
SATA controller: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. 88SE9215 PCIe 2.0 x1 4-port SATA 6 Gb/s Controller (rev 11)
  
and everything's running fine with another scrub...
 The other drive array on the LSI SAS card completed it's scrub without issues.
 Are my drives failing? not sure what is going on.
 edit: there it goes, borked on the marvell controller, just took quite a bit longer (percentage wise) so it appears my drives are failing...?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello I am kinda just starting off trying to save all my family’s photos over the years and I have a few questions to ask you guys. Everything I’ve read on this sub says just to start simple and small and work your way up and to have another location for files. So I have some flash drives I’ve gained over the years some new some old, a brand new 2tb and a hand me down 1tb drive and a photo scanner and I want to do it right so I have a few questions. 
 First: Storage. I found a leather zip up case on Amazon to put all the drives in. Are these recommended for storage or is there any way to go wrong with just flash drives and small hard drives? As far as another location goes, my family will all have copies of the photos when I am done and even as I start to save them I’ll keep some drives at my brother’s house. But do you guys recommend cloud saving, and if so what service? 
 Second: File saving. I don’t know much about computer files and compression or anything like that. I also have some files coming from Mac devices and don’t know if it will be important for all files to be the same file type when all is said and done? Is this preferred, should i convert all my file types to a certain type like png or jpg or both? And should I keep these files compressed onto flash drives so you have to unzip them to view them or am I overthinking this portion? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

I also understand one cannot just assume that these HDDs arrived in perfect working order and that some preliminary tests should be done. I started by doing a full format, as opposed to a quick one. Which programs should I run afterwards using Windows and what should I be on the lookout for before I proceed to do my backups ? Thanks much for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey hosters! Anyone ever thought of self-hosting a digital business card (maker)? I’m looking for something similar to commercial services that allow to visually build a number of “cards” in a way of a pages with contact data and a vcf download link. I’m not sure if it is okay to give references to the sites I try to mimic to have control over my card(s). EnBizCard is probably the only attempt on this from the OSS community that I was able to find. It is a different approach though.

 the planned network panel diagram
 This is the household demarc from the garage datacenter. 
 The end result
 It bridges 2 additional networking centers, an inside the house media closet with a 24 port switch, some 10G MM fiber drops, and one 40Gb connected VM server.
 Adding in 10Gbit switching gear to this panel allows me to span the garage racks and the inside network/media closet in a more planned manner than I had prior. It was OM-1 cable vomit inside this cabinet prior.
 The whatever phase of this network panel
 I also added in the 16 port 1 Gbit TP-link switch…]]></summary>

 I have little knowledge of NAS, but was going to dig in a bit. I want to use my NAS drives (probably 2 X 2TB) as backups mirroring my volume on Hetzner storage. 
 I also wanted to have a fallback load balancer present in case my VPS is down, which proxies connections to my DNS server and wireguard, so I’ll be hosting some application containers on here. I mention this because this is one main reason I’m not interesting in synology (I want to run computationally expensive jobs)
 Anything people recommend to read outside just the hardware stuff for self managing a NAS?

 "Reverse Proxy" forwards data to relevant SIP server on LAN
 Single set of port forwards permitting relevant traffic from remote sites to the "reverse proxy" which forwards on to SIP server based on subdomain. (like NGINX would do with http/s traffic)
  
I started to dig into traefic a bit but don't want to go to far down the rabbit hole if it is not feasible.
 Is there a service that can do this? Ideally this would be an opensource solution but would consider a paid option if necessary. Am I better off just using a vpn than getting this configuration set up/working?
 Thank you for any insight anyone can provide.
 Edit: I would be interested in trying this with some other non-http services as well (specifically video) which is why I am considering this path.

 I am looking for a nice online IDE (like VS code).
 As I want to expose it to the internet it would need to have an OIDC/SAML/OAuth2 compatible authentication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Seagate External Game Drive Hub, this one specifically, and I am experiencing some abnormalities with it. I have written 4TB of data to it and deleted it after backing up my NAS. Now I use it only for storing Steam Games, so I don't have to ever redownload them in the future.
  
On occasions my Steam games fail to update
 It slows down my computer when connected sometimes, and then my pc is normal when I unplug it
 Sometimes it takes forever to open the drive to see the files
  
I've only had this drive for 8 months and it is connected via USB. Should I attempt to shuck it and just connect it via SATA to the MOBO or attempt to get a warranty claim on it?

I have a lot of external hard drives that I connect to my computer at regular intervals, sometimes up to 6 at the same time. I have a Belkin power strip that has 8 individual power supply outlets but they all have a single on off switch. I bought a couple of power stripes off Amazon with individual on/off switches but they have been less than ideal in quality. Can any fellow data holder please suggest a good quality power strip with individual on/off switches whereby I can connect up to 8 devices at the same time? I am currently living in a non western country so I would appreciate brands that are global.

 The PC will just be bunged safely in the car, but I feel like I remember people giving advice such as taking the harddrives out or something during transport, minimising chances of vibrations etc.
 Any advice? Should I buy particular carry cases? Will the HDDs be fine for the sake of 2 hours?
 I'm backed up of course, but still.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might not be at the best place to ask, but trying anyways.
 I have 2 hard drives on my pc and one external hard drives for music production and other side hustle.
 What I did is I made folders for each hard drive on my backup 1 drive and backup 2 drive, and I use FreeFileSync to mirror them onto my backup drives.
 I don't own much important documents but my music production stuff is easily 800 GB and I want to future proof it. 
 I thought about using a cloud storage backup solution but it would take literally days to download all of it back (tested it).
 So my questions are:
  
Is 2 backup drives too much? I feel like I'm going over kill because the average person would only have 1 small cheap backup drive.
 
Should I backup literally everything (including OS), some things (User files like documents, pictures, etc.) or only important things (ex: my insurance papers)
 
How do you manage version control? Let's say I make a monthly backup and one day I modify a file on my computer. But it wont automatically update on the backups too. Is there a way to do this efficiently without having to worry about having the wrong version of my file?
 
 I'm using FreeFileSync to mirror my data, because it would take too long to do a backup from scratch everytime. The one I'm doing right now takes about 16 hours (both backup drives included).
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody I have multiple external drives that I kept all my files. I have used "whereisit" software for cataloging and to save content of these discs. It was a great software because it scans all the files inside a drive and save the content of this drive to its database. Then whenever I am looking for a file I search through whereisit database without even connecting the related external drive.
 As far as I understand from the whereisit web site it is discontinued so I am looking for an self hosted alternative software to make a catalogue of a drive if there is one.
 Primarily it will be used for scan and cataloging/searching a file inside offline hard drives. I will scan the files and find the which disk contains this file. Primarily I want to access GUI from web browser and search or browse files inside disks. If I can scan network mapped drives it will be awesome.

 For now, I only used it to scan different networks from outside ... (Nmap), And now I'm considering moving some of my containers there (monitoring, some static sites, etc.), maybe with some Kubernetes cluster.. (but I'm still learning them)
 What is your experience? :)

My wasabi + arq backups were getting a bit expensive. One of the downsides i'm seeing is that concurrent connections seem to be restricted, though it's not exactly clear how many are allowed. Also, the snapshot setup only allows you one type of frequency (you have to choose between daily or weekly, unlike rsync.net where you can have daily, weekly and monthly)

 I'm now searching for a new selfhosted S3 Storage, but mostly found software designed for multi node setups and incomplete documentation for single node, file system storage setups.
 I just want a docker image and point it to a directory and run it, maybe some per bucket access control but that's it..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the start of this year, I finally ditched my iPhone for an Android phone and have since been having one particular issue: I have many, many gigabytes of old pictures that are quasi unorganized (thanks, iTunes...) but have all the proper meta-data - and that from all the way back of owning an iPhone 3GS on 3.1.3 no less! So the backlog is pretty big - and many memorable memories are hidden within.
 I looked at Damselfy but it seems to be geared more towards photographers, not for point-and-shoot type photography like random ol' me just snapping a picture because of something happening.
 Do you know of one that can: - Iterate through all my files and organize them by their (EXIF, largely) metadata? - Has an Android app so I can view them when on the go? (Yes, my hosted instance will be available outside through a Nebula VPN setup.) - Optionally recognize and thus "tag" pictures by faces? It'd be neat to pull up all the pictures with a specific person in it.
 Thanks! :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm the creator of Kubero, the open-source Heroku alternative for Kubernetes. For version 1.3.0 I focused on self-hosting.
 It should be your own choice where you want to host your code and your application. And this was something a really disliked on Heroku, that you can only deploy from GitHub.
 I'm happy to announce that Kubero now supports
  
GitLab
 Gitea
 Gogs
 Bitbucket
 GitHub.
  
You can now automatically deploy your apps with a git push
 from any of these git providers. It does not matter if it's hosted on codeberg.org or gitlab.com or your self-hosted instance.
 I hope you like it, and if you have any feedback, or suggestions for other git repositories, please let me know.
 PS: Onedev was also planned, but I was not able to find any API documentation. I hope someone can guide me in the right direction. It is still on my roadmap. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, this is yet another cloud backup question. I've researched a whole bunch, but some of the posts are old so I wanted to know what the current status of the service is from the usual providers.
 How is Backblaze with upload/download speeds for their Personal backup plan? Is the restore process still limited by how you can restore the files, and how fast you can download them?
 Is the Backblase B2 better than the personal plan? Are there fewer restrictions/limits compared to the Personal plan? Does it allow you keep the files on the cloud even if you unplug the hard drive for many days? I think the Personal has a 30 day limit. How easy is the restore process? Does it allow you to select all files and do a backup?
 As for Crashplan, does it also have limitations for upload/download speed and how you can restore the backup? What about iDrive, icedrive, GDrive, DropBox, etc? I know I'm asking a lot but there is not much information on people's experiences with restoring the backups.
 I have about a minimum of 4TB of data I want to backup. In total I have close to 100TB of personal files, ripped CDs, and movies. I was thinking Blackblaze B2, but you have to rely on 3rd apps to use it, which is fine with me. My data is currently on a 8x14TB ZFS NAS machine running Ubuntu. I would like to be able to upload/download as fast as I can. I'm on a symmetric 500mbps fiber line. My main priority is to keep my 4TB of priceless data safe, and be able to restore quickly and not have the cloud provider delete it after the drive being offline for at least 30 days, but 60 days would be better.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title states, I’m using a Cisco RV320 for a side project. It is running the latest firmware. Part of its function is to act as an OpenVPN server. The issue is the default 10 year certificate in the router has expired therefore preventing a VPN connection. I have attempted to create another self signed certificate and marked it as primary to no avail. Also, the OpenVPN server is setup for password authentication only but I believe the router itself requires a certificate.
 Does anyone have any insight on how to handle this?

I'm preparing to move to a new house and i want to run cables from all the rooms from 3 floors. i calculated that up and down i would need 15m cables max from certain rooms. House (located in Europe) has pipes everywhere where i can run easily the cables. Do i really need to put solid cable as it doesn't really pass through walls ? The ideal would be full copper cables/cat6a/23AWG/solid/CMP and Poe++ needed for my various Unifi devices but a proper one from a reputable business vendor with all tests done, etc has around 50 eu. Is it worth it or i could go for a stranded/pure copper/26AWG/poe++/CM from the same vendor with around 15eu per cable ? i know it would cost me probably cheaper to buy a roll and do it myself but i don't really have the time to punch down every single cable and test it separately and i would prefer a ready made solution.

 New to proxmox and servers as a whole. 
 I have an old optiplex with an i7-2600s, 32 gigs 1333 ddr3, and a 500gb pny ssd
 I understand I can't store VMs on the boot media and proxmox doesn't like used drives as I have 2 hdds that I had lying around I was going to use to just mess around with, but won't pop up in the interface. 
 I was planning to replace the CD drive on the computer with a couple of 2.5" drive hotswap bay. I should have enough PCI lanes to put 2 PCI controllers for 10 sata cables (1x and 4x) and buy a couple dozen cheap pny 500gb SSDs and a couple of HDDs as backup drives. 
 I don't have any important data. I'm just playing around with it now and going for a budget build that pushes the limits of my old hardware. I plan to do these upgrades in waves, buy 1 PCI card, 1 hotswap bay, and 6 SSDs. Then later do it again.
 Questions:
 Is there anything I need to consider? Does proxmox work with generic Newegg PCI sata cards? Do I need dedicated raid controllers? I only have a 500w psu, does it need more juice for mass SSD additions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saw a few people post on the topics of CICD, and wanted to ask if anyone has recommendations for the build (this is my first time building server, I have built a PC for gaming). My main problem is, not sure whether I need higher performance cores for build/compilation (both typescript transpilation, node library build/install, and react native compilation out to android) or more cores with lower clocks to scale test parallelization. Is there a way to have cake and eat it too? Has anyone built/specced anything similar? 
 Goals
  
Support self hosted github actions runners with autoscaling, to support nodejs, react, and react native builds + testing. The testing is done with jest, which really likes cores. More cores = more tests that run in parallel.
 
A centralized way to manage files and folders as a place to back up across various laptop and media devices. Also support future home projects around video storage. I like the idea of a NAS with the additional functionality of general server/compute.
 
Support docker containers, devops tooling, and environment to learn all the fun networking items for self hosting webapps.

 I currently have sas drives but was thinking maybe I should switch to cheaper SSDs and they are brand new.
 Anyone done that knows what should I do? I know SAS has better performance while being accessed by many users but can SATA SSD perform just like that?

I've heard good things about APC, but I've also heard that their newer models aren't really all that great. I've heard good things about Eaton, and so far I don't see many people complaining about them. To my knowledge their UPS's are also more common than APC's in enterprises and shit.
 Can y'all help me decide? I don't need something that big since I'll mainly be using it to provide a graceful shutdown for my NAS and keep it running if the power flickers. Both of the UPS's that I'm looking at are in my price range, and my main concern is buying one that has less of a chance of catching on fire.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to set up a Collabora server instance via Docker compose, and as of right now, I'm only doing everything locally and using IP.Addy.No:Port for accessing my services. However, all of the guides I can find online seem to require using a reverse proxy and a domain name to get Collabora working. Everything I've been able to find says that using localhost doesn't work.
 Does anyone know of any useful resources for connecting a Collabora server in a docker container with a Nextcloud instance in a separate container without using reverse proxies and domains? (I eventually do want to get into reverse proxies, but I'm doing this a little bit at a time, trying to get the most pertinent services up and running first) I am very new to Docker and running server services, so I haven't been able to make the logical leap over the gray area in all of the current guides I've seen.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was copying files from one drive to the Seagate drive in question (so I don't care about getting the data from that - I just want it working so then I can copy to it again). My computer completely froze (I was doing another copy with 2 other drives at the same time - those ones are fine though, funnily enough) and had no choice but to restart it during the copy.
 The main source drive was fine (thank goodness!) but the Segate 5TB not so much. I don't think it's a mechanical failure (in the platter / read/write head sense) - it spins fine, no beeping or any unusual sounds. But when I plug it in, it disconnects after a few seconds. When opening disk management on windows, it shows "Unknown Not initialized" for a split second. Given the circumstances of the failure, faulty cables wouldn't be a thing - although I tried different ones anyway to be doubly sure. So clearly some hardware issue, but I doubt mechanical - so I opened up the ensure (without snapping the clips somehow, lol).
 I put the hard drive inside a spare enclosure. Plugged it in - it didn't disconnect, but it wasn't showing up normally. I go on disk management, and I can see again "Unknown Not initialized". Again, I don't care about getting data from this, so I right-clicked on "initialize". It says "The request failed due to a fatal device hardware error." So definitely software will not work whatsoever. This leads me to believe I fried the control board / PCB, which provides an interface for the mechanical drive to communicate with the computer. Thus, I can't access the drive.
 The model of the PCB is 100721570 REV E.
 Am I correct in surmising that this is a PCB failure, and that I simply need to buy a replacement (AliExpress seems to be the only place I can buy this)? And apparently I need to copy the BIOS firmware from my original PCB to the replacement - is that true?
 Or is it really a mechanical failure?

This is a big issue that I am trying to solve in priority as it's hindering my progress for deploying more modems and opening more ports.
 I am looking into 2 options here, either I can make an pfsence router myself or get something off the shelf like dream machine pro. I'm from India and getting server hardware here is a big pain in the butt. So I was thinking to go with dream machine pro.
 So does anyone know about how many port forwarding rules can we create in dream machine pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, thanks for reading -
 I'm in the UK and have been looking at reducing my power usage - I ditched my r710 last year and went back to 2 Gen8 microservers and things have been fine so far.
 I really wanted a Pi just for Pihole/DHCP/VPN etc but the prices and availability just made that a non-starter so I set about a little project.
 Dug out an RK3188 Android box out of a drawer (Chipset：RK3318 Quad-Core 64bit Cortex-A53) (4cpu @ 1.296 GHz) - it no longer functions as an android box as Armbian is installed directly to the eMMC. 
 Both Wi-Fi and LAN working (no Bluetooth or audio though but not needed for this use case as a network utility). GPU solid (GUI/Desktop performance more than enough, actually quite good) 
 Currently running:
 SSH Server Pi-hole Pi-VPN Samba Sonarr Radarr Docker, and Transmission. 
 Once configured for my LAN (used desktop GUI connected to a monitor with keyboard & mouse and a bit of SSH), it only needs the psu connected before logging in via SSH - GUI/Display output still working incase its needed though. 
 The power draw/cpu usage while idling are very low and even with all of those services running in the background - ram usage 815mb out of 3973Mb and System load of 5%. The best part for me is the power draw, which sits idle at about 4-5W. 
 I have photos of resource usage - neofetch, htop and the info given when logging in to the terminal - I'll make an imgur album if there's enough interest :) 
 It's taken me the best part of this weekend to do this - if there is enough interest let me know and I'll get some up on r/homelabsales if that's something that's allowed. 
 Thanks for reading 🙏

 I’m beyond upset. I lost photos of my father who passed away, my old pets, my whole life. I recently spent so much time downloading all of stuff from google and the like and kept this hard drive close like gold. Now it’s gone.
 I doubt anything can be done, but I’m just venting. What an absolute kick in the gut. I’m devastated.
 Edit: you’re probably wondering about backups- I had Duplicati set up to backup my whole server once a week to an S3 bucket but apparently it’s just been making empty buckets. I was too trusting of the notifications to try to look for myself. 
 There is no backup of this drive because of this, and I am aware it’s my fault.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 UK user.... I currently run an entry level Netgear ReadyNAS which is approaching near 10yrs old and is mainly used for "cold storage" and an i3 NUC as my mini-server / media centre, again that's nearing 10 yrs. I've had both from new and they have been brilliant but the media centre is starting to play up and I'm thinking it about time I start thinking about changing both into one combined machine with new drives. 
 My needs are not that heavy but ideally I would like to go down the TrueNAS Scale route with a 4U, 4-8HDD hot swap, short server style setup but I'm really struggling to put a decent combination of HW together to match the value for money of the QNAP TS-473A which would also meet my needs. 
 Further there is space, noise and consumption challenges with the server compares to the QNAP which further add to the cost to compensate. I don't know if the server style approach is more romantic than reality and if I should just bite the bullet with the QNAP and call it a day (despite my reservations on their poor poor security record). 
 My best HW combination so far is as below to keep the NAS under £900 (excl HDDs/SSDs):
 Motherboard: Asrock X570 Pro 4 - £170
 CPU - Ryzen 5 Pro 5650G - £150
 Memory - 32GB ECC - £150
 Server Case - 4U - £190
 PSU - Crosair - 550W - £100
 Various Noctua Fans + Ancilliaries - £120 
 ​
 In comparison the QNAP comes in at £750 + £100 for a RAM upgrade to 32GB ECC. Granted the server is a little more powerful but has other complexities...
 What HW would you go with to justify the server over the QNAP?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In 2 days, my domain name will expire. If i renew it at the same place i bough it, will i have to renew the ssl wildcart cert and all the .pem and crap like this to something else. 
 I bought it last year at ionos and they were offering free ssl wildcart cert with each domain name purchased. Installalling them was a nightmare under debain server with proxmox running under the hood. I was starting from 0 and ask a lot of information everywhere to achieve 100% what i want at this moment.
 I went on the website to renew my order and i would like to know how much it will cost, I can't see how much money i need to prepare with taxes and how much money i need to get for the ssl sert / domain guard and renewal of the domain name. 
 I dont feel for renewing the files physically to something else. Can i avoid this part for the next 5 years to something else and mess with my website access security. i had problem making them works with the information i was seeing last time.

 The audio hats for the Pis have just been updated, apparently. Does anyone know of projects that could be installed on a pi and used with this for whole home audio? 
 I found this post which mentions a few projects but wanted to run it by this sub, first. https://www.reddit.com/r/RASPBERRY_PI_PROJECTS/comments/lnhqpc/is_there_a_good_way_to_multiroom_audio_in_2021
 My preference is to be able to use Google casting, but if I had to use another solution, that's fine. 
 My main source for audio is Airsonic, though as the project is old and older now I may have to move to Jellyfin. I have tried Navidrome and generally find it inferior to Airsonic, with very little interest in using it as my main player. 
 My goal would be to be able to queue up music from my phone to play in various rooms throughout the house. 
 I like the ability to control each room's volume from my phone (like Google home, however their multi room audio has been terrible since they lost the Sonos lawsuit. I don't even bother with it anymore) as well as toggling rooms on and off. If it was possible to send different streams to different rooms simultaneously, that would be incredible. 
 Lastly I might be interested in Home Assistant integration, though it's not a requirement. The companion app is okay, but maybe not where I'd want to be managing everything from. 
 Obviously this is a big wish list, but I'd be curious to hear what you all are doing?

 I noticed backfilling to redistribute data to the new drive was going very slow, and after a long search as to why, I noticed the drive was not acting "normal" compared to the other 11 drives in this machine. It had partitions that shouldn't have been there, and it seemed to be somehow re-initializing all the time based on seeing the partitions get reported in dmesg frequently. I marked it out of the cluster and began troubleshooting.
 After trying other identical drives in the same machine, trying other slots, and trying these drives in one of the other R720XDs I have with identical config (h710 in IT mode), it seems it's so…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a newbie and I am planning on building a self-hosted NAS system for home use for the first time. After some research, I am thinking of buying a RaspberryPi4 (4GB), attaching an external SSD via USB, and installing OpenMediaVault on it. These are my requirements:
  
I need data durability
 I need data encryption
 I need to read/write data from various OSes (Windows, MacOS, Linux)
  
Would this setup cover all my points above? I am mostly worried about data durability. I guess I can plug in a secondary SSD and backup my data every now and then. But how do I prevent data corruption/bitrot in the long run? Please also let me know if you would recommend different hardware/software.
 For the sake of completeness: I don’t need to stream movies, I don’t need to store a lot of data (256GB is more than enough), and I don’t need high availability (in fact, I only intend to boot the system every now and then).
 Thanks!

 A local shop has these used HGST 6TB HUS726060ALA640 drives for $40 a piece. The power on time shows around 2500 days and health 100%.
 The use case would be a TrueNAS server and the drives would be in ZFS RAID 6 or raidz2 (whatever they call it). I would have another backup of the files stored on another machine on 2 larger drives in mirror.
 I am wondering if this is a good deal or if I should stay away? What would you do?

 I’d prefer Nvidia for the software compatibility but it doesn't have to be. I need it to at least match the gaming performance of an RTX 2070. It also has to fit in a r730xd so it can’t be super massive. I can use server GPUs or consumer GPUs. If it’s a consumer GPU I believe it has to be a blower model (that pushes air out the back).
 I’m having trouble deciphering the nvidia server GPU naming scheme, and there are minimal user benchmarks submitted for server GPUs so I really have no idea what I’m looking at. From other posts I've read it sounds like server GPUs aren't great for gaming. But used parts can be at such large discounts that it may be worth it, I don't know.
 If anyone can recommend me a good GPU that fits in an R730/R730XD I would appreciate it.

 I currently own a nas that runs multiple dockers but I'd like to go futher. My raspberry 3b isn't quite adapted lol. 
 I'd like use this machine for pfsense, and some other vms / docker images that I still haven't decided about. 
 Thanks for your time !

 I could also set up multiple of such events. Some that just look up the weather in the morning before my alarm and tells me to take an umbrella if rain is forecasted.
 I can program all of this myself with eg. Selenide, but I'd rather use a solution that's already available to save time.
 Does something like this exist? I'm cool with it if it requires writing scripts as well

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I have a crashplan for small business subscription and I need help in understanding the difference in sizes of my backup sets as they are presented in the:
 - Windows App
 - web application
 On windows App I see the "predefined" backup set occupying 3.1 TB while on the web application I see the (I guess) overall size at 2.4 TB (with a Selected at 2.9 TB that I don't know the meaning).
 Do you know why?
 ​
 ​
 on windows application
 ​
 ​
 on web application
 ​
 Second question: I bought a new bigger drive since the one where a part of my "predefined" backup set of Crashplan is filling up.
 Of course i need to migrate the files without reuploading everything to the cloud.
 May I safely refer to the guide here under the "Replace a drive" section?
 https://support.crashplan.com/hc/en-us/articles/8887084769037-Back-up-external-hard-drives-using-CrashPlan-for-Small-Business
 I found it not very clear for such a life critical task.
 Do anyone knows what I have to after connecting the new (empty) drive (a 6TB wd red)?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day all,
 I have a lab and I'm interested in expanding my ProxMox cluster to include a shared-storage option to make VM migrations fast.
 Setup:
 I have 3 matching systems (PX1, PX2, PX3) that currently have 500GB SSD drives in each. Running ProxMox 7.1.7.
 I have read much about Ceph, and also have Truenas option. I have done test migrations between PX systems, but these transfers take a while running 1GB Ethernet. I would like to add a shared storage cluster so the VMs will move faster.
 Do you recommend a Truenas ZFS external machine? Ceph on Ubuntu? I've also seen the Ceph setup inside ProxMox video that looks like it wants 3 matching drives, one dedicated for each PX system.
 What does the group recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I finally installed the new Google Drive app. It's definitely an improvement over the old Backup and Sync, however there's one thing I am unclear on, and I can't find the answer anywhere.
 You have the option to mirror certain folders from your computer. All Google says is that it will keep files and folders the same in both places. What I interpret this to mean is, while syncing is happening, it will keep track of where changes are made and then make the same changes in the other place. If you add a file on your computer, it adds it to the cloud. If you delete a file in the cloud, it deletes it from your computer. It knows where the change is made, and makes the same change in the other place.
 But what if I turn off syncing for 2 months, then I delete 2 files from my computer's folder, then 3 months later I turn on syncing again. How is Google Drive going to know whether files have been deleted from my local storage or added to Drive? Is it going to add the files back to my local storage or is it going to delete them from Drive? What will it use as reference?
 In the old Backup and Sync, there were options where you could tell it what to do in these scenarios. I messed up once and after moving a whole bunch of files from a mirrored folder while it wasn't being synced, I then resubscribed to Drive and it re-added all of those files, and now that folder is a complete mess, 2 years later I still haven't fixed it. I wanna make sure this doesn't happen again, but in the new app there are no settings to set a behavior for when it discovers changes that were made while syncing was off.
 Thanks, any input is appreciated.

 I've been using a Raspberry 3 as my media server since a while and everything was fine. 
 Sadly, some kind of power surge fried the board yesterday and it's at the worst period. I'm really short of options.
 Do you have a suggestion of what alternative SBC I could use as a media server? 
 I have a simple setup and simple needs:
  
Kodi
 HDMI out composite which 
 gets to a box which splits audio via optical output to my audio decoder and video through HDMI to my beamer
 
 the box will only be on when I'll be watching a movie, so basically 4-5 times / week for 2 hours maximum (I don't watch TV).
  
Thank you for your input

 Might be a silly question, but I'm not sure how this actually works.
 I currently self-host a Jellyfin that is also publicly exposed (with dense security) for the few cases where I need to use it from outside.
 It is being a domain name and is sent to my home through a VPS (no open port) (so the domain name points to the VPS IP).
 If I access this from my internal network, will the routing be smart enough to not go through the internet and directly re-route to my internal website, or will it still go through the VPS therefore being subject to my internet speeds ups and downs ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do I image Windows OS for recovery ? I currently know about macrium reflect but it does not support cloud backup. The laptop has active internet connection but lacks in storage space so I prefer to backup directly to cloud. Restoring won't be an issue as I will use 2nd PC to download the backup prior to restore. Any suggestions ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Goal is to use nginx Proxy Manager to reach different webservices under the same domain name on different ports. In this case I need a reverse proxy for vaultwarden to have Let's Encrypt certificate.
 From a WAN address I would like to reach my Vaultwarden Docker with https certificate by using a subfolder if that's possible.
 E.g. when opening https://home.mydomain.com/vw I'd like to reach my Vaultwarden which listens to port 7010 which is mapped to 443 within the container.
 This is what I've tried, without luck...
 Domain (Dynamic DNS): home.mydomain.com
 All docker containers are deployed with Portainer.
 Vaultwarden: IP 192.168.3.50 Port 7010 mapped to 443 inside container and 7011 -> 80.
 nginx Proxy Manager: IP 192.168.3.50, Port 80,81,443
 I've tried this Proxy Host config in npm Source: home.mydomain.com Destination: http://192.168.3.50:80 Block common exploits, Websocket Support SSL certificate assigned (Lets Encrypt), Force SSL, HTTP/2 Support
 with different custom locations:
 1) Custom location: /vw Destination: http://192.168.3.50:7011
 When opening http://home.mydomain.com/vw from a WAN adress I get a 404 "bitwarden...Page not found!..." page. I can load the bitwarden login page from the local network using http://192.168.3.50:7011 
 2) Custom location: /vw Destination: https://192.168.3.50:7010
 When opening https://home.mydomain.com/vw from a WAN adress I get 502 Bad Gateway....openresty

And all the over sees camera always seem to use the same softwareso there has to be some open source project i have not yet discovered.. Look what happened to ring. That was home made but it costs a pretty penny lol.
 From a quick search I see esp32 projects but I'm wondering what else is out there.
 Long story short when I'm at an airbnb or traveling I'd like a camera to watch the entrances or valuables. A propped up tablet is just too obvious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On windows explorer when I go searching through my hdd, theres a long pause on every folder as it scans and builds a directory file tree from scratch every single time. 
 These folders haven’t changed in months, maybe years, theres no need to rebuild it so often.
 Is there a software / hardware combo that will place all the filenames and directories on a dedicated NVME for instant browsing? And then do a minor delta update as things change?
 I’m ok with the actual hdd files themselves being slow and taking a while to load.
 Thanks in advance

The upload process is amazing from my Pixel 6 but the viewing process is laggy. And Facial Recognition completely broke in Nextcloud 25. My hardware is underpowered either, I have an i5-8250u running just nextcloud and a 3 player minecraft server.
 ​
 Every one of my services is authenticated with LDAP, if OAUTH is available that also works since I run Authelia (planning to switch to keycloak in the near future). It also needs to work entirely in a browser.
 I have checked a lot of the go-to image viewers with facial recognition and none of them seem to support LDAP login... some don't even support proper user authentication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I will be getting a new server (pre-built) in a few weeks and I would like to know a few things before I make that purchase official.
 Server specs:
  
Form factor: Tower
 RAM: 32 GB (4x 8GB) DDR4
 PSU: 1x 900W Hot plug, 80 plus gold
 CPU: 2x E5-2650v3 or 2x E5-2690v3
 OS: Ubuntu Server 22.04.1 LTS
  
Usage:
  
Running 24/7
 Personal cloud storage for films, videos, photos and other media.
 Running small website.
 Maybe some Minecraft modded server for playing with friends.
 Virtualization for testing but also daily using.
  
Cost: 601.99$ (2x E5-2650v3) or 759.02$ (2x E5-2690v3)
 - I would like to know how many cores do I need for server? I tried searching the Internet for some charts but didn't find anything useful.
 - Is Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 better or worse than Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is kind of a generic question, but I'm seeking advice for best way to secure a VPS (recently picked up a pretty beefy VPS for cheap on cyber monday). 
 So the issue I am running into is that when you install docker and deploy an image with the -p option, it's creating a related rule in nftables (running Debian 11). My original plan was to throw down ufw, forward only 80/443 and reverse proxy things I wanted publicly exposed (very little), and everything else would only accessible via wireguard. 
 I setup wireguard, got that working and everything then deployed a syncthing docker (to backup certain files from an on-prem box). I didn't create a rule in ufw for the UI, yet I was able to browse to it and that's when I starting researching and learned that -p option was creating those nft rules. This is not what I want; I want the syncthing UI to only be available to my clients connected to this VPS with wireguard, but I'm not sure how to achieve this. 
 Any suggestions? How are you running dockers on a VPS without exposing it all on the internet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having an issue where I hadn't used some of my subdomains for some time with nextcloud. I have been using a duckdns link for when my public IP changed. Now I am getting warnings about some certificates expiring and I've found that none of subdomains I've had for years now with Google are working however my duckdns link is still accessing nextcloud properly and when I use a browser to try the subdomains I'm getting that "congratulations you've successfully started the Nginx Proxy Manager". So if from a browser off my LAN my duckdns link is working what is causing my subdomains to not load. For example b***.***server.com and *****.duckdns.org both go to nextcloud but only duckdns loads it. 
 Thanks in advance for any help!!

I know I could use vpn or Tailscale but they are unable to install apps on their machines for one reason or another. So I’d like to open it up. I understand the risks etc. 
 I do own a domain name from an old website I used to run. It would be cool to use the domain from it It’s no longer indexed via google. I have Xfinity internet. 
 I did some researching and it seems that cloudflare tunnels would work but I can’t seem to figure it out. I think I set my dns up wrong from google to cloudflare. Idk
 Anyway is there a tutorial for this? Like something that’s detailed and step by step lol. I’m dumb I guess.

 I switched to Jellyfin a while back after having a minidlna based setup, because I fell in love with the UI. However it has so many bugs which go ignored by the devs, it's becoming more of a pain than a joy to use.
 What are people using for self-hosted movie collections? My other-half has gotten used to the netflix-style ui of Jellyfin, so something similar is high on the list of reqs!
 Cheers!

 Online I found some stuff about a DMZ, but it mostly mentions a separate host that isn’t physically connected to your internal network. 
 I have proxmox connected to an Omada switch, and then to my pfSense firewall…can I create a VLAN that blocks traffic from my internal network and put that on the VM? So I can connect to the VM from inside my network, but it’s only one way. 
 I know that using WireGuard makes it safer than port forwarding, but just trying to not wake up and my NAS and other servers are owned 😂. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[​
 So I got my new to me S3500 switches. They came with a single 1050w power supply. 
 That thing is LOUD! I mean, I run older R710s and that noise is ok. Some of you prefer dead silent and that's ok, but I personally don't mind a bit of background white noise. 
 But these 1050s are on another level! My first thought was to fan mod it, but with the amount of heat coming out of that thing even with the switch idle makes me think it would overheat rather rapidly. The main fans in the switch slow down considerably after boot and they don't seem too bad. Of course, I can't really tell for sure with the PSU fan blasting away. 
 So looking around it looks like Aruba specified both 600w and 1050w power supplies for this switch. I have also seen mention of 350w power supplies in a couple of posts. However they don't appear in the datasheet for the S3500 so my assumption is they don't have enough power output.
 So for those of you that have run S3500s, is the 600w PSU a lot quieter than the 1050?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I was going to deploy some new docker container some of them are using Mariadb, now I thought why not deploy one mariadb container for all of them?
 Before doing that I wanted to ask, would it even noticeable save resources? Or will I introduce other disadvantages to my setup?
 If not what would be the best way to deploy it?
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a complete beginner when it comes to technology, and I really need your help because I genuinely don't understand specs.
 I'm getting an external hard drive for a laptop that doesn't have room for an internal hard drive. I'm trying to pick the most reliable and best of them.
  
Basic Portable Drive 2 TB
 Toshiba Canvio Ready
 Toshiba Canvio Basics
  
Finally, I have one more option - buying this docking station to connect one of the internal HDDs (links below) to my laptop - I'm not sure if this is a good alternative or if it's reliable at all. 
  
Toshiba P300 Desktop PC
 WD Blue PC Desktop Hard Drive
  
I apologize if this is a stupid and bothersome question, but as a girl (who knows very little about tech and) is looking for a good photo and video storage solution, I hope you won't mind helping me with this.

So lets say I have 50 orders to be delivered to 50 customers at 50 different locations... what I want to achieve is to automatically group orders and assign them to drivers, so drivers will deliever multiple orders on 1 go (like if the locations are near each other).
 Any systems you think of that I can use or tweak or use as a starting point to achieve this?
 Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was given a Watchguard XTM 8 (no CF card) some time ago, and it’s been collecting dust. Prior to that, I made a pfSense box (working LCD with lcdproc, etc.) on a XTM 5 which I then sold. I was able to flash a custom bios to my XTM 5 which allowed the pfSense install. My hope was to make another pfSense box out of this XTM 8, but I seem to remember some sort of issue with the serial port in doing this. 
 My question is this: Is there any practical use for this in my homelab? Is it possible to flash a custom BIOS that would allow me to repurpose this as a Linux box or is it a boat anchor?

 What I want is low powered, easily configured and gigabit ports. 
 I currently don't have gigabit internet but I'm on a 300mb plan. I really don't want to spend money on electricicity running a dedicated computer. 
 All I really see are tp-link, ubiquiti and mikrotik? Which I've never heard of.
 Is the tplink er605 or 7206 decent and easy to use?
 Or like an ubiquiti edgerouter X ? 
 Nothing crazy expensive as we mainly use internet for heavy streaming and daughter does school work and xbox gaming. And I find stuff to fill up plex lol.

 DirectUs Contentful Contentstack Storyblok Sanity Strapi Webiny Payload CMS
 I decided for solutions which are self hosted, and also have options (ideally to publish pages and basic SEO). I have now landed on Webiny and Payload (taking into account self hosted and pricing - otcourse payload wins here).
 Webiny - they clarified on their security (firewall, code security scans), they support multi site, and also have a page builder - that are some strong plus points. And they aren't too expensive for users.
 Payload - of course free, but I see nothing about security and its too developer dependent (good for something's, but not if I want some content guys to run independent fast)
 My requirements: will be building a product comparison web platform, that will scale really fast in terms of visitors. And I will decide on hiring freelance developers, once I close on this.. But will also discuss with my devs later on the solution.
 Inherent Security, Multi Site / Language, User Authentication, Page Builder / Form Builder / File Manager, SEO
 Would be great if I can hear about people who are using these.

 I'm planning a 6 drive (storage) truenas build + 1 ssd for the OS drive.
 My mobo has 6 sata ports and so consequently, I'm one short. 
 To utilise my 6 sata ports for the 6 data drives. I understand there is the option to boot the OS from USB (converted to Sata). Alternatively, I could look to get an HBA card (pci express --> sata) but hear there are compatibility issues via this route. If you know of a good HBA card thats not too expensive, I'd love to hear.
 Any guidance here would be appreciated!

The Topton box (on bottom) is meant to run Proxmox and pfSense and be directly connected to the cable modem, but will live inside until setup and tested. One switch outside, and one switch inside the pfSense firewall. Also outside the picture, a Netgear GSS116E, two workstations, and a passel of the usual devices - meant to be well-isolated.
 Need to spend more time with pfSense and Proxmox.
 Have assorted DIN-mount gadgets and Meanwell power supplies. Also a couple of 3D printers. Might lose the wall-warts, and fabricate DIN mounts for the smaller network gadgets.
 Need to sort the mess of wires, and find a (much!) better mount.
 Again ... just a start. :)

I'm fairly technically capable, Linux is my favourite OS, I play with r-pi's a fair amount and I code in various languages - these days mostly code Python with a little C++. Run a few servers at home, love the command line, and have experience with cloud computing. With that said, I'm a bit of a jack of all trades but master of non but not afraid of the unknown.
 I instantly loved the flexibility of OHAB and was wary of the easy to use for non-technical people focus of home assistant. However, the java backend of HA makes me worry. Sorry if this is stupid but in the past I've had jvm version conflicts with stuff and am a bit wary of that but I don't really know if that is relevant. Do I need to even worry about that with HA?
 Additionally, whilst I love flexibility and tinkering, my current work is very full on so I don't actually have that much spare time so maybe "easy to use but less flexible" is better for me these days??
 Does anybody have any experience and words of advice?
 Finally, is there a good place where people talk about and share smart home setups and configs etc?

I have a really fast internet (5gbit/s), but the softwares that I tried (4K video downloaded and Open Video Downloader) are slow, like 3 MB/s for 4k video download and 1MB/s for Oen video downloader. I founded some online websites with a lot of stupid ads, like https://x2download.app/ , that download at a really fast speed, but they aren’t good for download more than few videos at once. What do you use? I have both windows, Linux and Mac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, So recently I have up-scaled my homelab from 4 docker containers/VMs to 15, and the expansion is only going to grow. I am having a lot of fun but I am also losing track of configurations and I would love to have some sort of centralized place to edit YAML files with a change history of sorts, to revert changes if I made an error. (currently I copy/paste into a new file, then use that if I need to revert back...)
 The YAML files are mainly on a private share for containers, that I access though my workstation, however I do have other services running outside of docker.
 I have netbox to keep track of IP's/Ports and so on, I have my documentation in order. However I do not have a good way to edit YAML files from a centralized area, and track changes or have a changelog. 
 I am very new to code, and code tracking, is there any container/service that I could use for this? Maybe Visual Studio? - I do not know if this will have what I need. 
 Thanks!

 I am in the process of backing up a complete music library from a website (+- 10000 albums).
 Here are always 2 options to download a flac and mp3 version. When the files are being downloaded individually they have always the same name whithout knowing if you have downloaded the flac or mp3 version.
 Filename.rar (contains 1 mp3 album)
 Filename.rar (contains 1 flac album)
 by using jdownloader 2 i always download both and append a number
 Filename.rar
 Filename_2.rar
 But i still do not know if the archive contains mp3 or flac.
 Is there any piece of software that can open the archive, see what extensions the songs have and append this to the filename?
 Filename.rar -> Filename_flac.rar
 Filename_2.rar -> Filename_2_mp3.rar

 Thanks!

 At the moment it's not much but it will get better.
 I got 10G fiber from my ISP with one full IPv4 and a /64 IPv6.
 My goal is to bring back at home my small server that is on a VM at OVH.
 I got 2 sff pc that I'll use for training and hosting.
 My switch is an old 15 year old 16 port Netgear. But I got an Aruba 1930 24 port on its way, so I can use the SFP+ port on my ISP router.
 Then next step will be to replace my hacked up firewall by a 10G capable one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There were a set of fairly cheap 1U GPU servers (the 1027GR line) on eBay a little while ago, one of which I picked up. I've been tearing my hair out for a few weeks trying to figure out exactly how to control the fans on these things; there's a lot of people out there with instructions on how to generically control fans on SMC servers with ipmitool and some people have details for X9 boards. In particular this STH article/discussion was very helpful indeed.
 ​
 I do think it's worth reading that comment and the original reference guide so I won't go into detail here, but what I did want to add was that the 1027GR seems to have unusual ID's for its zones. Specifically everyone usually says that the CPU zone is 0x00 and any additional cooling zones are 0x01, 0x02, etc. but on this server, (or at least mine) the zones aren't that at all. The zones for controlling the fans on my 1027GR-TR are the following:
  
0x10: CPU Zone
 0x12: Left GPU Zone
 0x13: Right GPU Zone
  
I know it's not the most useful post but I just wanted this to be out there for the next person searching around. Save them a bit of time and maybe keep them from tossing the server they bought because they can't get it quiet enough to use.

 Does anybody know how to go about making 1 80tb volume? I’d rather not pass the drives directly to the 1st host due to wanting to utilize the second host for processing power along with storage. 
 I’m using Windows Server Datacenter 2019 for my host OS (yes yes I know, it’s just so easy to join them to my ADDC and create permissions extremely easy).
 My initial thought was to use iscsi to pass the drives over a dedicated 1Gb link (no connection to the host would be more than 1Gb anyway) and just add them to the pool that way. Unless you guys have a better solution? Was thinking maybe clustering but it seems that you only get mirroring and not striping.

 First of all, sorry for my bad englisch german native here :) 
 I have a question about ZFS-Replication, perhaps someone have some infos.
 I have a Main-Storage System with ZFS and ECC RAM, the Second-Storage-System is running ZFS without ECC.
 In my opinion it's ok to run the second storage system without ECC, because the Main System have.
 The Second System is only for storing zfs-snapshot-replication as Backup
 Since i'm safe against bit root on my main storage after the data are writen to disk there is no chance to transfer corrupted data on my second storage system even without ecc on the second system.
 If i have a bit-root in ram on the second system while replication, zfs would check the different parity and resend it.
 Do I have a flaw in my thinking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 I want let you know that I have just released Update 1.6 for OpenBudgeteer, a budgeting app based on the Bucket Budgeting Principle. The Update contains some new features, optimizations and a few fixes. Check out the Changelog for the full list of changes. Below some highlights of the new update:
 Recurring Transactions & Split:
 It's now possible to manually split a Bank Transaction for multiple Buckets. In addition, if the amount assigned to a Bucket is lower than the Transaction itself, the remaining amount is displayed. Creation of Recurring Transactions has been added too. This is useful if you mainly add your Bank Transactions manually instead of importing txt/csv files.
 Themes:
 Themes are now supported. Visit Bootswatch for more details. To select a theme use the new option APPSETTINGS_THEME as docker environment variable or in the appsettings.json file.
 Import Page Redesign:
 Import page got some slight redesign. You can now switch between all steps in an accordion view, where each section is enabled depending on your input.
 As usual any kind of feedback is highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I finally got back into the data hoarding game and got myself a new 16TB WD Element this past Black Friday. I have not shucked it and it is connected via USB 3. Benchmarks and file transfers show performance to be as advertised but I’m having an issue interacting with it in Explorer. I have SABnzbd set to transfer the ISOs after processing and I see the write rate to be > 200 MB/s along with other file transfer actions.
 Whenever I try to right-click and view properties on any folder and file on the drive, it takes > 5 or so seconds before the right-click menu comes up and another > 30 or so seconds before the info window comes up. Browsing is also a touch slower compared to my older and far smaller external drives.
 I tried leaving it as the only connected device, disabling shell menu extensions, Windows Search, services, and startup items and nothing has worked. The only time that the drive and Explorer don’t exhibit this issue is when I boot into Safe Mode. The drive functions as expected with right-clicking and retrieving folder and file properties as instantaneous.
 Other Explorer alternatives like Files doesn’t exhibit the same issue either so it definitely seems like a Windows issue.
 Anyone else has seen this behavior and might have an insight into this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have around 5TB worth of data that I want to consolidate into one place and want to know how would I go around and do such a thing.
 Short backstory, I had a system with 2 drives, a 500GB SSD and 2TB HDD. Bought a 1TB HDD during start of the pandemic for recording location of recorded meetings. Year 1 into Pandemic, 2TB HDD has an error and on a "Caution" status from CrystalDiskInfo. I was also planning to build a new rig that year so I bought one 1TB NVME SSD(not part of the situation), a 2TB Ironwolf HDD and 4TB Barracuda.
 I didn't want to use my new drives on the PC so I used two 1TB External HDDs to store the data. Then a year later the 1TB I bought at the start of the pandemic was in "Bad" condition, so I gave in and plugged my 4TB HDD and transferred my files. For some reason I also plugged in the 2TB HDD. Now all of them are in use. 
 So I did a disk analyze using WizTree and found out that I have half of my total storage full, not to mention earlier in the day I got an error that there was not enough space in my boot drive when I was saving stuff into there. 
 Now how would I go around completely copying over these files into a whole separate drive/drives, eliminating duplicates and make sure everything is copied properly, so that I can completely wipe my current system and basically start from scratch.
 I would also like to ask on what kind of storage I should use to store this on. I think it will be just a cold storage, with the occasional rummage through, but it might also be another dump place I can continue adding to. I don't want to delete any of the files, more of its a hassle rather than sentimental stuff, but there are stuff that I definitely want to keep there. I would also say that I don't have much money to put towards storing these. So I guess a solution where I can add on over time would be best.

Any recommendations? 
 I am looking for a per socket basis since I want to monitor power draw of each of my devices and create a dashboard. Ultimately my goal is to correlate power consumption to load and determine the best node to send work tasks to, with the aim to minimize power usage.

 After setting up yet another laptop, I've had the idea of creating a small solution to be able to: 1. Install new devices from an image I created 2. Install software remotely 3. Remotely connecting to the devices when my "users" need help with anything that requires me to see their screen.
 I'm already pretty set on using AnyDesk for #3, but I haven't yet found a clean, easy (and free/inexpensive) solution for the first two points. I know of OPSI, but from everything I know it's complicated to set up and would require me to implement a VPN for all the client devices.
 Do any of you know of any software that could help me achieve my goal? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you!

Because im behind Carrier Grade NAT i cant just expose a port to the internet and be done with it. Also struggled with other solutions like using gluetun to route it through a Port forwarded from Mullvad(VPN Provider)
 It was a breeze to setup their Documentation is 100% on point i didnt have to quess anything or spend time googling configuration examples and i was done with it in like half an hour and its running great ever since.
 Only snag i hit is that you have to get the tailscale package from their unstable branch because the funnel features are not on stable branch yet.
 I really hope they dont go down the same route as cloudflared and banning media from the service

 TLDR:
 I think that somehow port/channel 3 on the first port of my LSI 9240-8i is bad. Swapping breakout cable results in the same sata port being bad.
 Has anyone else ever seen this type of failure mode? Is there a recommended way to test all the channels/ports on it?
 Key system info:
  
It's been up and happy for over a year.
 I'm using a LSI 9240-8i in IT mode as an HBA

 I purchased a Storinator Q30 case and are looking to buy components for it ( CPU, RAM and MB)
 I have 2 * lsi 16i cards and an 10gbe card that will be put into the computer aswell.
 Storage i have 5*10tb and 5*18tb with 20 more slots in the case empty, so a build that can handle all the pcie lanes ( im counting 20 lanes) 
 Was thinking to get an ASUS PRIME Z690-P D4 (DDR4) and Intel Core i9-12900 together with 128gb ram but not sure thats the best path to take? read that QSV is favored because of plex and HW transcoding
 The OS im going to be using for this build is going to be Unraid as im going to run some stuff besides plex. nothing that cpu heavy. ( pihole, *arr´s, grafana. etc) and were wondering if you guys could give me suggestions of what path would be the best to take. cost wise, not really any limits.
 ​
 thanks in advice!

 The worry is the availability of a reader 10 years down the line in order to transfer the data onto something newer.
 The issue is I'm on budget and I just can't buy a NAS with data redundancy RAID and stuff right now. About half if not more of my data isn't changing so it might work if I go with write once disks.
 If I do choose this option ... I have lots of HDDs already, I'd like to know some more details about Blu-Ray in terms of reliability, like DVDs would randomly get bad sectors no matter how well you cared about them (or maybe I just had cheap disks?) I would get 1 broken disk per 10 disks in a brand new fresh DVD pack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I want to finally upgrade from my current system (Z87-G45 motherboard, Intel 4770k, 32GB DDR3) and build a new system. 
 I also want to stop paying for Dropbox and have my own NAS that replicates that functionality as well as be a media server to stream my owned content. 
 So, I was thinking of just reusing my current system for the NAS, but here are the drawbacks from my understanding: 1 GB Ethernet on motherboard, no built-in WIFI, and no NVME slots (does have MSATA though). 
 I could buy a 10G LAN card (100 dollars) as well as an adapter card (15?) to be able to use an NVME drive for caching. Or, I could sell the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and AIO combo and use that money to build the cheapest newish system using a motherboard that has at least a 2.5G LAN port. 
 I have never built a server nor have had any kind of network storage before, so this is all a new experience for me. 
 What would you do or recommend me do?
 Any advice would be appreciated, including which OS/software system to use!!!

Additionally when I’m connected to the switch via Ethernet through my laptop, which I have manually set it’s ipv4 address in the 192.168.1.0/24 range, it is able to see all other connections on the switch but unable to see anything connected to the network.
 At the this point, I’m not sure what happened. Any advice is helpful but from what I’ve seen, these devices tend to have this issue.
 Also I did verify the subnet mask and ensured that the static IP I set was in range.

My original network was [Technicolor modem > Netgear Nighthawk router] and now I would like it to be [modem > switch > AP]. When I do this however, I can't access the switch or AP because I don't have an Ethernet port to route through the switch. It does broadcast an SSID but I have no clue what the password is. To get around this, I setup [Modem > Router > Switch > AP], setup a Unifi Console and got everything working. I then tried to remove the router with the now configured OS console, but when I do this it continues broadcasting the SSID I setup and the password is correct, but it won't let me connect back to the AP unless I have the router plugged in. It just says it's connected, obtaining IP, then disconnects like it was never even trying (Android). Any idea why I can't bypass the router once the new AP is configured?

 About half a month ago, a friend sent me a link to a heated discussion on reddit. So I found the reddit self-hosted forum, and there were many comments about memos. The most mentioned one was dark mode, so we did our best to make a usable and readable version of dark mode.
 👇 Here is the new version of memos with dark mode. Please enjoy.
 Dark mode in memos v0.8.1
 BTW. Personally, I really like services that support self-hosted, like trilium, mastodon and so on. From the first day when I created the repo of memos, I decided that it should be permanently free and open source, and mainly support self-hosted. In this way, most developers can easily deploy their own note-taking service locally or on their server.

 Since one hdd usually only uses 150-200mb/s even with sequential write a 3g connection per drive should be more than enough. So my plan was to just get one 12g 16drive hba (like the lsi 9300-16i) and then use sas expanders/splitters. (Current plan to use them in four 10 disks each raidz2 pools)
 What would be a good option? Most of the ones i found are just 6gb
 Any advice on whats the best/most cost efficient way to achieve this setup when every drive should be able to utilize its full speed? 
 Thanks

 I have a question to r/DataHoarder's.
 A lot of people is downloading stuff to 'preserve' it or 'not to be lost'. Why then not use IPFS for storing them ? It seems to be perfect solution for preserving data in a way that is 'not lost' (multiple redundant copies kept by people who want to provide it).
 I know there might be some copyright restrictions that prevent sharing, but a lot of people are keeping 'free' software like Linux ISO etc.

 I am trying to plan out a build for the following function:
  
Plex/Jellyfin Server (2x 4K stream at the same time)
 Nextcloud
 Webserver
 Seedbox
 Try to minimize power requirements as much as possible. 
  
Expecting to run about 50-60 docker containers for various apps and development. 
 I already have the following parts:
  
2x 1TB SSDs M.2 NVMe for OS (RAID 1)
 4x 10TB HDD SATA 6 for Media server (RAID 10)
 4x 8TB HDD SATA 6 for Webserver/Nextcloud/Development/Database (RAID 5/1/10?)
 
Large server case with 8 drive bays
 PCPartPicker Part List
 
  
 Type Item Price 
  
 CPU Intel Core i5-12600K 3.7 GHz 10-Core Processor $249.99 @ B&H 
  CPU Cooler Vetroo V5 52 CFM CPU Cooler $34.99 @ Amazon 
  Motherboard ASRock Z690 Pro RS ATX LGA1700 Motherboard $158.99 @ Newegg 
  Memory Corsair Vengeance LPX 64 GB (2 x 32 GB) DDR4-2400 CL16 Memory $127.99 @ Newegg 
  Power Supply be quiet! Straight Power 11 550 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply $119.90 @ B&H 
  Prices include shipping, taxes, rebates, and discounts   
  Total $691.86  
 
 ​
 Questions/Concerns:
  
Please let me know your thoughts on this build?
 Should I use RAID 5 for Webserver/Nextcloud or is it better to use RAID 1 or RAID 10
 Does it need a more powerful CPU? more RAM?
 Will I need a video card for the media server?
 Do I need a motherboard with multigig ethernet port or will it be more cost effective/better to just purchase a separate card with 10gbe or SPF+?
 I also have a 1000W power supply that I can use instead of this 550W, but Im not sure if the electricity cost will be more with the 1000W vs the 550W in the table above?
  
Thank you in advance for any help you can provide!!

 Have tried PiVPN via two proxmox nodes as lxc and VM (J4125 and i5-6500t) and I'm getting about half the bandwidth that the Pi is giving me.
 I've played with MTU and that doesn't help.
 Is there a better way set WG up?
 OpenVPN is an option but most likely yield worse results so hoping WG will pull through.
 Iperf3 results are Gb each way. Have iperfed to an online server too and have got 500 down 80 up from the pi so I'm sure there is room for improvement 
 Any ideas / tips for a struggling soul?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought one of these at the $109.99 price (about $118 with tax, delivered) to add as an 8th drive on a DS1821+. After Black Friday it is now back up to $119.99:
 https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Blue-Hard-Drive/dp/B09KMGQG5Y
 All other slots are populated with a mix of helium and non-helium 8TB drives, all MyBook and EasyStore shucks. I could not find any information on the Internet regarding whether this drive would honor the disable head parking command. It does.
 The warranty was advertised as 2 years. WD warranty checker lists the warranty as 3 years.
 This WD80EAZZ arrived with idle3-tools reporting head parking at 80 (8 seconds). This drive honors the idle3-tools command to disable head parking. I ran idle3-tools via direct sata connection from an Ubuntu 20.04 server.
 To do this from Ubuntu:
 sudo apt update
 sudo apt install idle3-tools
 sudo fdisk -l (to list what disk label your WD80EAZZ is set at)
 sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 (verify that drive respond to the idle3 command, and lists the parking time as 80)
 sudo idle3ctl -d /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 (you should get a "head parking disabled" message)
 Shutoff the computer. Fully poweroff the drive. Reboot and run
 sudo idle3ctl -g /dev/sdX (replace "X" with the correct drive label)
 ...to verify that the head parking disabled setting survived poweroff.
 This drive appears to be mechanically identical to the white label non-helium EasyStore/MyBook drives. But, it does arrive with head parking set to 80.
 This drive seems like a steal at this price. I had 2 4TB Reds fail within the warranty period. Due to the failed Reds, I gave up on Reds and started buying white label 8TB drives. I have had zero white label drives fail so far. I am sure one white will fail tomorrow.

 While most systems focus on the web (which covers almost all platforms) unfortunately, for someone like me who enjoys watching Youtube on TV, I'm stuck watching obnoxious unskippable ads the from the Roku Youtube app.
 I've had enough, that's why I created Playlet: a Roku TV app that integrates Invidious and SponsorBlock, so I can have the watching experience I needed.
 Find the repo here https://github.com/iBicha/playlet - v0.5.0 just released!
 I created this app for my own use, but I thought maybe few folks here might find it useful (honestly I don't even know who would be interested outside of this sub).
 It's in a usable state, but lots of features are on the roadmap, and I'm only getting started.
 If you do end up trying it out, I would appreciate any feedback!

 Edit 2: someone told me to check how the drive sounds when it reads the disk, sounds like vrrrrrrrrrr, skrrrrrrr, krrrrrr then vrrrr again
 Edit 3: someone told me to use cloud to backup my data, i don't know how to reach that cloud whilst carrying all my disks
 Edit 4: someone said i should use DSDD, i don't like DS games, no thanks!
 Edit 5: got told that diskettes sometimes get dirty and i should try licking it, tastes like TV static, 1/10 never trying again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My guess: the answer is no (but I am still happy to hear your thoughts).
 I have somewhat around ~20 IMAP email accounts (more like ~50 when you count all the aliases) with different domains, servers and whatnot. It's always a hassle when something changes to also update my email clients on various computers, smartphones and so on. Also: I have a laptop for work on which I don't want to install a private email client. 
 The obvious answer to my "problem" is to have a webmail client which has access to all my IMAP mailboxes ... but I am not sure if I am comfortable with putting a service out there that can access all my personal data. I have basic knowledge of IT security and high respect of selfhosting critical applications on internet-connected machines. 
 As convenience is always kinda opposed to security, I guess, my question is: how big is the risk when using something like RoundCube on a VPS? Can I easily harden it to a degree that it is still comfortable to use but also secure (enough)? How can I test security and monitor dangers like automated attacks or hacking attempts? Is it a good balance between secure and convenient to not host on a public VPS but on a sever that is only reachable via VPN/wireguard/tailscale...?
 TL;DR: How would you set up a webmail client that has access to all your mailboxes in a way that makes you feel safe?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve currently got four Hik CCTV cameras, segregated on a VLAN with no internet access, and I’m utilising Frigate with Home Assistant for mobile notifications. This all works great. 
 I also have an intruder alarm, with sensors round the house/office/garage, but it’s a traditional alarm that I have to pay £100 to a company to keep it running. 
 I’m wondering if there’s a better solution where I can rip out this alarm system and install something else that doesn’t require a company to maintain it.
 For requirements I’d say:
  
Ability to arm different zones. With the current system, I can arm the downstairs, upstairs, garage and office independently or altogether. 
 Ability to arm/disarm from my phone
 Notifications when the alarm is tripped, whether I’m at home or away. 
  
Any suggestions?
 Thanks in advance!

 I just build my first home server. I have a lot of experience with Docker and web development, but I got few questions on the architecture I would use on this homelab.
 I'd primarily use it for hosting my personal website (portfolio), use it as a NAS (for video editing and general file sharing - locally and over the internet (maybe nextcloud and something else?)), torrenting, media (probably Jellyfin), deploying dev builds of websites I'm working on and intercepting DNS traffic / ad-tracker-blocking. 
 ​
 Hardware:
 CPU: Ryzen 4500; 
 RAM: 16G; 
 GPU: GTX 10603G; 
 Storage: SSD128G, HDD4TB; 
 ​
 I'd love to hear your software recommendations and tips, because so far I've got an Ubuntu Server with nothing. What software should I use for my desired use cases, what GUI would you recommend? Niche tips and tricks?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background
 I'm scheduled to move next year to another continent (11hr plane flight away) and would like to keep a backup of my data at a family members house. This is to store my personal data/linux ISOs etc and is purely for my benefit. Unfortunately, there's no one who can maintain the system in my abscence & I dont have a concrete plan on how often I will be back in my home country.
 So, the question is, how much maintenance does a 6disk array Truenas system need with new drives?
 I realise this question is subjective as everyones 'milage may vary' and no guarantee our experiences would be the same.
 My estimates are:
  
consumer nas drives last around 3 years from new
 sometimes more, sometimes less
 system would be running z2 so if a drive fails then Id shut down the system and consider my options.
 Ideally, if scrubbing has issues, SMART detects issues then I'd want to replace the 'bad' drive
  
Question1. Is it a bad idea to consider having data off-site without anyone to maintain it? Does more drives=more maintenance? 
 Qu2: i.e I could 3 larger drives in Z1 or 6smaller drives in Z2, does one option (typically) require more involvement in replacing faulty drives on average? 
 I would of course be able to access the drive via ssh/web interface to maintain the nas remotely.
 Qu3: Finally, in the case that one drive has bad sectors in truenas - is there an easy way to work out which drive has the fault? In the case I had to relay this to someone on site - how do we work out which bad drive out of the 6 is the bad one? 
 Thanks for your advice.

 I've rethought my design for my next nas (Truenas scale) and am contemplating using 6 x4TB drives via Raid-Z2. I'd like to re-use a PSU I already have (I need to go inspect it otherwise I'd share with you now) and am wondering the following questions:
  
How much PSU wattage do I need?
 I heard somewhere that molex converters to Sata power is bad. Is this true?
 Is there a 'gold standard' of how to power 6 drives using a typical consumer PSU?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 unfortunately I have a strange problem on my Proxmox box (but probably it is not related to Proxmox itself). The system keeps adding a wrong IPv6 route. When I manually remove the route or reconnect the LAN-cable everything is fine for a few minutes. After that the wrong rule appears again and I have no clue what is adding the rule over and over again.
 The wrong route leads to no IPv6 connectivity across VLANs.
 The affected interface is eno1 which is connected to a switch access port that is associated to VLAN10. eno1 gets an IPv6 address as intended (":d910:"/"cc10" is my marker for: DHCPv6 in VLAN10):
 https://preview.redd.it/4n9v24jlsj3a1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=b95c42c7fa8f76989be23ff88e835c2a6129cdf9
 And here is the wrong route that keeps popping up. The prefix ":d920" is only handed out in VLAN20. eno1 should never see this! Removing this route leads to working IPv6 connectivity, but the route keeps reappearing.

 I also checked with rdisc6 if eno1 does see any wrong router advertisments. But everything seems to be fine (only ":d910:" appears):

 I'm really desperate as I'm trying to debug this for 1-2 weeks now. I have no clue what I could check next. Any hint/advice is highly appreciated! What keeps adding the route and how can I fix the root cause?
 Thanks for reading!

 I have an old pc that runs docker and manage it through portainer. Looking at lots of YouTube video's how to savely expose my Nextcloud instance. Well, I found a very interesting option called Cloudflare Zero Trust. No need to open ports on my router and use a proxy for save connection.
 I have setup a tunnel with a subdomain nextcloud.mydomain.com with service HTTP and url 192.168.x.xx:8080. After that created an application that bypasses my home ip. Now I can access Nextcloud via http://nextcloud.mydomain.com. Till now I get it and works, but my question is...
 Is using HTTP a bad thing? Is the connection between the browser and cloudflare HTTPS and between cloudflare and my server HTTP?
 Hope someone might explain a bit more and if there are any tips how to improve the setup. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL/DR: can you look at my list of components below for a NAS/PleX server for <5 simultaneous streams with hardware encoding to be built in a 4U case with space for 100TB+ of storage and let me know if it all looks good for my use case?
 ---
 Hey everyone!
 I’m looking to build my first NAS/server and I’d love to get some build help. I’ve built computers in the past and have some technical knowledge, but nothing compared to this community. So, here’s what I’m looking to do:
  
NAS - I’m a video editor by trade, mostly 4K. I want a 100+ TB NAS to house archive files, and/or working files (if possible). I will hardwire my workstation to the NAS.
 PleX - I have a small-sized (<50) digital blu-ray collection and other digital movies in compressed formats that I’d like to house on my server and give access to close friends and family. <5 streams at once. Yes to hardware encoding.
 Experimentation - As this is my first introduction to all of this, I’d love to experiment with things like Radarr, Sonarr, home automation, Pi-hole, and I’m sure other things in the future.
  
The hardware I've picked out can be found here or outlined below:
 ​
  
 CPU Intel Core i5-11400 
  
 Motherboard Gigabyte Z590 AORUS MASTER ATX LGA 1200 
  Memory G.Skill Aegis 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4-2666 
  Power Supply Corsair RM550x (2021) 550W 80+ Gold 
  Tiered Cache Storage (2X) TEAMGROUP MP33 1TB M.2 
  OS Drive Kingston NV2 500GB M.2 
  Storage Drives Seagate IronWolf Pro 18TB 7200 RPM (or 20TB depending on prices at time of purchase)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I regularly back up my main PC drive to an internal HDD using Macrium Reflect. I just image the full drive and send that image to that HDD. 
 However, I’m paranoid about catastrophes such as fires and such, so I’ve been looking for a way to at least save one image on an offshore cloud. 
 I tried Macrium Reflect with Microsoft Azure, but my 20mb/s upload speed against a 400GB image file made uploading basically impossible. 
 I’m not sure what to do. My other alternative is to occasionally back up a single image to an external HDD, and hide that in a fireproof safe or something, but even that’s not foolproof. 
 Ideas? Ideally not expensive ideas lol.

 I just received my Prodesk (picked one used for 85e in my local area), it currently have a Celeron g4900T. (the exact model is 7HS04EC#ABF)
 Searching on the HP website, i found a pdf listing the differents cpu you can put, I7 8700T, i5 8600T, i5 8500T, i3 xxxxT, and some others GxxxxT (only 35W T).
 I'd like to upgrade to an i5 8500T, but they are pretty rare in my region and quite on the expensive side, I found that the i5 8400T is almost the same performance wise.
 My question is, will a i5 8400T work instead of my G4900T ? both are Coffee Lake S
 Also can I use a non T version of the i5, the power supply is 65W so probably not ?
 Thanks !

 I would appreciate any guidance on best practices for cold storage of content. I generate content for projects which is stored on External WD drives. One drive per project with each project consuming 4-8TB of space. Roughly 2-3 projects per quarter. Consequently, I'm starting to get overwhelmed with the number of external drives living in a closet.
 There was a great video posted recently showing a migration to LTO which caught my interest. The size, weight and longevity of the LTO cartridges is very appealing but, wow, the LTO drive is pricey!
 Is the move to LTO worth the apparent pain and initial cost?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fellow datahoarders! I need your help.
 What programs do you use to sort out photos/videos/media? I’ve been doing a multi-year project where I’m gathering all of my family photos, old and new. I follow the 3-2-1 backup plan to make sure nothing happens in the task of gathering and digitizing old photos, but now I have thousands of pieces of media that I need to comprehensively organize that will make them easy to find and view. I’ve looked online but a lot of the programs don’t seem to be what I specifically need, lacking some feature. 
 The key features I want out of the organizing software: 
  
Tagging system (e.g. being able to search for a photo/group of photos by date/person/event/place/source at the same time) 
 
A timeline view (not really needed but would definitely be awesome.)
 
Ability to mass rename media in an organized way (eg. making a group of photos ‘2021_03_08-baseball-game-pics-cannon_rebel’ 
 
Lossless conversion (might just need another program for this one) / lossless viewing after import 
 
Supports ranges of file formats (PNG, JPEG, HEIC, GIF, etc.)
 
 The program doesn’t need cloud options/storage available or built-in photo editing, but if it happens to have it then that’s an added bonus. 
 In total when I’m completely done with the project, I’m expecting probably about 200-300gb of media. 
 I’m open for both free and paid programs, just let me know a good one, thanks!
 Edit: Currently using Windows 10

 I've got some power adapters for things, like my Netgear Orbi, where they rotated the plug like 90 degrees, resulting in it covering a bunch of other outlets.
 What's a reliable/least likely to cause an electrical fire "adapter" that I can use to rotate some plugs 90 degrees to get them "out of the way"?
 Was looking at UPSes when it occurred to me I wouldn't need one of not for these stupid plugs.

I'm having some users on my network trying to access resources and when they receive the login portal, after entering their username it never transitions to allowing them to enter their password. There are no errors in the web browser itself and there are no errors reported in the logs on the server. Interestingly, if you follow the same exact procedure in a private window it works fine. Can't seem to figure out why it doesn't work in a regular browser window. I will also note that this is a issue pertaining to just firefox. But it is happening across several machines. I have tried deleting cookies and cache but both do not fix this problem. Has anyone seen similar Behavior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a 500GB SSD as my main macOS drive in my Mac Pro. Typically when I download files it goes to the SSD and then I move it to my home servers. 
 I know that SSDs have a limited amount of write cycles and that typically larger SSDs usually last longer due to more space for load wear leveling, but I don't really know how much is too much given the size of an SSD. TRIM is also enabled.
 Given the usage my SSD sees in about a week on average (see image), should I move the download location to one of the other internal hard drives and/or get a larger SSD? 
 Thanks in advance!

 My question is would the write speed of an SMR drive throttle the 1gbps connection I will be using to fill the said drive?
 I can format the drive after each dump. I heard that helps with speed for SMR drives.
 P.S.
 It has to be SMR because I need a 2.5" drive without an external power supply and a 4TB ssd is just too expensive for me

 Is there any way that I can format these backup disks in Windows such that they will play nicely in unraid, after I wipe my NAS array and rebuild in unraid, in order to move all the files from the backup to the unraid array? NTFS does not seem to be a great option.
 Edit: I realize now I should have mentioned this, but my main problem is that my backup is not a server, but a JBOD with SFF cables hanging out the back that I then plug into the soon-to-be unRAID server. Maybe I should think about migrating my backup to an actual server before performing this migration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble finding a self hosted time keeping project to use for our internal team. I've checked out the ones listed in the AwesomeSelfHosted github, but they seem geared to billing time to a customer. 
 Does anyone know of a self hosted project where its centered around just tracking hours for employee's office hours? Then, at the end of the period, the manager can go get a report that shows X employee has X hours for X pay period? 
 Thanks!

I was looking into Synology, since they have a photo setup that lets me search people by name, but I don't know that I even want to trust Synology. SyncThing looks really nice, but doesn't help me when I need to access files on my phone that are on one of my computers.
 I found NextCloud as a potential solution.
 I have no idea what it takes to get anything like this set up. I currently have about 4 TB worth of data that I need to store/access remotely. Any recommendations on hardware or just in general for getting things set up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This topic has been discussed many times, but i didn't find anything specific to my situation.
 I would like to create a RAID1 with 2 sata drives (same brand, model,capacity). My objective is to have this raid accessible from both Windows and Ubuntu, wich are located in 2 other separate drives. So i am not trying to boot from the raid, i am just using it for storing data. I know that the easy solution would be to go for a real raid controller card, but im trying to find out if it is really necessary to spend more money. As for the software raid option, for what i've understood you can't do such a thing and make it accessible from both linux and windows, but correct me if im wrong.
 So now i am thinking about doing it using the built-in motherboard controller, but every discussion i've read comes to the conclusion that you shouldn't do it because:
 1 - If you change motherboard you won't be sure your next hardware is gonna read the data.
 2 - motherboard implementations of raid usually use CPU resources.
 3 - motherboard implementations usually dont have powerloss safety features, and this could mess up the data. 
 My questions are:
 1 - Are statements (1) and (3) true also if you have a RAID1 configuration? I am saying this beacuse since it is just a straight copy i would assume the way the data is written isn't that cryptic and i can read it easily if one of the 2 corrupts(or if i change motherboard).
 2 - Do all motherboards do this "fake" raid? In my case on the manufacturer site explicitly says that it supports RAID 0, 1 and 10.
 3 - Is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to do? 
 My motherboard : https://it.msi.com/Motherboard/B450-GAMING-PRO-CARBON-MAX-WIFI/Specification

 I am a bit perplexed, and concerned if this could be a faulty product, like actually a 12TB drive with malfunctioning firmware to report itself as 16TB.
 This is my first time buying a large capacity hard drive, so I posted my question here, hoping to get some answers from more experienced people.
 edit: forgot to mention the box front sticker said 16TB while the barcode sticker said it's a 12TB model

 I want to ask between the two, which one is better to retire aka backup? I wouldn't mind keeping the faster and older one, but if it deteriorates along the way and risks to die, wouldnt it better to retire and leave it alone where it just sits there?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am new to self-hosting, but I am learning, and I am very glad that I found this sub.
 ​
 A friend of mine asked me for some advice that is beyond me, so I am bringing the situation to you fine folks. He has an account with GoDaddy that provides him 100 email addresses (and I assume the web site) for his business. He has had this for a long time, but recently GoDaddy has changed and has become way more expensive than what he is willing to pay.
 ​
 He asked me how difficult it would be to set up an email server in his home to handle the email for his business. I looked over the intro post for this sub, but as I am just getting into this sort of thing, most of the stuff on Github was beyond me. Is this something that could be self-hosted? I should say, is this something that could be self-hosted and administered easily? I have some background with IT and networking, but he doesn't have any, and I don't want to get him set up with something that is going to turn into a full-time job for me, you know?
 ​
 I appreciate any help/advice, web sites, etc.
 ​
 Edit: Thank you to everyone that responded. I definitely need to get more information from him (how many accounts currently, how much mail sent/received per month on average, what his budget looks like, etc), but I will definitely bring your thoughts to him and see what he thinks. Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I currently have a server with : 1 x 8TB HDD Ironwolf for Data, 1 x 10TB HDD Red for Backup, 1 x 500GB M.2 Crucial for Boot Drive and Linux VM, 2 x 4TB Ironwolf and Red (i still don't know what to do with them for the moment) , 1 x 250GB SSD Sata Kingstone (Old boot drive no use for the moment),
 Now i have my 8TB Backup as sync in my 10TB , 500GB + VM Backup in my 10TB, 4TB Ironwolf backup in my 4TB Red,
 I would like to know if its a good idea to create a partition on the 10TB. With the exact size as my 8TB to backup sync my 8TB in this partition like if i have exactly the same drive and create a partition with the space left to backup my Boot drive and maybe other thing.
 I will probably use the 250GB SSD to put my vm on this one. And backup this ssd with the boot drive backup (inside the 10TB)
 So the goal is to simulate a real drive and be able to see if the sync got the same size, improve the organisation between my 2 backup. Thats not a crucial feature is more a idea i've got recently. Thx for your help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 Issue:
  
My partner just got a new iPhone, and has a ton of old photos on the old iPhone
 They want to be able to somehow view the older photos on the new iPhone without moving them over
  
Research:
  
I looked into this issue, and only found 'My Photo Stream' which appears to be a shitty way for Apple to force people to basically sign up for their Apple iCloud service.
 The problem with this is that you're only able to see the photos from the last 30 days which is obviously shilling towards having to buy an iCloud storage account.
 They also appear to be kind of limiting the service as well and it appears to be discontinuing in the near future, so this isn't even a long term solution.
  
Question:
  
With this in mind, I wanted to ask if anyone knew anything I can host on my local LAN file server that could automatically show an image gallery similar to the 'Photos' app that exists on iPhone itself? 
 I figured there's gotta be a way around this, and I will even pay for a stupid iOS app that would allow for this as well (once, not subscription based though etc).
  
​
 Me as the hardcore Linux / Android user cringes with this kind of scenario however you can't change Apple fans for some reason unfortunately. As much as I hate this scenario, I figured maybe someone might help me out and this would be a good reference for someone as well.
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I manage an emby server that i share with my friends / family. On a recent trip across the globe, i noticed that emby load times were pretty slow from very far away (>5000 miles) . This was not an internet speed issue as the internet was very fast and the server is on gigabit. Direct SSH connections to my server were also significantly slower. Struggling to scp files at 5MB/sec.
 What can i do to significantly decrease remote server latency when accessing from very far away, specifically for emby?
 - I just turned on cloudflare proxy while being careful to disable caching since video streaming is technically against their terms of service. I'm not sure if this will help but i assume so due to increased peering
 - Would a kubernetes cluster help? Has anyone tried creating a CDN with kubernetes? Or would this not help since volume data is still mounted far away?
 - Other cheap CDN services that people use / recommend?

 I was wondering if one of you who have the SFF variant of the OptiPlex 9010 or 7010 could tell me if it uses one of those slim laptop style optical drives, or if it has a full 5.25 bay.
 I'm blind, so I'm unable to see pictures of the unit, and I've found conflicting discussions online. I'm trying to figure out if I could use one of these brackets to install another 3.5 drive, or if I'd be limited to installing an SSD using something like this. If it uses a slim drive, I also need to figure out if I'd need any sort of power adapter to connect an SSD.
 Thanks

 I am aware that Protecli sells some small computers that one can configure online and saw that one can choose Coreboot on that unit. Now, supposedly I buy the same exact hardware from Aliexpress, would Protectli Coreboot .img file work on my Chinese small computer? I am weary of any computer with proprietary BIOS without any updates running as main router, thus the question. Anyone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have two shucked drives that I've connected to my main PC. I wanted to enact a two-way mirror with Windows' Storage Spaces. However, as the title says, the two drives are not the same size; one is 6 TB and the other is 10 TB. What I initially thought to do is to create a two partitions on the 10 TB drive: one is the same size as the 6 TB drive and part of the storage space, and the other partition to be an extra general drive for media, game storage, etc.
 So my question is: is this a sensible setup? Should I just set up a storage space with the two drives without creating separate partitions? Is there a third option that I'm not thinking of?

 I want to do it because with OPNsense i'll able to:
 -Isolate Crypto miner from whole network(just in case)
 -Isolate IoT devices in one network and let HomeAssistant be bridge between SFW network
 -Isolate other devices in pools for easier troubleshooting 
 AP question
 Do you know AP that can broadcast network(3 networks):
 - 5GHz and 2.4GHz with same SID name
 - 2.4GHz hidden IoT network
 Its running :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently acquired a dell Poweredge R620. This is my first piece of enterprise gear, so I'm still learning a lot. I would like to add a GPU to the server for gaming. I know I can't add anything too crazy and it has to be under 75W, but after watching a video by Craft Computing talking about the Tesla P4 I thought it would be a perfect fit for this server. Also they are really cheap right now compared to what they were a few months ago. 
 Since I'm still new, and this is my first time ever doing anything like this, I wanted some advice before I purchased anything. Is it a good idea to go with the Tesla P4 or should I use something else? Is there anything in addition to the GPU that I would need to purchase? I know I might need a fan for cooling, but is there something I might be forgetting? Also does anyone have this setup? Would it even be possible? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 I want to backup my google photos and videos, and I want to do it programmatically, ideally once a day at the end of the day. Problem that I'm facing is that all instruction for programmatic access to google photos using OAuth have a WebUI step where you need to click to confirm access. It's like they are built for me as a service provider that needs access to users photos and I ask the user to enter their info so my software can interact with their library.
 Does anyone know of a process where I can auth against my google photos, get the token and then manipulate my library without any UI interactions?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wanting to get a Mikrotik switch and I am wondering how much difference 512 MB of RAM that the CRS326-24G-2S would cause problems? I have read on other posts that less than 1 GB of RAM can cause problems with slow speeds. I won't have a lot of traffic on my network. I am wanting to create some VLAN's to separate IoT devices in my network. I am familiar with Mikrotik eq, I worked for a WISP as a TierII technician that had some Mikrotik switches and radios. I am also looking at a CSS326-24G-2S+RM 24. I don't really need routing, just something more to learn. I am using pfSense as my router and I've out grown my 8 port switch. 
 I am not interested in Ubiquity equipment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using BackBlaze for my emergency cloud backup for just under 5 years. As my data grew and I added larger HDDs to the system it seemed like a very cost efficient emergency plan. The original plan (with 2TB drives) was to back them up using a "toaster" drive. I'd keep a copy at work and a copy at the house and BackBlaze was the emergency plan. The "Toaster" backup went out the window in 2018 when it began to take hours using "eSata" as the drives surpassed 10TB.
 Six months ago it dawn on me (one of those Duh? moments) that I now have 33TB of data on the Backblaze cloud from my six 20TB drives. In the event of a catastrophic failure the only way Backblaze allows restoration is by downloading or a second option of selling you a USB drive that they will fill with your data. You can return up to 5 of these per year for credit.* In short, a complete restoration would take a significant amount of time in 8TB chunks, between mailings.
 I have now purchased a Synology DS1821+, which despite what it says does support Seagate Iron Wolf 20TB drives (I currently have it configured using six with SHR-2 redundancy and 1 hot spare. I'd still like to use a cloud backup but is Glacier any better at a large restoration than BackBlaze was? I'm probably paranoid, but I've lost data in the past and well, you know...
 ​
 *Prior to May of this year it was a 250GB drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Real basic question I hope someone can answer for me to save me the buttload of time it would take to find out myself through experimentation...
 If you have a Dell server (e.g. R520) with an on-board RAID controller for the backplane, and the RAID controller does not support non-RAID configurations... 
 If you, as a workaround, were to set up each disk as a single RAID0 virtual disk individually, and pass the RAID0 VDs through to the OS, would the Filesystem on the physical disk remain mountable if later removed from the RAID controller?
 In other words: does the RAID controller do anything to the structure of the disk such that it can only be mounted by the RAID controller, or would it be identical to the same disk mounted by a SAS controller without RAID?
 I'm looking to use this workaround to mount disks to pass through to a guest OS, and want to ensure that I am not dependent on the continued operation of the host RAID controller to access and work with the data, so that if/when the host controller dies or is replaced with another device, I can just plug the drives in to another SAS controller and have them be recognized and mounted normally.
 Thanks in advance.
 P.S. if I don't get an answer here I'll need to verify it myself by several passes of formatting and mounting and OSing and swapping 10TB disks between servers so that could take a while.... I'll post the results here if I do though because I'm not a monster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all, posted on /r/Ubiquiti, but I figured y'all might have some experience on the switch side: https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/z8y6y7/uapachd_when_cold_started_with_poe_switch/
 I had a weird issue I was hoping someone could help with.
 In my house, I use a Brocade ICX6450 switch, which supports POE (802.3af and 802.3at). Indeed, I had figured out how to make this whole thing work before things broke after a power outage and I had to do my workaround again.
 I have two UAP-AC-HD APs and one UAP-AC-Pro. The Pro has no issues - I connect it to the switch, tell it to turn POE on, and it's immediately detected as 802.3af. Obviously also works fine with an injector. However, both of the HDs - when the AP has been disconnected for a while (e.g. 5 hour power outage), when it's connected to the switch, it's detected as "non-standard PD". When I connect it to an 802.3at injector, it turns on fine.
 Here's the strange thing - if I have it on the injector for a little bit of time (~5 minutes or so) then immediately plug it into the switch directly, the switch senses it as 802.3at and feeds it power.
 Has anyone run into this before? Or does this sound familiar to anyone?

 My first thought was to just export the database and setup WP from scratch and import the db. (I know my way around databases a little.) So I used mysqldump to export it but when I open the exported file, the only post is the initial/generic "My first post". None of my posts are there!?!
 OK, I thought, let's try to fix the database connection. I looked in both containers (as well as the host volume) and found the wp-config.php file - but it has absolutely nothing in it about my database. It says "define( 'DB_USER', getenv_docker('WORDPRESS_DB_USER', 'example username') );" I'm pretty sure that "WORDPRESS_DB_USER" is a variable but it's not defined in the wp-config.php file. Where does it get the values for the vars?
 I'm starting to freak out, here. I spent a lot of time on a lot of posts and now I can't seem to find them anywhere. They can't be gone, can they? Just from restarting the containers? I'm obviously very limited in what I can do, here (partly by my limited knowledge and partly) because it's running in a container with no GUI and no way (that I know of) to run phpMySql. I *do* know the MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD but I can't figure out where to use them.
 PLEASE HELP!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I currently have a server setup as my NAS, but I would like to not use the onboard SATA ports anymore.
 I already use some kind of SAS2008 card (flashed to IT mode), with the two SAS ports used up to 8 SATA Hard drives.
 I'm now looking at SAS Expanders because that seems like the right option to add storage connectivity to my server.
 At first I found the Intel RES2SV240 wich has a total of 6 SFF-8087 connectors and external power since my motherboard PCIe are full or too small.
 I also found the cheap 03X3834 IBM LSI 6GB, but I would need a mining riser to power the card. 
 Finally, I found the Adaptec AEC-82885T. It has external power connection, but I would need to change my current SFF-8087 to Sata cables for ones that uses SFF-8643. One great advantage are the external ports which will be useful in the future.
 So currently my plan is to buy that Adaptec Card to future-proof my setup.
 Is there anyone with experience with the Adaptec card (or the Intel one?). I plan to use it with a TrueNAS Scale VM on-top of Proxmox (with the HBA pass-thru).

I liked the way paperless-ng tags everything so you can easily find needed documents by the tags, but it uses OCR and text, my idea is something similar but for image even if I would have to spend some time manually tagging the pictures.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm not sure what the best backup utility would be for what I am looking for.
 My fantasy of backing up files would be placing everything in a single folder and having an automatic scheduled time each week/day for backups to be uploaded to a free and secure cloud storage service.
 The backup would be encrypted first so that if the cloud service becomes compromised my data may still have safety.
 Ideally if a crazy house fire were to occur my data being in the cloud could be restored and decrypted from a different location if my home computer were to melt. If it exists, maybe something similar to how Veracrypt handles encryption where only a password is needed to decrypt files.
 ---
 + Automatic scheduled backups (daily/weekly)
 + Cloud support for arbitrary (free) cloud services such as Mega, Proton Drive, etc.
 + Encryption of data and decryption via passphrase
 + Free or libre

 Thinking about maybe putting an 18U server rack in a storage area under the stairs?
 Wondering about how especially on exterior walls, if we add spray foam it will be hard to use old cable to pull new cable for future upgrades.
 Wondering if I should have conduit anywhere I will spray foam? This way if technology is significantly different in 20 years I can pull something else through and leave the spray foam intact? If so, are there key words I can search for to find good info about low voltage conduit?
 Wondering about larger conduit into the server rack are as well.
 I’m pretty ignorant. I mean, I’ve read a lot and think I have a plan but I have very little hands on experience. This may not be a typical question for here but I figured if anyone would know, you guys would.
 Thanks.

 For quite some time now, I've had 3-4 different hosts set up with Cloudflare Tunnels. Public hostname set to hit NPM instance, then handling all subdomains/subfolders/SSL from there. At some time last night, it all stopped working.
 I changed from wildcard to just base domain and pointed at insert dashboard here with Cloudflare and that works, but pointing a subdomain/subfolder to a different service does not. 
 I later updated a different domain name with my home IP and did the old school port forwarding 443 to NPM and that works. 
 So this tells me it's something with Argo?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to make my first homelab but I want some help to consider what I should buy.
 Reason:
  
to learn and play with technologies.
 to learn about virtualization
 I already know about kubernetes, but I have never provisioned a cluster myself. So the goal is to provision VMs and then make a kubernetes cluster on top of that.
 What will the cluster be running? I don't know exactly, maybe some bots, some self hosting, gitops testing, docker multi-arch building etc.
  
Important factors:
  
Noise
 Consumption
  
What I was thinking was to buy a Deskmini x300 with 64GB ram, 1TB SSD and a 5600g Ryzen. I think it should be enough for 4 VM k8s cluster (one master and 3 nodes) and also some space for other things.
 However, I am considering if it makes sense to buy a Ryzen 5700g instead. Going that way, it is going to be more expensive but I also fear about the two important factors above. I think I would have to buy a Noctua fan and on top of that, I am not even sure the deskmini x300 PSU can handle the CPU.
 I should also add that I want to run it mainly headless with SSH connection from my laptop. I am still not sure if I want to buy a screen, don't have much space in my office.

I had heard of DigitalFaq and that they had a lot of good information on how to do this, like what VCR's to get and what software to use, etc. I also found that they provide professional digitzing services for VHS tapes. I figured since I only had a crappy VCR/DVD combo unit, I wouldn't mind paying to have them professionally recorded to digital video files.
 I contacted them (that in itself was a bit of a hassle and took a while - this was a red flag and I really shouldn't have persued it after that). Eventually some guy named “K” (turns out this is the owner), responded and I sent him one of my VHS tapes to test out the process.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The domain registrar Namecheap offers hosting services as well.
 One of those service plans - labeled Stellar Plus (see here: https://www.namecheap.com/hosting/shared/) - allows users an "Unmetered SSD."
 From my research online, there is a limit to the inodes (I believe around 300,000) but if you theoretically compressed / split your files in a few tar archive(s) you could potentially achieve unlimited storage? Paying ~$70/month seems a bargain when it comes to that.
 If I actually considered this, I'd definitely encrypt the files before uploading (they have an FTP option, with unmetered bandwidth)
 So my question is this: did I find a bargain or am I barking up the wrong tree/have no idea what's up?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I just found this legal page on Namecheap: https://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/aup/. From it's section labeled " Additional Acceptable Use Policy for Virtual accounts", it seems like the maximum file size would be 10GB based on their text. So, I guess the limit might be 3 petabytes? 10GB * 300,000 inodes (each archive would be 10GB)

 I don't want to (cannot) install anything on external devices (e.g. at work), so a browser based interface would be great,
 I tried Firefox in Docker but it was awkwardyl slow and I have no idea how to password protect it.
 I think I'm not looking in the right direction ... any other idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently in my PC case there are 2x 6TB WD Reds (WD60EFRX), each about 5 years old, and they are quiet and fast enough for my needs. But they're getting old and running out of space. 
 Now I'd like to upgrade to something like 2x 12/14TB or similar, and when I checked some reviews for the newest WD Reds or Ultrastars, they're filled with people who complain about the clicking/PWL noises in idle. Which is this thump every 5 seconds in idle:
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksgOgrbRPOo
 That would bother me to no end, since my drives are bolt directly to the case and any vibration would be amplified. I don't mind a bit more noise when the drive is working, but not this constant Chinese torture. So are there any drives that are 12TB+ and still suitable for a PC case? All the "consumer" HDDs only go up to about 4-6TB.
 Choices would be: 
  
WD Red Plus/Pro or WD Ultrastar
 Toshiba Enterprise MG08/MG09 or Toshiba N300
 Seagate Exos X or Seagate Ironwolf
  
So any of these comparable to my old WD Reds 6TB? Obviously them being 5400rpm they are a bit quieter, but I don't think I would mind them being a bit louder when working, as long as they are quiet in idle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've recently started creating an managing websites, so now I have to setup mailboxes for my clients. I use a separate cPanel account for every clients, and use that to setup the mailboxes, and it is working fine.
 What is troubling me is that as a user I always assumed the content of my email messages was encrypted and hidden even to the system admin and didn't suspect I, as an admin, could access freely my client's mailboxes. I assumed this was why you send a link to ask them to set their own password. However, disregarding on how the password is choosen, I simply have to click "Check mail" in cPanel to access whatever I want.
 I understand this is because I'm using client's cPanel to set their mailboxes, but they would never be able to do the job by themselves, so I guess I have no other option.
 Unfortunately, when dealing with one particular client, I also assured them I cannot access their email accounts. Now I'm pretty sure this is not even legal, and it looks like a huge privacy flaw to me.
 So, how can this be normal?
 Is there a way to avoid being able to access my clients' mailboxes?
 Thank you very much!

 I want to set up paperless ngx this weekend, did a lot of research and looking forward to use it.
 BUT ... is there any way to automaticaly sort documents in folders for different adresssants?
 I know its possible to automatically sort it into {created_year}/{correspondent}/{title} ... with a few other parameters.
 Background of this is, I want to sort in documents for my father and for me to seperate folder structures like {myself}/{created_year}/{correspondent}/{title} and {my_dad}/{created_year}/{correspondent}/{title}
 Any idea if this is possible? Weather automatically or manually?
 Important for me is, that it is really a folder structure, not only tagged.

 Thinking of taking some of the 1TB SSD’s from my old server and turning them into a cache drive on my new server but I’m not sure about that yet.
 Compared to my old proxmox server (which used around 2.5KWh daily), this server uses less than 1KWh daily, so I’m happy with the investment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm building a rack since I now work from home and this is needed. I need good bandwidth while not ruining myself and we all know this can go quite fast in networking and servers.
 On another sub a user told me that if I wanted to max out the SFP+ ports between my server and my computers I needed RDMA. I then found an RDMA daughter card for my r730xd server and Mellanox CX3 cards for my computers.
 I then asked myself, is my switch compliant with RDMA? Another user replied and said that a switch needs to be PFC (Priority Flow Control) so it can do RDMA. For my budget I'm currently looking at the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP which have 4x SFP+ ports and PoE and is L2+ which does everything I need. At least that's what I though before that unclear stuff about RDMA. I called TP-Link and they told me my question was too complicated and that someone would call me back tomorrow which they did. The man on the phone was really lost and couldn't answer my question and said I would receive an email. I never received an email and it's been dead silent since then.
 TLDR; Can someone tell me if the TP-Link TL-SG3428XMP can do RDMA over 10GB/s between my server and my computers all on SFP+ ports?
 Sorry to ask for a noob question in this sub but I need help and really have to take a decision on the network daughter card before they ship my server.

 Here's where I need advice. I cannot find a access point that will also function as an Ethernet switch, so should I...
 A. Get 3 wifi routers and set two of them up as access point nodes. 
 Or
 B. Go from modem to wifi router to managed switches in the rooms that currently have the satellites and replace the satellites with Poe access points.
 Or
 C. Someone who is way smarter than me will give me direction to a better solution.

 Am toying with nextcloud have just got setup on my unraid system. But wondering if there is a better tool out there?
 I want to deliver drone video footage to clients.
 I want actionable information about who downloaded data & when.
 I think inviting clients to create an account will be too much trouble.
 Is there a way I can send them a unique link and have them effectively sign for the files by inputing their names, email & phone number & clicking agree?
 Often clients may share the link with others and this is a way of safely sharing the files but also keeping some trail.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks, looking for a sanity check as google has failed me so far. I have a mini pc (windows 10) with a QNAP TR-004 usb3 attached. Set up a windows share of that drive on my network. That PC is plugged in to my comcast router. The Comcast WiFi sucks though so I have an ASUS mesh network plugged in to that for whole house devices. The windows PC also runs Plex so I can’t put it behind a double nat by plugging it into the ASUS. I’ve got a 5ghz backhaul between the mesh network nodes and my home computer hardwired to one of the mesh nodes.
 Here’s the trouble… copying files between them I get like 30mbps. Using windows copy or Teracopy, doesn’t matter. 
 Both computers Speedtest at 500mbps to the internet ( and between the computers using a program to test LAN speed at 600+mbps) so clearly the WiFi backhaul is plenty faster to my home pc. 
 Any settings tweaks to speed up windows copies? It feels like those copies aren’t multithreaded… is there a better copy program that will?

 I thought I was safe as all of my equipment is surge protected. Last night we had a very close lightning strike. 
 The surge travelled through the ground. Into an unplugged coax cable outside. Through that cable and into an AP inside. Through that AP and into my Cat5e cables. Through those cables and killed my 24 port managed switch. It may have also damaged the NIC on one of my servers.
 This is my current theory at least.
 It is also a good idea to backup your switch configs to a remote server. Configuring my new switch is going to be a pain.

 Sorry I’m asking too after some people already did, I’d like to get a personal recommendation please.
 I’m regular to turn on my PC sometime during the day, at night shutting it down, and in between it enters sleep mode after 15 minutes of no use.
 For the last days I’m having my new HDD connected for some hours a day. I understood that an HDD doesn’t like being plugged out and in, and until now I did that because I haven’t been using it frequently. But now that I am, what is it best to do?
 Should I leave it connected to PC and continue letting it go in a sleep mode and shut it down once a day? Or is sleep mode/shutdown not good for the HDD and I should eject and unplug it?
 And what would be the recommendation if I go back to use it not as much?
 Thanks in advance.

 Someone mentioned recently they always spent 15% of the available space for a par2 data parity file when backup up to CD-R. Clearly back in the day. That idea intrigued me.
 Then someone chimed in that they still do this to this day for backups! Is this prevalent and a thing you are doing?
 I for one do a SHA512 crc of all the files and back up using 3-2-1 where ZFS 128bit, is the cornerstone of my approach. 
 However I have not done any more steps to improve the likelihood of recovery success. Maybe this is it?

 - Ability to import metadata for each file (currently in .csv files)
 - Ability to sort quickly between a handful of categories (creating my own hot keys is fine) and add free form tags
 - I would love to use the same app for photos and videos, but I've been operating under the assumption I will not find an app that will do both. 
 - Able to access files on a server
 - Accessible by multiple users on both Mac and Windows. Bonus: some ability to work on iOS or Android. 
 I'm currently using Devonthink for just images, which works *fine* but is giving me problems importing video via AppleScript and doesn't have Windows options. Anyone have any suggestions of what other options there may be out there to try to handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have a question about using Tdarr.
 I have an old Acer Aspire lying around which I turned into a Plex server. The OS is Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS. It doesn't have that much space, and I heard that you could use Tdarr to compress video files. Is there any way I can run it on my laptop? Most of what I saw online about Tdarr was using it on something like a NAS or Unraid PC using Docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently am using a Synology DS918+ purely for storage (3x 14TB WD HDDs). I have a mini ASRock PC with an i7-1100K with 2x 1TB NVME SSD's running Unraid for all of my dockers (plex) & VMs. I like Unraid for that.
 ​
 I purchased a 10gbe switch and am evaluating what to do with my setup to use at least 2.5gbe on my NAS and primary workstation.
 ​
  
Build a cheap AMD Ryzen 3 or Ryzen 5 ATX tower and put in my 14TB HDDs (3 are in my DS918+ and I have 2 extra) and 32GB of ECC RAM and run TrueNAS or Xpenology and setup shares. Keep using my little i7 unraid box for VMs & docker (plex). I'd do 3 or 4 HDDS to start in Z1. I can add another array in the future? I'm a TrueNAS noob.
 Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Unraid for everything. No ECC RAM though with the i7... Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. Only concern is will I have issues with bitrot on Unraid vs. ZFS or Synology SHR.
 Use my i7-1100K CPU in a mATX motherboard and a case with more space for drives. Run Proxmox and setup TrueNAS as a VM and run my Win & Linux VMs to proxmox. Sell my DS918+ and my ASRock Mini barebones. 
 Buy a 5-bay DS1522+ use 4x14TB HDDs, 1x14TB HDD as a hotswap. Add their overpriced 10gbe card. Keep using it as my file shares, use Hyperbackup to other offsite DS220 and cloud backup to GDrive. Keep my mini i7 Unraid box. Sell my DS918+ to recoup some of the expense of new one.
  
I do like how easy Synology makes things (love Hyperbackup). I use their quickconnect feature and OpenVPN to access it remotely. For accessing my Unraid remotely I use Tailscale. If I used TrueNAS, what do they offer for easy offsite backups and syncing to google drive?
 ​
 I have a short depth server rack so I can't use any full size servers. An ATX tower I would set on the floor. It's all in a 5x5 closet, no ventilation. So I do have to consider heat. Currently the Synology HDDs run 37-40C.
 ​
 Any feedback appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lived under a rock, and only today I found a service called Tailscale.com . I think other provider offers the same thing, one alternative seems to be zerotier.com 
 Basically I needed to expose an home server and I was ready to do the usual dance of enabling port forward on the router, expose SSH server to public internet, maybe install wireguard...etc.
 I looked into this sub for inspirations and I found tailscale, and it blew my mind. All devices are connected just "like magic"....now I'm wondering "where is the bad news?" 
 I can imagine that someone doesn't like to use private service for network routing, but if that's the only problem, I can live with that :)

 I’m looking to back up the movies/TV in my plex server (~12 TB) on my DS 920+ to a cloud provider, since I have external hard drives as local backups. I’ve only had the NAS for a few months but want to make sure I don’t lose my data and adhere to the 3-2-1 rule.
 Synology C2 is an option that I’m considering primarily because it seems like it should integrate well with the NAS, and the cost seems slightly better than what I would have to pay for something like Backblaze (~$800 vs. ~$1000).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I'm doing my first NAS build, and I'm hoping to get some eyes on my part list to check that everything makes sense before I pull the trigger. I've got the following constraints:
  
Rack mounted
 Quiet enough that I can sleep in the same room if needed
 ECC memory
 Can run a media server w/ transcoding
  
And here's my parts list:
  
 Component Choice Comments/questions 
  
 Case RSV-L4500U 15 bays for 4U isn't much, but I'm hoping it will improve cooling (read: run quieter) 
  Motherboard Supermicro X11SCH-F  
  CPU Intel Xeon E-2288G  
  RAM 32GB ECC Is this compatible with both the CPU and mobo? 
  Boot drive 32GB SuperMicro SATADOM  
  HBA LSI 9211-8i (look on eBay)  
  Hard drives WD Red I plan to start with a single mirrored pair and add mirrored pairs as needed 
  Cooling Noctua case/cpu fans  
  PSU Corsair ATX 650W 80 plus gold  
 
 For software I plan to run zfs on TrueNAS CORE. I plan to add mirrored pair vdevs over time as needed.
 Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share what we've been working on at Grist. We've been experimenting with AI-generated Python formulas to help everyday spreadsheet users write formulas in spreadsheets. Why? Spreadsheets are the original low-code platform – sprinkle in a little bit of code and you get a big benefit. But that little bit of code can be daunting for some. What if AI could bridge the gap between what the user needs a formula to do, as expressed in plain English, and the correct formula?
 While AI spreadsheet formula writing is not new, Grist has two benefits:
  
Grist supports Python formulas in the spreadsheet. Current AI models are quite good at writing Python code, and getting better. As a bonus, by writing formulas in Python, this tool could help spreadsheet users learn Python, a more universal and capable language than traditional spreadsheet functions.
 A Grist document is a relational database with its schema neatly described in Python in Grist's "Code View," which is available to the bot, helping it make inferences.
  
We tested the experiment using formulas from our template gallery to approximate real use cases. The AI-generated formulas were correct 36 out of 48 times in the minimal experiment dataset. You can view the results of that test here: https://public.getgrist.com/n3jAtRYDSVWe/AI-Formula-dataset
 And a gif to show it in action! 
 https://i.redd.it/2tlx5xfl953a1.gif
 While this feature is not yet a part of Grist for the everyday spreadsheet user, we wanted to share the experiment's code with self-hosters who might want to play with it.

 I believe it came with a MonoPrice order (with 1U keystone blank panel), and they're in bags of 24.
 The rectangular size is ALMOST exactly the dimensions of an ethernet plug (looking at an Ethernet plug from the "front", meaning the smallest dimension). But they don't seem meant for empty sockets as they just fall out..
 I normally label everything I keep precisely to avoid this problem, lol. TYVM.

 EDIT: Added 2nd image to show how it doesn't seem to relate to the 1U keystone plate. These little pieces are 1cm or 5/16 wide.

 I have a whole bunch of HDDs for different backups and every few months, connect them to this caddy and use a comparison tool to drag new / updated files across.
 It's more of a case that I don't continually backup and rarely need to access the backed up data, so electricity costs probably won't be worth keeping a NAS on all the time (although I could combine it with a HTPC, but even that we use less than once a week these days).
 So... people who backup, do you have backups attached through as NAS or what?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been shopping around for various Unified Device Management solutions that would allow the workers at my small company to sign in to their devices with SSO (OpenID Connect or SAML) or LDAP. Additionally, I would like to be able to manage the policies on these devices.
 Ideally, we'd like something self-hosted, but I have not found anything that comes even close to meeting these criteria.
 The closest options we've found:
 - Mesh Central - If we used this solution, then it seems like we'd only be able to use *remote* machines. Such as self-hosted remote workspaces. Not sure if it allows for policy management in addition to access management.
 - VMware Workspace One - Offers exactly what we need, including LDAP sync, but is not self-hosted and requires a 25-user or 25-device minimum, which is much more than we need at the moment.
 -PGina - It is free, open source, and self-hosted but not actively maintained and only offers Windows Authentication and no policy controls.
 We've also considered spinning up a Microsoft Active Directory instance, establishing a trust between it and our FreeIPA instance, and having Windows computers access it over VPN, but that only solves the problem for Windows computers.
 Are any of you familiar with any self-hosted applications which allow for Unified Device Management similar to what we are looking for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am pointing a subdomain to DuckDNS which is pointing to my home server which is hosting my website on Nginx.
 The DNS is set up as follows:
 site.mydomain.com ---CNAME---> site.duckdns.org ---> Server Dynamic IP
 Port forwarding is set up on my router which routes 80 to 80, 443 to 443, and 2200 to 22 (Port 22 is used by my router itself) of the home server's internal IP.
 I have managed to get it working but the weird part is that this setup only works when I'm connecting from outside the network. When I'm in the network, everything (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH) doesn't work at all. What could be possibly the issue here? Pinging from the terminal, however, seems to be working fine.
 I have also tried those 3 services using both the domain site.mydomain.com and site.duckdns.org but both aren't working. It however works if I'm using the Internal IP 192.168.0.XXX. Public IP doesn't work too unless I'm not connected to the same network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I am new to NAS and all this stuff haha, so I could really use some tips and useful information in the proccess.
 ​
 Background information
 ​
 I have 3 main external hard drives:
 ​
 1. 14 TB for Movies 2. 14 TB for TV Shows 3. 2 TB for Family Photos, Backup of my smartphone photos and other important stuff 4. I will buy hard drives for each one of these external hard drives because I want to have everything with a backup. 
 ​
 Movies: 80% is 1080p, 20% is 2160p (90% of them x265)
 TV Shows: 90% is 1080p, 10% is 2160p (all of them x265)
 ​
 I download the media content through Arrs (Sonarr, Radarr and Bazarr) and play it through Plex in all my devices.
 ​
 I would like to have the 3 hard drives always running in the NAS and make the backups for them 4 times a year (with external HDD and keep them in a different location for robberies or fires).
 ​
 Any useful information about the way I would like to manage my NAS and data would be nice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 So I'm looking into options to take a group of roughly 40 people off Facebook. Right now we use a mixture of FB groups and email to communicate, and multiple Google calendars to organise us. Cost is pretty crucial, as in I don't really have money to spend. I can spare up to $15 on a VPS or root server but that's about it. I'm an absolute novice when it comes to self hosting but I can find my way around a console if there's a good tutorial. 
 So far I had rocket.chat running in a VM and I like a lot. It does everything I want more or less out of the box. The thing I'm worried about is the notification limit on the free tier, 10 000 notifications / user / month comes down to 8.33 / user / day with a group of 40. Not a lot. Then again I'm unsure how much the DM function will be used so maybe it's fine? Compiling and distributing my own mobile apps is a bit much. Or is it? 
 I've seen matrix with element recommended a lot but I don't quite get what the difference between the free and commercial element tiers are? Should I host my own element instance? What about mobile apps if I self host?
 Bonus question, jitsi looks great and is easy to integrate. Do I need to host my own server? I can't quite figure out what the limitations of meet.jit.si are?
 Apologies for the wall of text. This is all new to me and I'm quite surprised and exciting by the options out there!

 Finally people on the call are just like,… “did your power go out like 3 times? And how are you still… why didn’t you… what the?”
 Of course all my APs are PoE back to the Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE in the basement, and everything including the Fios ONT is battery backed up by UPS.
 This was the first live test but it worked flawlessly 😎
 Anyone else have success stories that made you pat yourself on the back and think “man I’m glad I did this right.”?

Through my Oblivion and Sims mods are gone as they were only on the destroyed drive, I got most of my audiobooks, ebooks and comics back, as well as personal pictures and data. I feel so relieved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a doctoral student, and while I've been storing copies of my research files (camera trap photos, R code files, some GIS files, etc) on an external drive, I've been thinking about adding a cloud storage service for redundancy. My research files at the moment total just under 100 GB (my system in total takes up under 350 GB, in case a full system backup is what is recommended). I don't expect to access these files often (ideally never) but in case something happens on my machine, or I just do something stupid and delete a file/folder I need, I want to be able to quickly access/retrieve the needed files/folders (so not necessarily retrieving the whole system). It would be nice to encrypt my research files, but I'm not working on anything where I am unduly worried about data theft in any case. I'd say my priorities are: 
  
Reliability 
 Cost (of storage primarily, then upload/download)
 Download Speed/accessibility 
 Security/Privacy 
 Upload speed
  
I use a Windows machine from Lenovo if that makes any difference, but could conceivably move to a Macbook down the line. I use File History with my external backup drive.
 I'm posting cus I see so many different recommendations from iDrive to Backblaze to IceDrive to Mega, etc, including in this subreddit, and I figure at this point I'm overthinking it and should seek recs for my specific use case scenario (or maybe for what I want, it doesn't really matter all that much what I choose)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having an issue getting pleroma to work properly. I've been trying to host a pleroma instance on debian 11 bullsyeye. Installed pleroma and nginx using this guide: https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/installation/debian_based_en/. When I access pleroma using localhost:4000, I can see my instance, but it is not connected to the outside world (The search bar doesn't return anything). In the pleroma server terminal I get this warning: 
 [warn] Rate limiter disabled due to forwarded IP not being found. Please ensure your reverse proxy is providing the X-Fowarded-For header or disable the remote IP plug/rate limiter.
 When I try and access pleroma using my domain, I just get infinate loading. Meanwhile the pleroma server shows GET requests. Almost like pleroma is receiving the requests but the information is not getting out to the user. 
 My Pleroma.nginx config is enterly stock apart from changing the server name and certificate locations.
 I have portfowarding configered on my router, and when I access my domain name without pleroma running, I get a defult Nginx is working, but you need to configure it. Which implies my domain name does point towards my debain machine. So im completely stuck. Installed and reinstalled pleroma and nginx and even the OS a few times. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated, I am new to linux and networking.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear reddit,
 My name is Rodolfo Berrios and I'm an indie developer from Chile.
 I created an image sharing software called Chevereto (username checks out) which I introduced in 2007. Chevereto enables to create your own image sharing website. Pretty much like your own Imgur/Flickr/etc. It is made to replace the need for these services and cheaply run it on your servers. The idea came when ImageShack removed pictures that I was hot-linking at online forums and here we are after all these years.
 Chevereto is a family company, I'm in charge of the software and my wife does marketing. We are a small team and we love what we do.
 I'm posting here to introduce our new free edition, AGPLv3 licensed, now available at chevereto/chevereto. This edition is focused in personal usage and it is on pair with our paid releases.
 Hope you can give it a try and thanks for reading!
 P.S. You can learn more about this new Chevereto free edition in a post I wrote at my blog.

 On some sites like Mubi, there are very interesting films which can be hard to come across in other places. I have discovered many rare films this way and when they remove them from the catalog they are very hard to find. I work in film stuff and would love to be able to revisit many of these later on.
 Can anyone point me to how I could do this? Any sites, videos, posts, etc, which explain this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you

 I'm not exactly a major datahoarder but I'm definitely a sentimentalist. Recently thanks to some dumb decisions on my part and not paying attention while working on hard drives, and some circumstances that led to me losing my backups, I lost 2TB of super important sentimental data spanning 18 years almost. I feel like an idiot for screwing this up so badly. It's been three weeks and I'm horribly depressed to say the least. I feel like I lost a loved one.
 Those who can share experiences and give advice, please do, I want to stop feeling so much intense grief. Or at least reduce it.
 (Before anyone brings it up, no, data recovery is impossible)

 I read through some threads here and it seems very hit or miss either way (sending bare shucked drive or reassembling). I'm guessing there's no way for us to tell which internal drive belongs in which shell?

 I want a storage solution for family photos and videos kept on over 20 separate CDs and 2-3 USB drives.
 I found this HDD in a local store and was wondering whether it could be used for storage (connected to a docking station) from time to time.
 I read that this is a surveillance HDD that can be used 24/7, so my question is if it can be used occasionally, say once every two months, and then stored somewhere else without power?

 However, there's a small discrepancy in the total files/file sizes.
 Is there a tool to analyze both drives and show me which files it finds that differ between the two?
 Everything seems to be (mostly) in order, but there's a 6GB difference in used space on the two drives.
 (Also worth noting that my taskbar flashes for a few seconds while the desktop loads on the cloned drive, which doesn't happen if I boot from the old drive. I am using an app called TaskbarX, but it isn't working properly since cloning and I don't think that's the issue as the flashing was happening prior to re-configuring that program. In any case, this isn't the proper subreddit for that particular issue)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realize this questions gets thrown around a lot, but here I am asking again as I wasn't happy with the specifics per the other posts I came across. Perhaps a sticky/reference list of all the more common SFP+ modules, their release date, compatability with things like ESXi, general performance expecations, costs, ect.
 In my particular case, I've got a new R450 that I'll be using with Hyper-V on a slightly older T440 Hyper-V host. I'd like to setup replication between them and the backups we are creating could also use some wider bandwidth than 1gb NICs (no LAG, avoiding it). The new R450 came with a Broadcom dual SFP+. I'd be using 1 SFP+ via a DAC back to our UniFi Pro switch and I was thinking of creating a direct connection between the two hosts with SFP+ and a DAC cable. Making this purely for replication of our multiple VMs and virtual workstations, preventing this traffic from even having to touch our switches.
 The Intel x520-DA2 all seem long in the tooth and picky about modules, and the newer x710 even more so. Is there another solid option for dual SFP+ modules that play nice with Dell Servers (T440)?

 Some (or all) PoE ports

Is there a solution like Unraid, but free? I'd like to just add my drives together and go. I typically used Raidz1, Unraid has a solution so does synology, I assume a freee option exists too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I recently picked up a Dell R720 on trademe (New Zealand website). It's got:
 2x E5-2630v2, 128GB DDR3, 8x 3.5", Perc H310 Mini, and an idrac express.
 So, overkill for home use, but hey, why not right!?
 ​
 So first I'm going ot make sure I'm all up do date with the firmware and things. Anything else I should do before getting started (like upgrading to a certain level of firmware and not all the way?)
 ​
 After that is done, on to installing more hardware. So far I've got 2x 8TB Ironwolfs and 6x 2TB Dell Enterprise drives to go in the front. Was thinking I'd make one raidz2 of the 6x 2TB drives for the data storage and home backups (and use something like backblaze or google archive for offsite backup of this) and then for the two 8TB, just leave as two disks for media use for plex (don't mind if i lose media, can always redownload (1GB connection FTW!)).
 ​
 As for the OS and LXCs and VMs, since all the front bay drives will be full, I'm thinking I'll order in 2x Samsung 980 250GB and 2x PCIe nvme adapter cards. Hopefully I can use the clover bootloader method to boot off of a internal USB stick that points to the mirrored nvme cards(?)
 ​
 From there I'm thinking I'll use proxmox as my base OS and have a bunch of LXC and VMs. Currently looking to hadware pass the drives to TrueNAS and have that be the main arbiter of disk space. Any ideas if this is a good way to go? 
 ​
 I'll also be installing your usual home media things: Plex, Sonarr, Jackett, Deluge, etc.
 ​
 Along with some things like pihole, are there any other great bits of kit I should be looking at installing? Will look at getting a server nVidia GFX card for transcoding/mining/stable diffusion etc. Any ones I should look for/stay away from?

Fiber Mall and Ipolex did not work at all, it didn't even light up the in the spf+ port when I connected my cable from my patch panel to the RJ45 transceiver. The Hi Fiber did light up but it was stuck at 1Gb, not 10Gb. For NICs in my gaming rig I have a TP Link TX401 and I tried the X520-T2 both resulted in just 1Gb.

 I have a small plex media server I use for porn primarily and movies secondary. I really like the idea of being self-hosted and I like the experience of having reliable access to my media on my terms. I'm thinking of moving over all my stuff to a Jellyfin server (including music and personal photos) once I can get that working. I like how Jellyfin is open source because it makes me feel as though I can use it indefinitely as long as I have access to the source code, and I can configure it as I please.
 The only media application I don't think I can fully replace is Spotify/Apple Music soley because I like being recommended new music. Is there a way to bypass having to manually download music so that I can get new music recommendations that just magically appear on my media server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I've been hosting a few http services both in my Pi at home, and in a public cloud and I don't like the VPN way of accessing my services. Sometimes I need to browse my server in a friends computer or phone, and it gets messy or impractical, so I end up exposing the services to the public web sometimes. I worry quite a bit about forgetting to update my software and finding my server being used to host sketchy bank scams.
 What I have been thinking of doing is blacklisting every IP in my nginx reverse proxy, but allowing a single HTTP endpoint to be accessed, like "allow.domain.com", where after receiving any http request, it would add the origin IP into the whitelist for a set amount of time (a few hours). I would also setup geoblock to only allow the endpoint to be accessed from my country.
 The point is that I don't need a super locked-down set up, I just want the peace of mind that my server is not just visible to anyone. If I am at work I can authorize my ip for a few hours just by accessing a simple endpoint, if I want to share a file with a friend I can forward them a link without having to worry about setting up a VPN connection for them, just letting them know they first have to go to allow.domain.com before trying to open my link every few hours or days. 
 Is that ok? I searched a bit to see if there's something like this prod. ready but I couldn't find. I know it's still the single point of failure of the http service being open to the web, and the fact that it's a bit "security through obscurity", but I just need something to give a little reassurance and more security than just being blindly open to the world. I am not hosting copyrighted media, or anything illegal, just a few status servers, change detection, python-notebook, a few api's I made for my work, non-private files, etc.

 I have a PowerEdge M630 that I'm trying to install and boot XCP-NG from iSCSI on. It looks like XCP-NG doesn't support software iSCSI boot, and I have to use an iSCSI HBA. My M630 has a QLogic converged NIC with BCM57810 which according to this document has "Offloaded full HBA functionality iSCSI initiator". To me that means I should be able to mount a target and have it visible to the OS for install. (Maybe I'm wrong here?) I have configured the card in BIOS, and sometimes I can see the card connect to the target, sometimes it doesn't. Anytime it tries it says the connection succeeded though. Does this chipset need drivers installed for it to be visible to XCP-NG? Or should it just work? Furthermore, am I misunderstanding something / going about this incorrectly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies in advance if I missed a section in the hardware FAQs -
 I am designing a small home lab on a rack-mount server that supports 10-20 VM workloads (TrueNAS, pfSense, Plex, handful of others, plus some headroom to mess around). I need minimum 8 3.5" HDD bays for my NAS, though 12 would be ideal. As for the other equipment, I plan to use an unmanaged network switch and a UPS with a maximum depth of about 16 inches.
 When I look around for rack-mount PC cases or chassis, most of them are at least 27 inches deep, which would extend the overall footprint of the rack by quite a bit. I am aiming for low power consumption and don't need a ton of VMs, so I am considering a microATX motherboard or similar small footprint. I see a handful of shallow-depth chassis or cases out there but none of them seem have enough HDD bays.
 My question is: Are there any shallow depth rack cases/chassis out there with at least 8 HDD bays? I don't mind going with a 4U or even taller system if it allows me to arrange the drives vertically above the mobo. My main goal is to reduce the floor footprint. Thanks!

 I understand that if a drive fails you can just swap it out and the NAS will repair/repopulate data from the other drive, but I don't know what would happen if the NAS itself failed? Do you just connect the drives to PC and copy/paste the files inside, or do you have to get another NAS of the same brand and hook the drives up to the new NAS to access those files?
 I'm planning on getting a 2 bay Synology and set up RAID 1.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I'm having a hard time finding a quality 6+ port USB hub to hook temporarily (4-5 months) six MyBooks (all 14TB) to a mini-PC on a Type-C USB 3.1 Gen 2 port. Typical usage would be copy/move stuff between the internal SSD drive to any one of the six MyBooks (one operation at a time). The important thing is the presence of individual on/off switches, so the drives would only run on demand (I need each one only 2-3 times a week and don't want them spinning up randomly or at boot/shutdown).
 The only semi-legit device I can find is this hub by StarTech, however, most people in the sub have a pretty bad opinion about that brand and the price seems a bit steep, to be honest. That being said, the last thing I want is for my data to become corrupted because of some alphabet soup brand's bad hardware... (speaking of which, any recommendations for a solid USB-B to Type-C data cable are much appreciated!)
 What I like about StarTech's device is the use of actual switches, and not buttons, which usually don't remember the last state after power-cycling...
 Thanks for reading and have a good one!

 My guess would be using old laptops? Most of the use would be for TV shows and music for most people, but I also run a business that requires streaming video meetings. I suppose a Starlink would be required, and as it is finally covering most of Australia it has to be an option, esp as 5G is nowhere near ready for proper use yet.
 Any other suggestions or directions towards websites where someone has already tried this?

 I just received 4 ironwolf 4TB drives (ST4000VN006) and started checking them for potential damage from shipping.So i did a smart check on all of them (https://file.io/0e2x4hA6sV8m)
 smartctl /dev/sdX -x 
 and discovered that one of them (Disk 2) is having "Pending Defects log (GP Log 0x0c)" unlike the 3 others.
 Is that something i should be worried about ? Should i send it back for replacement ?I can't seem to find what those infos means.
 I also started a badblocks and a long smart test on all 4 drives, but it's gonna take time.
 badblocks -v /dev/sdX smartctl /dev/sdX -t long 
 Thank you in advance.

 I've finished ripping the Blu-Rays for Avatar: The Last Airbender. And while I'm very happy with the result, each episode clocks in at around 5.5GB which isn't exactly ideal for streaming.
 I will of course be keeping these original files, but I've recently built a new PC with a 5700x and a 6700xt so I can once again re-encode things (hooray).
 The BD of ATLA is an upscaled version of the original 480p broadcasts (might've been 480i, unsure). I'm looking for "visually lossless", which should be easy as many scenes already look not the best. I'd have to apply lots sharpening filters and such to get a better look, something which I don't have experience with.
 Anyhow, using ffmpeg, how do you guys usually re-encode media for smaller sizes? Doom9 mentions a few x265 options specifically, but ofc many clients don't support direct h265 streams.
 Bonus question: blu ray subs are not fun, what's the best way to turn them into actual subtitles?

Is it possible to burn a few gigs to an M-disk, and then come back later, do a file compare and add more files to the same disk? Keeping everything that's already on the disk just adding more data.

My question: Isn't #1 diagram flawed? I started off learning the #1 diagram, but it has made it much more difficult to learn how web applications actually work with the #2 diagram.

 Does anyone have any tips to reduce the noise overall? I assume there is nothing I can do about the transformer screeching, but maybe I can replace the built-in fans with quieter Noctua ones?
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

 I can stop the forwarding any time and delete the generated email
 I'm afraid they close or stop their free service, it there any similar selfhosted container?

 I've combed through the community posts. Many seem to recommend Macrium Reflect. The posts are a bit on the older side, though. Is Macrium still a good option? 
 Also, not strictly necessary; but is there an option that allows me to keep using my system as it does the backup? I don't think even Macrium allows that on Linux systems.
 I'd really appreciate any guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Of all the media I host, it seems like RPG Rulebooks are the odd one out in that nothing works great for them. Big PDF files that need to be organized by Game, and subfolders for different resources per game (Maps, Adventures, Rule Books, Player Guides, etc).
 This 'hierarchical' structure becomes a real issue when trying to use any current solution out there for PDFs, because they really need to be grouped together, but nothing provides a folder level grouping. 
  
Paperless - No folder grouping at all. No way to subdivide rpgs into various groups without a ton of manual tagging, which should just be read at the folder level
 
Komga - Doesn't read folder hierarchy. It reads the individual folders, but it doesn't nest folders in the UI
 
Kavita - Doesn't display folder based hierarchy, and instead shows each individual PDF
 
 Are there any good PDF organization tools that can use nested folders and possibly even tags properly to organize RPG Rulebooks?

 I am still currently playing around with Etherpad, but it doesn’t allow embedding PDFs, and lacks any serious way to organize different pads. Plus I can’t find much of a community. 
 AppFlowy looks promising but is lacking most of what I currently need. 
 Affine has started over so it currently lacks everything I need, but I’m keeping an eye on it. 
 I have found a few projects that run in browser, but most don’t allow importing PDFs which is big for me. And none seem to have any “in app” organization.

Not sure how much storage Ill be putting into that, but considering I dont need to backup everything from the main storage (i dont really care that much about losing movies/tv series) itll probably be a bit smaller

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At this moment I have a high available k3s cluster running on proxmox containing ZFS storage with several applications like Authentik, jellyfin, firefly, sonarr, radarr, nextcloud, and much more. I have some applications running on a docker host as well. Every application that doesn't use sqlite has it's own database statefullset with a PVC using longhorn or NFS. The docker apps have a docker container with docker volume. Since I now have different approaches, I would like to migrate this so all applications use 1 external high-available database.
 I don't have much experience with HA databases, so I can't really decide which way I should go. I found a postgres-operator to be run on a kubernetes cluster: https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator. And a guide to setup postgres HA with patroni: https://arctype.com/blog/postgres-patroni/
 Which approach do you use at home? Any other recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am managing my self-hosted applications via Docker Compose. As the number of applications is growing, I am thinking about a backup strategy for my data stored in the Docker volumes.
 I still haven't decided whether it is better to use named Docker volumes, or just simple local volume mounts. For local volume mounts, backup would be fairly easy to do (just tar everything a move to a backup storage). For named Docker volumes, it seems like the process is a bit more complicated, since Docker doesn't seem to provide any built-in commands for backup and restore.
 How do you backup your Docker stuff? Does anyone know of applications making those things a bit easier?

However, I am looking for a simple dashboard application which gives me some statistics about my containers like CPU & memory usage etc. I am using Portainer for this single purpose right now. But since I am not managing my containers via Portainer, it seems like the wrong tools for the job. Can someone recommend something similar what gives me some stats about the containers I am running?

It seems that hard drives of that size and at capacities over 1tb are a rarity/mostly exist as external hard drives. I'd ideally like a warranty on the drives as well as opposed to shucking the drives. So far I've just been able to find a Toshiba 4tb drive for 84 dollars. However I have my doubts about it's reliability. I was hoping and wondering if someone would know of a better option than what I've found.. thanks a lot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, I have what I think is a proprietary connector, but I'd like to make sure before I shell out the big bucks on something that is commonly sold under a name I don't know.
 My company just acquired a bunch of busses, all of which included 24/7 Security's "Zeus" DVR, the problem is none of them had hard drives in them, go figure. 24/7 sells their hard drives for a cool $400 per, and I'm about to need probably 30+, that's a ton of money for hard drives. 
 Here's the info I have:
  
They're a single connector which is 20 pins.
 They are a hybrid style drive with an SSD and HDD inside- the SSD records while the bus is in motion and then transfers it to the HDD once the bus has stopped.
 There's multiple other SD card slots and the like as seen here.
  
Is there any sort of alternative to their "infinity drive" or am I stuck buying those and-or replacing the whole system? Any and all help is much appreciated.

We're talking my parents family photos as well going back the 1950s, a few CDs of my grandparents as kids/teens around the 1940s (someone digitized them when CD rom drives were relevant, crap do I need to buy a CD drive?).
 So I am a dumb ass, completely misjudged the numbers. Napkin math, which wasn't even really done, put me around 2-3k photos. Well I've barely made a dent in the first of 3 file boxes and its over 2500+. I'm estimating possible 50,000 photos at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there. I have had 2 different lab setups I did in the past at home. However I have never really done anything involving switches... it was always tinkering with and connecting up DD-WRT flashed routers and really old computers I had acquired when I was doing computer repair. We have an issue at the small office of 7 employees that I was hoping I could receive some help on. This may not be appropriate to ask here, but /r/networking seemed like it was more of a place for enterprise level stuff, and this subreddit seems to be a place for home networking. My problem falls kinda in between. 
 At my new job we have a bit of a mess in terms of a "network"... Lots of ethernet cables ran all over the building to offices that aren't used anymore. We have 2 people using USB Wifi Dongles to connect wireless to the router and the rest of the computers are hardwired between two switches. We also have an old server that is not being utilized. Folks that are hardwired to the switches can't Samba share to anyone not hooked up to the same switch. 
 I have a network cable tester and tracer coming in the mail Thursday. I figure that is probably step 1 in trying to find out what is going on since nothing is labeled anywhere. What I'm hoping to achieve is to do minimal wire runs and configuration to allow for all of us in the office to be able to communicate via Samba and set up a way for automatic backups to be done on the old server that is not in use.
 It seems to me that connecting the switches together through a simple configuration might would solve these problems. A very basic overview of networking basics seems like where I need to start. I'm hoping to not have to dive too deep and eat up too much time. If anyone has a good link or resource for me, it would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've had a home server up and running for a few months, at first it was just local with only plex exposed. Now I am going to visit family in December and I want to access my media server while I'm away, and I've got that working. I've done the following for my server and i want to know if I need to do anything else, security-wise.
 - I have NOT exposed the unRAID web UI to the internet.
 - All exposed containers are running on a customer bridge network.
 - Nginx reverse Proxy manager manages which ports are exposed to subdomains.
 - Nginx has an SSL certificate and all containers are forced to use HTTPS.
 - In Cloudflare, I've set the domain to full SSL/TLS encryption.
 - All containers have different passwords to access.
 The only thing I can think of doing next is adding a VPN, but I'd like to know from you guys how important you think it is to implement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm building a website for a political party and we need something similar to Google Forms but with the ability to ask the user to confirm his entry by clicking a link sent in his emails. Compatibility with Zapier is a really nice bonus, but at least ease of integration for third party APIs or webhooks is required (we'll need it to link the forms to compagnies' API in order to send mail IRL when an entry is confirmed, and we're also working with Ghost's member panel).
 I spoted Budibase, which looks quite cool and way simpler / cheaper than Backendless for what we'll do with it. (two or three forms) But I can't find any documentation mentionning the ability to require the user to click on a confirmation link. Is it doable ?
 ​
 Thanks

 YMMV. This is definitely a hacky solution.

Enable IOMMU

 Find the line GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT and add amd_iommu=on or intel_iommu=on for AMD or Intel CPUs respectively

 I’m new in this self-hosting game, I’ve been watching this sub and looking into self hosting myself for quite some time but haven’t been able to for money reasons.
 I want to self host for multiple reasons. First reason, chalenge, i don’t have much infra/system/server/network experience, i have a beginning diploma but I don’t have the school smarts to continue. Second reason, fun, I like tech, always have and I love having these kind of projects. Third, privacy, in my tech journey I’ve discovered how messed up compagnies handle your data and i don’t like it. Fourth and important one for this post, I kind of want to put this in my resume somehow, might even be a part of my resume, or even could be the full resume if I can somehow.
 So, my actual question is : since i want my self hosting on my resume, and i know that in entreprise level hosting, they mostly use Kubernetes and not docker (wich i am currently using but can change that, I’m not toi far yet) should I and can I use Kubernetes on my main and only server as a server with no Kubernetes clients attached to it, I might and probably will attach more servers to it in the future but for now is it actually doable and is it worth it ? I could also make multiple VMs in my main server and cluster those together but i know that doesn’t go too well with the Kubernetes philosophy so not too sure what to think about that. Anyway, I’m waiting on all of your opinions to see what i can/should do, thanks !

 After research and many calls with my lovely German wife (who helped translate) we were able to get the Sh$$ box into bridge mode.
 I Currently am running OPNsense on a Fujitsu thin client and love the functionality and security it provides for my homelab.
 My problem is that the internet just sh$$s the bed sometimes, and I'm uncertain whether it's me or Vodafone. Sometime ill have a stable version I get working and then all of a sudden, internet just stops working or drops out.
 We called them, and they says there is nothing they can do and intend to improve my network where I am, but give no time frame. I also get no help configuring some setting that I need from the ISP for my OPNsense and need to find German forums of people who have figured out what setting work for them.
 Now, as tech-savvy as I am, I'm also learning with the whole dualstack configuration. Should I just give up and get this Fritzbox? Will this solve my issues, or is this just a German infrastructure thing that won't fix itself?
 I'm just searching for some advice from people who run home labs and such in Germany, specifically ex unity media customers.

 Buy an SFP+ PCIe card to go in my server, and connect via DAC cable to the router
 or
 Buy an SFP+ RJ45 1/2.5/5/10 Gbps module, plug it to my server via a regular properly rated ethernet cable. I wouldn't upgrade to a 10 gig nic in this case (not immediately).
 On one side I like the idea of having the DAC connection but have no idea if I actually currently need the bandwidth between the server and my proxmox cluster (4 machines). On the other hand I like the fact that, if I want, I can plug the RJ45 cable to any client that doesn't have the SFP+ module as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've been running old HDDs for a while now on a Chembro chassis (SAS2-compatible) that can take 24x regular 3.5" disks. Since it came later, I never bothered with moving my system onto the Chembro, so the chassis is only being used for disks, and a different chassis hosts the system, which is connected to the disks via an external SAS cable. 
 Things have been working alright, but now I want to expand. I've been eying a Supermicro SC847 chassis with capacity for 36 disks. I'll likely replace the 24-disk chassis with this one. I could also look into moving the system onto this same chassis, but I'm concerned about heat. If I were to keep the disks separate, is a chassis like the 847 the best solution? Are there any "disk only" chassis out there that would allow me to connect my system to this array? What are people using these days?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I’m working on building my unraid NAS using a few recycled parts from previous builds. I was getting things ready when I noticed several bent pins in the old mobo I had slated for the build. I have a 10700k and an 11600k for the cause. I know neither is ideal in terms of power draw/heat, but I’d prefer not to sell and replace. With all that in mind, are there any ATX boards with 2.5g LAN that make more sense than others in terms of features and price? Currently, I only need 6 sata ports and a single m.2 gen 3. Any guidance is appreciated! Thanks!
 Edit: based on my own research it looks like the Gigabyte B560 Aorus Pro AX board might do the trick. Eager for your input though!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi i hope this question is ok to ask here.
 On my homeserver i'm running an Ubuntu 18.04 VM on which i'm running a slightly old C# console application that i wrote myself. It is made in .NET Framework 4.7.2 so it needs an application called Mono to run. In case anyone doesn't know, Mono is a conversion layer to run .NET Framework applications on Linux.
 Now on the same VM i'm trying to run another console application i wrote, but this one is written in .NET 6. This version of .NET does not need mono anymore, so my exe should be able to run natively (as long as i have the .NET 6 packages installed which i do). However Mono has hijacked my './' command so now when i try to run the .NET 6 exe i get a mono error.
 What i want to achieve is to be able to run the .NET 6 normally, and explicitly use the 'mono' command when i want to run older .NET framework exe's. I don't want it to run mono when i use the './' command. How can i achieve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 I updated my computer to Fedora 37 and installed FreeFileSync v11.28 from FlatHub. 
 I've been using FFS for many years for backing up my files to a NAS Share.
 I do not keep the share permanently mounted in Fedora, I only mount it when I want to do a backup. I'd like to keep this practice. 
 In the past, I would first mount the share in Nautilus file manager, then open FFS and it would appear as a destination. Now, even if I have mounted the share in Nautilus, the share does not appear in FFS at all. 
 The NAS has the IP address 10.10.10.6 and the share is called "backup", so I assume I could enter any of the following and one would work: 
 /run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=10.10.10.6,share=backup 
 or 
 //10.10.10.6/backup 
 or 
 smb://10.10.10.6/backup 
 but none of these works. 
 Has something changed?
 Is there a way to manually add the share's full path to FFS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplexmq/releases/tag/v4.0.0
 The new server version is a major update with the support for basic client authentication - previously all servers were public, now you can deploy your private servers (or change the configuration of the ones that are already deployed), so that only you and your friends can use them to receive the messages, and any other contacts will only be able to send the messages, as the invitation links you share with them in SimpleX Chat do not include server password.
 The latest version v4.3-beta of SimpleX Chat apps also includes server testing and sharing/adding servers via QR code, but the server authentication.
 We have also prepared a detailed guide about self-hosting the SimpleX messaging servers.
 SimpleX Platform
 SimpleX is the first and afaik the only communication platform that has no user profile identifiers of any kind - not even random numbers, unlike Signal, Matrix, Session, Briar, Jami, Cwtch, etc.
 Instead of user identifiers it uses temporary pairwise connection identifiers and anonymous credentials, allowing the servers to asynchronously deliver messages without having knowledge about how many users are there and how they are connected on the protocol level (some transport-level and timing correlation is possible, of course, and there will be further improvements to mitigate it).
 The security of SimpleX platform was recently assessed by Trail of Bits - see the announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been backing up my PC games from places like Steam, GOG, etc. on 100 GB Blu-ray discs. However, I have a lot of games to back up, and modern games can very easily go over 100 GB per game. I've been throwing around the idea of giving up optical media for my backups, and going with something like a 4TB SSD, especially today on Cyber Monday; putting games onto an SSD would be a lot faster than burning them to a Blu-ray disc, and obviously any SSD that I choose is going to hold more than a single Blu-ray disc, even a triple-layer one. If all I'm using the SSD for is long-term storage, can I expect reliability? I don't even plan on putting it into my PC, I would only plug it in externally whenever I want to add something to it for safekeeping, or if I want to restore/recover something later.
 Or, if I'm looking to save some money, how are mechanical HDDs for the long-term? I assume they're not as good as something with no moving parts.
 Thanks in advance for any insight, I really love the idea of long-term archiving, but I admit that I'm pretty new at this.

 Chassis: SuperMicro SC826E16 2u with 12lff bays + 2sff rear bays Motherboard: X9SRH-7F CPU: Xeon E5-1650 v2 cpu PSU: 1xAC 1x48vdc OS: TrueNAS Scale Storage: 2x1TB sff mirror boot 2x3TB lff mirror 10x5TB lff Raid Z1 40TB useable 58TB raw
 Chassis: SuperMicro CSE-847 4u 36 lff bay Motherboard: Tyan S5512 pulled from a HYVE-CYGNUS-J CPU: Xeon E3-1230 V2 PSU: 1xAC 1x48vdc OS: TrueNAS Scale Storage: whole mess of sata and sas drives
 Mellanox SX6036 36 port infiniband switch in Ethernet mode PSU: 2xAC 
 Brocade ICX7250-48 with the PSU chopped out so it runs off 12vdc directly
 8 Odroid HC2 arm sbc sata drive sleds Running Ubuntu 20.04 as gluster bricks 3x14TB 2x12TB 3x8TB For 90TB total Which all run off 12vdc
 All 12 vdc is fed from an AC power supply and a 48 to 12 vdc converter.
 So why all the DC? I also have a diy solar array and self built 48VDC lithium ion battery packs that directly feed this equipment, no need for an inverter.
 Glad to answer any questions. This post is to motivate me towards cleaning up and better documentation habits.

 I played with Parsec and was really impressed with the smoothness of the remote feed. Curious if folks selfhost their own relay server and use Parsec for a similar use case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy all! I use Unifi as my network infrastructure, and through some libraries I've come up with a nice little web page that allows access to a QR Code for my guest wifi. 
 Is anyone aware of an e-ink-based system (similar to rasbperry pi) that I might be able to hack together to always show the guest wifi code? I'd like to randomize it and change it often, but that's difficult in practice without being able to display it readily.
 My initial thought was to try to figure out something with the e-ink price tags at best buy, but they're designed to update by NFC, so I'd need to tap the device to my phone which defeats the purpose.
 Anyway, interested in thoughts...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/w1qo9p/what_is_the_best_self_hosted_uptime_monitor_to/ I'm browsing the internet for a good uptime monitoring tool. We've used Kuma in the past, but it's unable to handle more than 300 urls. We're currently using our self made tool, which checks realtime http status and SSL validity (and a few client specific monitoring). 
 What we'd like to have:
 - Capacity voor atleast around 1000 urls
 - Uptime monitoring (history isn't needed, as long as we know a recent (5~10 minute difference, uptime status)
 - Current status page (sites that are down have to be visible in one view)
 - SSL expiry check (list those who will expire within the next 21 days)
 - optional: Notifications in teams (this is something we currently don't have but would really like)
 - optional: Notifications via mail
 We've tried zabbix, kuma, upptime and one self developed sollution, but none seem to fully qualify. I've been scrolling github for about an hour, and figured it might be time to ask for some help, so here I am.. 
 I would love to hear some of your suggestions!

After a lot of research and trial/error I’ve finally got the LDAP Outpost up and running and responding the ldapsearch queries from the terminal. I’m stuck now trying to figure out if there’s a way to configure the LDAP outpost to respond to anonymous queries, for example Mealie doesn’t have configuration options for a bind user.
 As far as I understand in a general LDAP implementation this shouldn’t be a problem as LDAP queries can either be submitted anonymously or as an unauthenticated user. What I can’t figure out is whether or not Authentik supports this and if it does how it should be configured in the outpost. I’ve been through all the Authentik documentation and every community guide I could find for integrating with other services that use LDAP but I’ve had no luck so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two routers; my ISP provided router, which handles my IoT and families devices on subnet 192.168.0.0, and my OPNSense router sitting behind my IPS router, which handles my server and personal devices on subnet 192.168.1.0.
 When my laptop is connected to the internet, it connects to my home server something like this:Laptop => https://nextcloud.foo.bar (123.45.67.89) => ISP router => OPNSense router => home server
 This configuration does not work when I am connected to my OPNSense router because my ISP router believes the connection is a loopback (Or at least, that's what I can infer). For this reason I am not able to connect to my home server without adding a line to my host file for every subdomain on my home server, which is a pain.
 TL;DR I would like to configure OPNSense to forward all connections which are directed towards my public IP, say either https://nextcloud.foo.bar or 123.45.67.89, towards my server's local IP instead, say 192.168.1.2. Basically, I'm trying to MitM myself. DNS entries will not work because my devices use a secure DNS.
 I was hoping to discover a setting similar to port triggers, except for IPs instead of ports.

 Recently set up my own personal Pleroma instance as I wanted to run my own single user instance. I was able to install Pleroma on the VPS and it runs without errors. When trying to move & follow others on other servers, it can show their profile but not their posts and when trying to follow, the follow functionality doesn't work.
 I also tried to find my own profile on my new Pleroma instance but other instances can't seem to find my instance at all saying it doesn't exist. I also tried to register my instance on instances.social as a test and it errors out saying that there's no Mastodon or Pleroma instance found on my hostname.
 Federation seems to be enabled but I'm not sure if it's actually working. I initially thought that running through Cloudflare was an issue but I disabled the proxy and that didn't fix the issue...
 I'm a Pleroma/Mastodon admin newbie and I'm not sure if I'm missing anything here. Anything assistance is much appreciated.

Like most people studying, I got fucked by the pandemic and became part of the Zoom Academy, and most of the materials we used are digital only. I wanted to know if there's a way to download 3 years' worth of documents, assignments, and such on Google Classroom to my computer. My access to these documents is coming close, so I wanted to store them for future use. Is there anything I can do, or should I download everything manually?

 ​
 I need to download a specific file type from my dropbox account. In this case only all .mp4-files. Any suggestion how I can do it? 
 ​
 It's not possible to use the "Multi file organize/Custom filters" to move all the files to a new directory. All directories needs to be kept as they are.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I built a web-ui for OpenAI's Whisper. The features available in this web-ui are:
  
Record and transcribe audio right from your browser. 
 Upload any media file (video, audio) in any format and transcribe it. 
 Option to cut audio to X seconds before transcription. 
 Option to disable file uploads. 
 
 Select input audio language 
 Translate input audio transcription to english (any language to english). 
 Download .srt subtitle file generated from audio. 
 Choose the Whisper model you want to use (tiny, base, small...) 
 Supports many languages (and more can be added, just open an issue)
 Lightweight and beautiful UI. 
 Self-hosted. No 3rd parties. 
 Docker compose for easy self-hosting 
 Privacy respecting: - All happens locally. No third parties involved. 
 Audio files are deleted immediately after processing. 
 
 Backend written in Go 
 Frontend written with Svelte and Tailwind CSS. 
 Uses C++ whisper version from whisper.cpp. 
 You don't need a GPU, uses CPU. 
 No need for complex installations.
 
  
You can find the repo with more details here: https://codeberg.org/pluja/web-whisper
 Screenshots are available here: https://codeberg.org/pluja/web-whisper#screenshots
 Edit: added a Github issue tracker: https://github.com/pluja/web-whisper

 Features I'm looking for
  
Add one-off tasks
 Set up recurring tasks
 Have reminders or some kind of "jobs to do today" mobile page or similar
 Two users so my other half can help
 Can run via Docker as easily as possible i.e. there are pre-built images on a registry and all I gotta do is run them, have found a few but I have to compile my own images or clone a github and faff and fiddle - and that's a level of skill & concentration I can't manage :(
  
I have add and I humungously struggle with starting and completing tasks but I have worked in IT for decades and when I had a helpdesk ticket I could always GTD. So hoping something similar can help my private life.
 It doesn't have to be a specific task management / to-do software, it could be a FOSS Service Desk / Ticket System which also has a Task management module, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey homelab, I've recently needed some additional storage and thought it was time to hack together a NAS to last me a few years until I have the budget for something nicer. Digging into my spare parts box, I managed to find four 1 TB HDDs (two internal drives and two old externals that are not in use) as well as a Raspberry Pi 4 (8 GB). 
 I was thinking of somehow connecting these together and have the Pi control them. Three of the drives would host media/documents and the fourth would work as a backup of just the most critical files. Should I set these in some sort of RAID array? 
 In terms of hardware, I've seen some four-bay HDD enclosures/docks such as these: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G2WRB97
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L7PSWV9
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OUSU8MI
 Would this be sufficient for my needs and do I need to purchase anything else? Alternatively I have an old tower with a water-damaged motherboard that I could chuck everything into if that's a better option.
 My other questions were with regards to the OS. I'm really only looking to set up Jellyfin and Vaultwarden via Docker. Is it worth considering a NAS distro such as OMV or TrueNAS? Or should I just go with Raspbian and create a SMB share? It's only me using this and I don't plan to configure anything fancy so I'm leaning towards the latter...
 Appreciate any feedback and advice, thanks in advance!

 I just (finally) decided to build my homelab and my question is about how safe it is to plug everything in the bedroom have allocated for this.
 The room has a total of 4 wall sockets.
 My hardware:
  
3 HP Z800 with 2 x 6c/12t, 96Gb, 3 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 HP Z820 with 2 x 8c/16t, 256Gb, 4 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 DELL T7600 with 2 x 8c/16t, 256Gb, 4 HDD, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 1 NAS (DIY) with 4c/8t i7, 32GB, 4 HDD, 1 SSD, 1 NVME and 1 x540-t2 card
 my workstation with 8c/16t, 64Gb, 2 x 1080ti, 1 SSD and 1 x540-t2 card
 2 x 8 ports 10G-base-t switches
  
This lab with be used a my personal cloud with Openstack, Proxmox, Ceph, OpnSense, Truenas. All this for Kubernetes mostly.
 Is that too much load for 2 sockets? As the other 2 are on the other side of the room or I should spread on the 4 of them? I’m just worried about fire risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to run a honeypot on my home network and visualize the logs it collects for a personal project. I understand the risks, so before I open anything up to the internet, I want to come up with a plan that will maximize security given the situation. Here's my plan so far:
  
Honeypot is on its own piece of hardware (RPi, NUC, not sure yet)
 Honeypot is in a DMZ (router has an option for this, but from what I've gathered, it'd basically just be a single-firewall DMZ)
 Vulnerable apps/services/etc. would each run in their own Docker container, which would have AppArmor profiles configured for them based on their capabilities
 Instead of running on the honeypot host directly, all Docker containers containing vulnerable things would run in an LXC container (or possibly a VM, not sure which would be better)
 VM/LXC container would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the Docker containers; host device would have an IDS to detect if anything escaped the VM/LXC container
  
What do you think of my plan so far? I'm a complete novice, so please let me know what can be improved and what you'd do differently or add.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently acquired a second-hand Synology DS218 and am trying to find out how best to use it. I see a lot of people on here mentioning that they do indeed have some kind of Synology DS, but never mention any of the apps provided by Synology.
 For the following intention, do you even boot DSM (and what do you do next to, e.g., install and then run photoprism/lychee/librephoto or nextcloud or jellyfin)?
 What I'd like to set up, is 1. a file server to share with my family and maybe a few friends, 2. a photo server where my family members can all upload their images and then share specific albums or pictures with specific outside people, restricting unintended people from access, 3. syncing our contact lists, so I don't need to register contacts my wife has already added, 4. aggregating all the digital music from my family members, 5. shared task management and "project" organizing, 6. co-journaling 7. a postgresql db (that should be higher up there...) 8.9.10.11. etc.
 I am looking into port forwarding to make all of this accessible from the outside, but I've already found out this isn't trivial at all. I'll get there, I'm confident.
 Where do I start? Install software like nextcloud and docker through DSM and continue from there or do you circumvent DSM completely and ... ? Well, what, actually? or do you use any of the Synology software, and if yes, what are your experiences?
 I am not a programmer, but know how to RTFM and I am pretty patient and happy to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm Tom and I am a DataHoarder :)
 I'm based in Europe and I've just setup a small cloud storage service.
 A short story about my initial thoughts on this project:
 I've been Hoarding Data for over two decades now, going through all phases (losing data, having multiple copies of them, 3-2-1 rules etc), and I've noticed that it is getting very expensive after a while (well, you can notice that very fast nowadays hah).
 All these started when I wanted to grab a couple of extra TBs of online storage to backup some secondary data. There aren't many affordable (mind you, $5-$7/TB might be cheap for some) options out there and all I wanted was to share a box with someone.
 So I've decided to make a little project to "fix" this. Maybe there are more people out there who think the same (you never know until you try?). I've had my ups and downs but this is something I was really excited to code. This is also the first project I created after a long time (so please be kind :)). Hopefully it will make me get back to the game.
 I'm basically splitting up the servers, no overselling or anything like that, and you can use (S)FTP, SCP, rsync, Rclone, Duplicati, BorgBackup to create your backups.
 Requesting Feedback:
 I'm offering 100GB Trials for a week for you to play around and provide any kind of feedback so I can improve either the quality of the service or the website itself. I know it requires a signup and email verification but I tried to make it as painless as possible :(
 You can check it out here.
 I'm already working on the next phase (the first one wasn't anything special, just a basic build :)) which I think it can do wonders to decrease the cost of online storage even further. Hopefully it will be ready sometime in Q1 2023. I will let you know :)
 Thank you for your time! 
 Tom
 PS: I've got approval from the moderators to post this thread.
 PS2: I've made a similar post on Hacker News earlier today, just a small FYI.

 Problem 1: Getting video from the PS5 in their game room to the TV in the livingroom. Pretty easily solved with Monoprice HDMI over IP encoder/decoders. Luckily I ran ethernet everywhere when we remodeled a few years ago. I can add additional decoders to other rooms.
 Problem 2: PlayStation consoles use Bluetooth for controller connectivity. Since these devices were designed to be used in the same room, the range isn’t all that great. This required pulling the case apart to install a pair of external antennas.
 NOTE: You do need hardwired Ethernet at any location where you are installing an encoder/decoder.
 All parts below. Maybe $130 total.

But I'm getting tired - been at this for almost 30 years - and am ready to hang up the hat, let the horse loose, and settle on the rocker....in other words, ready to stop tearing down and rebuilding the lab every few months with a new hypervisor. So, I'm kind of curious what you all use at home, and what you use to manage it. So far, been through:
 - ESX (Welcome to a new version! You know all that hardware you carefully curated to work with me? as of this release I now support none of it! Enjoy the upgrade!)
 - Hyper-V Server (You can create virtual machines after you domain join me. Oh...you have no domain? Ok, I can still work, once you set up constrained delegation....and the default client config doesn't work without modifications...and I no longer support the out-of-box cypher suites without several config settings...you sure you don't have a domain?)
 - ProxMox (Wanna buy a license? Wanna buy a license? How about a license? Hey, sexy mama...wanna buy a ProxMox license?)
 - OpenStack (Have you got 14 extra server chassis lying around? Good. Let's begin)
 - and KVM (Welcome to the command line! The default setup does almost but not quite what you, personally want. Enjoy these twenty copy/pasted blog posts and have fun with these command line tools with 400 different settings!)
 That was all fun for awhile, but I'm wanting to use my home lab and not just rebuild it endlessly (and yes, I wanted to rebuild it endlessly....that was part of the fun). So, I'm curious, all of you...what do you use day to day, and how much does the rest of what everyone else's choice suck? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Back in February I picked up an OWC Mercury Elite Pro external enclosure for pretty cheap, as it was open-box. It's a dual drive enclosure with USB 3 and eSATA connections, fairly well built with an aluminum body and fan in the back, and - importantly - has a hardware RAID controller so it can run your 2 disks individually, in Span mode, or in RAID 0 or 1.
 Thanks to Black Friday, I nabbed 2 10TB WD Red Plus drives for a good price, and my intent is to stick them in the OWC, run them in RAID 1 for mirroring, and then connecting the enclosure to a Thin Client PC over USB 3, and then installing Debian to the Thin Client to run everything I need - Plex, backups, maybe some minor game server hosting and file serving.
 The OWC's RAID seems fully featured, if one of the mirrored drives dies, all you need to do is insert a new identical drive and it will automatically rebuild (I would obviously still back up the remaining good drive before initiating the rebuild), I'm just wondering if it sounds like a good idea. On one hand, USB 3 is a very fast standard, but on the other, it feels weird to be running a 10TB mirrored NAS over a single USB cable. Maybe it's a common setup, and I'm just new to this, but I was looking for some reassurance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background: So I want to upgrade my SuperMicro board. I would need to get a Intel board (quick sync for plex) and preferably a new 13th gen CPU (delay the need to upgrade). Now I am not opposed to getting a 10G LAN card if that saves me money but I would like to maintain 2x 10GB ports like I have now. I will need to get an HBA card that will give me enough SATA for 15 drives, but there are many posts on this subreddit on which to get, so no issues there. This server will need to handle 8 transcodes simultaneously and at times 4-5 of those will be 4k video's.
 Help: Should I stay with a server board to maintain ECC or is DDR5's sudo ECC enough?
 Help: Are there any boards under $600 with 13th gen support and ECC support?
 Help: Are there even any server boards that support 13th gen?
 Notes: If I am making any wrong assumptions or am crazy with what I am looking for please help me and point in the right direction.

 is the following backup scenario kinda “overkill” for personal usage?
  
Data is stored on a RAID10 (4 disks)
 Every day a backup gets created of the RAID10 - Backup gets stored on a RAID1 - same location
 Another backup gets created which has a different location. (RAID1)
  
Do you think the RAID1 setup is necessary or just “overkill”? 
 Note: - RAID10 data pool size is 8TB (4x4TB) - RAID1 setup is also 8TB (2x 8TB) - Hardware price is ~1500€, too expensive? (Seagate IronWolf Pro)

 After a friend recently moved away, and inheriting her homelab I was able to obtain:
 25u Startech server rack
 Mikrotik CRS-317
 Mikrotik CSS-426
 Rack mounted application hosting server
 Rack mounted 36TB hosted storage
 Rack mounted Gaming PC
 Don't have all the specs written down, but it's a really good start for me.
 Things I'm looking to host:
 Proxmox
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 Heimdall
 Pterodactyl.io(game server host & manager)
 ???
 ------------------
 Any thoughts before I get too deep into trying to set things up?
 Currently using Cloudflare as a proxy for my public IP, and routing for subdomains.
 Will probably have a firewall/router at the front of the network, to route traffic to a public facing network hosting a website, game servers, and other services I plan to offer through a main site on my domain. Separately, my private network with gaming PCs for my roommate and I, and a shared gaming pc on the network rack.
 Part of my network is ready for 10gig, and with AT&T, I can upgrade my 1gig to 5gig at minimal cost.
 Viable to offer online services for game server hosting? I will eventually move to colocation or obtain redundant internet/solar for the rack and connections.

I am planning on using my old desktop case and PSU.
 Budget is preferably under $1k for the whole thing if needing a new case, etc.
 Currently, researching on my own, it seems like possible choices for a motherboard would be either a Asrock b450 (although I don't know what version/model) or a ASRock X470D4U AMD AM4 X470. Not sure what brand/type of memory and CPU I should be using or if there is other motherboard I should consider? Thanks in advance.

 My plan for the hardware is to turn it into a nas / plex / minecraft server and probably run a discord bot or two.
 But I have a few questions:
 - How big should by boot drive be? would a 32 gb nvme optane drive do?
 - How do I access this server? it'll be at my parents place since I don't want the noise in my living room
 - What os should I run?
 - should I have 16 or 32 gb of ram?
 For the NAS I plan on running 2 8 tb hdd's in raid 1 since that's what my budget allows for, specifically two Seagate Exos 7E8. and then probably a decently sized ssd for the minecraft server so like 500 gb or something. The cpu will be an intel i5 8400 and networking will just be gigabit as both my parents and I have gigabit fiber networking.
 Thank you for your help in advance I hope to post a pic of the final product

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm cloning windows to a USB drive but of course now I'm realizing I probably cannot boot from a USB drive without some specific clean Windows install to the USB drive. And I'm not sure its possible to make another usable clone from a USB drive to SATA drive if the original windows drive was to fail.
 I would expect a USB to SATA connector could potentially fix the problem, but I also don't know (rookie) if I would have to use the USB to SATA connector as I was making the clone, or if I can attach a SATA convertor after making a clone only with the use of a USB connection.
 Im using Macrium Reflect Free.
 If keeping backups of windows isnt considered data-hoarding, my bad.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm preparing for a DevOps interview and need to know AD & PowerShell APIs. My apologies if I can't ask here.
 Don't have much to work with, just a Fios G3100 router and Windows Server 2016 running on an Unraid box. My understanding is that Windows Server needs to also run DHCP server to also be a Domain Controller. Won't this conflict with my Fios router or it all depends on where I set up the DHCP server on the Fios router that would be the primary choice when devices connect to the network?
 ​
  
If i had to make the Windows Server the primary router, what would happen if the Windows Server goes offline?
 Or would I be better off making the Fios router range 2-200 and then set the range on WInServer to 202-240? and then manually setting the default Gateway (on the devices that'll be connecting to the domain) to the WinServer? 
 Is the right strategy to just put the Windows Server on its own subnet, like what do y'all do? I used to have a Unifi setup but short on space at the moment so I'm familiar with this, but is there any way to have a failover DHCP server?

 Currently, all that stuff is handled in Evernote, but if possible, I'd like to leave behind the world of proprietary systems for that task.
 Any advice?

 ​
 I have a NextCloud instance on my old laptop (the AIO version, in Docker) with an external URL. I set up port forwarding and a static IP for it. I've now set up a Jellyfin instance (also docker, this time with docker-compose) on the same device, and I want to be able to access it, but only within the network. The problem is that I can't get to it from other devices on the network. I tried 196.168... and 196.168...:8096 or 8920. 
 On Firefox, I get "Secure Connection Failed" for all versions. It keeps redirecting to https, though. I don't know if http would work, but I tried from the Jellyfin android app as well and all its "candidates" (including http) failed. I assume that it's because of some conflict with the NextCloud instance, but I don't really know how to even debug that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article on ServeTheHome got me thinking... in a RAID array where periodic "scrubs" or consistency checks are recommended to prevent bit rot, the entire disk has to be read. 
 I did some quick math for my own array which uses HGST He10 10TB drives with 550TB/yr rated workload and the default MegaRAID settings of weekly consistency check AND patrol read, resulting in
 10TB * 2 * 52 = 1040TB/yr read
 While doing both of them monthly instead is
 10TB * 2 * 12 = 240TB/yr read, leaving 310TB/yr for actually using the drives
 I searched to see if anyone else had posted here or on other forums about this concern and couldn't find anything. Should I reduce the frequency to monthly to avoid 'wearing out' the drives, or is a weekly check needed to prevent bit rot on high capacity drives?
 EDIT: thanks for all the data points confirming monthly check is okay! I was going by some old threads like this one which scared me into thinking I needed to keep the weekly default. I've switched mine to monthly now.

Logged in to see what was happening and a filesystem was missing, a disc too. Check documentation to see what disc had failed and what was in it and saw it was no valuable data and though I could just buy a new HDD and copy over the backup. Went to check other applications on the same machine and realized docker was running but not the containers. The disc where I mount all my docker volumes and keep the docker compose files is gone too. Backup discs also gone. Ups logs show no power failure. 4hddw decided to die on me the same day.
 Let's hope I can find a nice deal tomorrow on HDD or I'll be taking a break from hosting my stuff at home. 
 Check you backups and smart status. And backup at least your config elsewhere.

 I have been trying to set up Synapse Matrix server and have been having an issue with its Integration Manager. I was wondering if someone with similar setup could help me here.
 My setup is, Synapse in Docker, using element web in docker and windows Element client in Traefik instance.
 The point is to have a private server, non federated but using Element's integration manager. But for these tests I tried to run in federated anyway but it still did not work.
 We can connect to Synapse just fine, chat with each other, send files etc. Location also works, only Integration manager fails to connect. Using Federation tester at: https://federationtester.matrix.org passes all green, no errors. Using Dimension's widget shows there is a problem: https://prnt.sc/YWtVFDlrw0Th

 Posting about MyNixOS here for the first time. This is a tool I've been working on to help build and share Nix and NixOS configurations. Nix is a powerful tool to deploy software in a reproducible way, and with NixOS you can control your whole operating system through a declarative configuration.
 Starting out with Nix was exciting, but it definitely had a challenging learning curve. This made me start building a website focused on making it easier to create and share Nix flakes, which are the core unit of software deployment in Nix.
 Using the website, you can create flakes without knowing the Nix configuration language, as the necessary Nix files are generated for you. I hope this can be useful for those interested in trying out Nix for self-hosting. I'm currently us…]]></summary>

I'd like to get a scanner than can scan a small stack of papers at a time, on both sides, and deposit them vita FTP/NFS/SMB/SMTP to a directory to be consumed by paperless. I've heard there is also some detection feature for accidently scanning two pages stuck together, I probably want that as well. I have no need to run this printer independently of a PC but I don't mind if it does. Has anyone been through this and have a scanner that they like? I'm happy to spend whatever budget to buy it for life and hit that price to performance sweet spot. Better than replacing is down the line when it has problems..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is more a docker question than a selfhosting one but I hope that maybe someone knows this specific docker container so here we are...
 I'm using the docker hub image for Kanboard: https://hub.docker.com/r/kanboard/kanboard
 The issue I'm having is that the data and plugins volume files/folders do get assigned odd user and group permissions on the host. I understand why but I can't find a way to change them.
 Specifics:
  
From inside the container the nginx:nginx user/group have userid (UID) 100 and groupid (GID) 101.
 On the host UID 100 is assigned to user _apt, GID 101 is assigned to group systemd-journal. 
 So this user/group combination is being set for all files / folders from the volumes.
  
Things I've tried:
  
It doesn't make a difference if I mount them as volumes or bind the folder.
 There doesn't seem to be a way to pass UID and GID in the docker compose file as environment variables.
 Setting user in the compose file through user: "${UID}:${GID}" does change UID/GID of the container root user, not nginx.
  
Does anyone have an idea how to correct the file permissions on the host without building my own docker image?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope everyone took advantage of Black Friday to fill your storage arrays. For those that bought external drives to shuck, I have a request. I’m trying to help a couple friends get started in data hoarding and self hosting. Since I have a good stock of old spinners and the mini-PC’s that I am using don’t have internal SATA slots, I was hoping to buy some external enclosures for cheap to keep their costs down. I’d recommend that you keep a couple enclosures for Warranty returns but if you have extras let me know. Thanks for your time. If this post violates any rules, I am extremely sorry and will delete it immediately.
 Edit: I was asked to include my location since I am asking if people are willing to ship items. I am located in Florida USA. Thanks for checking out the post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just thought I would share my experience if it helps others in Australia with a similar experience.
 I shucked a Seagate 5TB Hard Drive I purchased from Amazon Australia on July 2022. It was in my Unraid server and now refuses to power up at all, completely dead. 
 I tried to use the return process on the Amazon site, but it doesn't work since its outside of the 30 day return window. Since the drive itself has a 2 year warranty, I contacted chat. They gave me a standard auto reply of "You need to go back to the manufacturer for the warranty" which is not how it works in Australia (in Australian consumer law, the retailer cannot refer you to the manufacturer or importer for warranty repairs). I replied with this information, and the chat officer offered to have someone higher up call me on my phone.
 I received the phone call, and the phone support was perfectly fine. I told them I needed to return a drive for warranty, but it was outside of the 30 days, but still has a 2 year warranty, and that I am in Australia, and purchased from Amazon Australia and needed to use them for the warranty. He accepted it straight away, and sent me a brand new 5TB Seagate Drive (he asked if I wanted a refund or replacement, but since I use it I went with replacement).
 All done and dusted, completely swapped under warranty! Not sure how it works in other countries, but in Australia the manufacturer has the burden of proof to show that shucking the drive caused the failure before they can reject a warranty, and retailer are required to work with the consumer to facilitate the warranty process (they cannot refer to manufacturer).
 If you are in Australia and need to refer to the specific detail around manufacturers warranties, just send them this: https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/problem-with-a-product-or-service-you-bought/repair-replace-refund-cancel

 Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought a QNAP TS-453D for $400, but reading more, it sounds like I can do a DIY build for comparable cost that will be much more powerful. Looking in eBay, I see a lot of used desktops (i.e. HPs, Dells, that have i3s), but space seems to be the main issue. Are there some popular consumer desktops I should look for that can easily be upgraded for 4 SATA drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, I've been labbing for a while now and have just ignored the dreaded untrusted site message as I haven't had a need. Well I decided to rebuild the labs software stack from the ground up, new DC, new OPNsense install, new everything really. As part of this I finally bit the bullet and bought a domain instead of using no-ip. 
 So after buying the domain, wasting half a day realizing that Google Domains does not use Google Cloud DNS, converting my nameservers to Cloudflare, building a webserver, and configuring certbot I now have a wildcard cert for my domain. Yay!
 I manually imported the key into OPNsense, and hooray, the secure connection lock is there, I did it! Now what? I have all the *arr's to configure, my Windows domain environment, a bunch of ESXi hosts and vCenter, etc. Is there a way that I'm missing to manage and automate the updating of certs across all these services? Across any of the services? Is it really that once a certificate is issued its your job to apply it to any service you want to use it? 
 I feel like I'm missing the whole management after issuing part... help me out here folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, Windows Explorer shows me I still have 1.95TB free out of a 3.62TB storage pool, but it freaks out when I try to copy anything to it saying no room. As you can see, this is what Windows Explorer shows for remaning and total space:
 https://preview.redd.it/y7h93qvxvd2a1.png?width=246&format=png&auto=webp&s=5009163b505e220d19239d579144ca106beeeb4b
 So I thought I'd check my storage space, which reports this:

 What's going on here? CrystalDisk Info says the drive is in good health, so why have I suddenly lost space and what's the warning of reduced resiliancy all about?
 I'm pretty new to this stuff, so I'm quite confused here - any help is appreciated.In the meantime, I'm moving what I can over to another drive that has free space. 
 EDIT: Wait no, that last disk doesn't show up in CrystalDisk Info, but the others are.
 I'd try unplugging and replugging it in, but not sure it seems worth the risk here.

AllHDD has it listed at $489 but with the wrong warranty & poor English in the listing. When I called to confirm it was the right HDD yesterday they left me on hold for 15 min while they "called the warehouse" so I hung up.
 AAAWAVE accepts both PayPal & Amazon Pay, so those of you with PayPal Credit &/or an Amazon credit card can have 6 - 12 months with no interest to pay off the purchase. 
 I own the 18 TB DC HC550 & have had a great experience with it, so I feel confident about the DC HC570. Yes, there are less expensive HDDs out there, but for those of us who have less space than funds & are fairly demanding of our HDDs this is a great way to get massive storage in a small footprint.
 1 The only other 22+ TB non-SMR HDD on the market is the Western Digital Gold which I have not been able to find for less than its 599.99 USD MSRP anywhere. It appears WD uses the same tech in both, with the exception that the Ultrastar has an SE (Secure Erase) functionality.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, 
 I'm trying to cobble together a half functional system using hardware I've obtained for free from businesses and recycling centers, and I'm looking for some advice on how to hook up an odd assortment of hdds to my bizarre server setup and create a half decent NAS.
 So far I have an HP z2 mini g3 (i7 6700, 32GB ram, 256GB SSD) I was given by a friends workplace who didn't need it, and a massive bunch of drives I got from a recycling center (don't worry I tested and scrubbed them all).
 At the moment I'm messing with Ubuntu server on the z2 to learn, but planning to switch over to Truenas Scale and create a nice little ZFS Pool when I start storing data. This is really my only server head option atm as don't have the Budget for a new system
 My main issue is: how tf do I hook up all my drives? I have: 4x 4TB 3x 3TB 2x 2TB ~14x (lol) 1TB
 All 3.5in SATA HDDs
 The z2 has a bunch of 10gbit usb ports but not much else. So far I've looked at using an external USB jbod enclosure such as the sabrent 10 bay one, but am totally open to ideas for how to connect server grade hardware to this thing.
 How would you do it? 
 Happy to experiment and put up with a reasonable amount of jank, or to try more complex solutions too!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I've been thinking of "upgrading" to a proper server for some time for my home services. I currently run everything out of an old laptop (4th i7 from 2014 w/ 16GB RAM) and it's fine, but I'd like a more dedicated machine. More specifically, I'd like to do some large-scale network automation exercises, so to run CML2 or GNS3 I would ideally like 128GB of RAM, but 64GB would be a minimum.
 I've found most mini PC's can get up to 16/32, but not as many with 64 or 128. Any good recommendations ahead of Cyber Monday?
 My budget is preferably <$500. I can pull 32GB of DDR4 from my desktop (and upgrade in the process) and I have SSD's/M.2 drives, so I'm not concerned about storage. Thanks!
 Edit: I think I may have found one that might fit my needs - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09NKQQSQP/ref=emc_b_5_i?th=1
 I'm thinking worst case, if I outgrow it, I can easily turn this thing into a replacement for my Raspberry Pi retro gaming station.

 I am looking into purchasing a HD to simply store data and put it away, like photos and videos. But I am unsure what would be the best drive for this situation, as I don’t have too much background with HD, and there is a bunch of HDs to choose from. I came across these two seeing their price and reviews. 
 One is the 2TB WD easystore at BB and the other is this Lacie HD at Apple, I was also looking into the Lacie Rugged. I can get this one for 60 because of a discount.
 Any one can recommend any of these, or anything else? I am open to suggestions.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow Denizens of r/DataHoarder
 I just bought 2x14tb WD drives, that I'm adding to my NAS, which is running OMV. It currently only has an 8tb drive in it, on EXT4, which is almost out of space.
 I've been looking into snapraid-btrfs and snapraid-btrfs-runner.
 This and Mergerfs seems to be the perfect combination for my use case of mainly media storage(and maybe a steam cache later) on mixed drive sizes.
 But this is my first time even having enough data/drives to even have to worry about parity/bitrot, so i want to make sure I do it right the first time.
 I have a few things I want to make sure I'm understanding properly.
 1) So in Snapraid, a 'Sync' is basically creating/updating the parity data on the parity drive. Does updating a parity file go faster if little to nothing has changed on the data drives?
 2) Snapraid 'Scrubs' periodically check the integrity of a file based off of the Parity data, and timestamp. Still don't exactly get how this one works
 3) Snapraid Sync will fail if anything is writing to the drives. Snapraid-btrfs gets around this by having Snapraid take a snapshot of btrfs's Read Only snapshots. No idea if that's correct.
 4) Using Mergerfs and btrfs on my 8tb + 14tb drives, I can fill each drive rather evenly, without striping files. I can use my second 14tb to store the parity file created by Snapraid-btrfs. This should be pretty protected against bitrot, and the rare drive failure, right?(other than files lost between a sync and a failure)
 Sorry this is so long winded. I appreciate any insight :)

 I see 2 options. 
 A- 1 disk dedicated to each VM
 B- 4 disks with RAID0 or any stripping option, pooled together and the pool is used by the 4 VMs. 
 Option B makes more sense in terms of storage. 
 But in terms of pure performance, which one do you think is better ?
 Edit 1: Additional information: - The 4 VMs are desktops. - 99% tiny files constantly read and written. - each ssd is directly connected in sata to the motherboard. - all ssd are in the 370-450 MB/s speed range (simple hdparm test speed) - I do not want any redundancy. Just max speed.

I tried compressing a small 49GB set with 7zip and it compressed to 12GB. These are the RAW files that aren't used too often (they are mostly processed and the processed version is what we used. however, since they are data, we want to keep the raw files too). Is there any downside to compressing the raws, and deleting the raws after to save space? I saw couple of posts but most dealt with low compression ratios and not worth it. But i think saving 60-70% in my case might be. I am just worried about unforseen comsequences i might not be aware of. Like accessing files, likelihood or corruption or whatnot.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sorry, I am new in all of this and I am not from english speaking country, so I apologize if I say something incorrect.
 I would like to ask you for a advice, because I am bit lost in this scenario:
 In my computer, I have this three drivers, encrypted by BitLocker: 
  
A: 500GB SSD - Samsung 860 EVO
 B: 1TB HDD - WD 1003FZEX
 C: 10TB HDD - WD 102KRYZ
  
OS: Windows 11 Pro
 Motherboard: MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4
 Would it be possible, to mirror the drive A to the drive C through some kind of a software, where if needed, I would create a basic partition on the drive C so it would be the same size with the drive A. The same scenario I would like to use for the drive B to C, same as A to C. But the data on drive A are the most critical for me and I would like them to survive the trial of time with naively ideally no corruption and so on.
 I understand backups are vital in this, but one of the problems at this time is money, so unfortunately right now, something like NAS is out of question for me. (Note: The 102KRYZ. It was a gift from colleague of mine.) Second problem is, if bit rot happens, even with backups, I will have no idea about it and the backups would get overwritten through time, so ideally, the software for the mirroring should check for checksum, if I understand it correctly.
 Space in the PC is basically taken, so adding later another 500GB SSD would be a bit difficult. Thats why I would like to ask about this scenario and how I could utilize the setup I have to the best of capabilities in protecting my data. 
 If this scenario is impossible, then maybe, is there a software for just plainly generating checksum and warning the user, if the files gets corrupted, so you could overwrite it from the backup from other drivers? Just a thought.
 I will be very thankful for any idea, answer or anything to my problem. Thank you if you read my post and If I may, I wish you a very nice day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, been doing quite a bit of reading to determine which solution would be best for me to publish my internal web/media servers. I couldn't find a discussion comparing them here in homelab. 
 It looks like the big players are: * SWAG - https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/swag * NGINX Proxy Manager - https://nginxproxymanager.com/ * Traefik - https://traefik.io/
 So here I am looking for some reviews and Pros/Cons from the community. What do you use/like and why? 
 Me personally, I work in tech, but focus windows side. Limited experience with Linux, Docker, Web, Networking, so not an expert in this realm, but happy to learn. Thanks!

 Are there any selfhosted eye-candy type of apps out there? Geiss in a browser window, screensaver type stuff, or just general cute/interesting animations that can be accessed from systems/devices on the network?
 I can think of many different ways to accomplish this and I may just end up making something myself. However, I'd love to see what's out there first! 
 Thanks for any recommendations, you all have a great weekend! I'll just be here jamming out to 90s music in WinAmp.. the way it was intended by everyone except Lars. IYKYK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've not long started putting together my own little lab and want to ensure I am putting security first as while lurking I've read many horror stories.
 I'm running a small server that I put together myself (I'll post specs in a comment below).
 On this server I am currently running Proxmox with 1 VM and 1 LXC.
 The VM is running Ubuntu Server 22.04 (Minimal Install) and atm is only running Home Assistant via Docker with a couple of other containers that are used within HA.
 The LXC is just a monitoring tool I am running to check the Ubiquiti store as I can never seem to get a G4 Pro Doorbell as scalpers will be scalpers.
 After installing the Ubuntu VM I have a list of tasks I carried out to aid in the security first approach:
  
Setup unattended-upgrades
 Configure SSH via keys using ed25519
 Disable password access to SSH
 Install and setup basic rules for UFW and Fail2Ban
 Disable root login.
  
The same steps are applied to the actual Proxmox server where possible (Disable root login wasn't possible).
 ​
 Going forward I am looking to expand and add Plex or Jellyfin that would ideally be accessible externally (I know, not exactly security first here). I hear a lot about using reverse proxies, VPNs etc but its not an area I am familiar with and many YouTube videos seems to explain it differently so I have chickened out for the time being as not to get it wrong.
 Finally I am debating if there is a need to create another Ubuntu VM to installer another instance of Docker for all my other future applications so I can keep Home Assistant and its companion containers segregated.
 ​
 Apologies for the long and boring post.
 TLDR
 Newb labber, using Proxmox, trying to keep secure.
 Using HA, expanding to external access Plex/Jelli.
 Seeking advice on ReverseProxy/VPN and other security tips.

 I currently use my PC to serve Plex to my family, but am looking to move that to the Beelink (I got the SEi12 instead of a Ryzen box to take advantage of QuickSync). I'm also looking to host my own Bitwarden, Lightning wallet, DNS, usenet, cloud storage... basically anything I can.
 I use 3.5" HDDs to store video and large files. Obviously those will not fit inside the little Beelink. Whats the best solution for housing HDDs? Would a DS220j work? Or something similar?
 TLDR; setting up first home server. Best way to attach storage (NAS? Just external drives by USB?) to something like a Beelink SEi12? Appreciate any advice!

 What do you recommend? FreeIPA seems to be a resource hog but the best one I've seen so far.
 Should I use a cloud provider like jumphost, that allows for 10 free users?
 Any other cool projects or recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all so I'm taking the leap and going to buy a rack. I am looking for two cases, one to transfer my NAS into so it should have a few drive bays I've seen quite a few online and I'm pretty happy with some of them, but I'm also considering putting my PC into the rack as well so that I have ample space on my desk. So I have a couple of questions regarding this:
  
The case, I see a lot of server cases but they all have lots of HDD slots and are kind of overkill from what I can see, maybe I should be looking for a 2U or 3U for a PC case. I would like to make sure I can fit whatever available GPU I have and maybe some things like NIC cards or other pcie devices and don't want to end up restricted. I'd be inserting a regular ATX motherboard.
 
Will this work? I want to have some kind of small type c device on my desk that will deal with monitors mouse etc connecting back to the server rack (same room not too far) and maybe even type c powered monitors for a very minimal cabling job.
 
 I keep getting caught in a googling loop with type c docking stations when I look for devices that essentially just give me all the ports I'd need over type c so maybe someone has a better idea of what these are called.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. Currently have a ds920 with 4 16tb exos drives in raid 10. I’m getting close to 20tb storage and am going to need more space. I also sometimes wish transcoding worked a bit faster with my nas on some files so I won’t have buffering. Not a common problem. My question is should I go with a bigger nas, just get an expansion bay, or is it time to go custom? I’ve built many pcs but I’ve never messed with Linux or other nas software. None of the data is critical, but I would like to keep some form of raid in case a drive fails. Anyone have any opinions or tips for me?

I see a lot of posts here and on Home Lab about virtualization. As a techie by trade this seems like overkill to me for my needs. Dockerizing everything seems fine but I didn’t know if there were added benefits to virtualizing over this. With a pretty simple machine (specs not on hand), would virtualizing kill my resources where they should just be running in Docker?
 Idk. Just really confused and looking for general reasons why to choose virtualization, docker, everything all on one is, etc.

 But now I need some little help to find a wiki for documentantion that will include the following requirements:
  
selfhosted
 online editing
 don't have that red section (which almost every wiki with the above requirements contains)!
 fast (confluence is lagging when you have big documentation)
  
good to have:
  
support for markdown
 db support
  
Unfortunately, I don't like bookstack. I can't convince myself of its ui.

 For that I wanted to see if there is some kind of selfhosted flatshare tool. The basic things Id like to have it do is chore managment (ideally with some kind of automatic redistribution if someone is on holiday and not just a set date but a timespan in which the chorse should be completed) and some kind money & shared groceries managment (for example every week someone else is supposed to buy toilet paper and gets a reminder but somebody could also do it for them and then the amount owed is added to the money balancer) and finally maybe some kind of shared note taking.
 Does anything like this exist already, I havet found anything on my search so far. It could also be a couple different services, as long as its easy to use in house for non-technical people :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered the whole world of Docker containers and I find them extremely useful for quickly deploying and managing stuff, however, it's a bit painful to be manually ssh-ing into the machines and adding a docker compose or running the containers, plus configuring them to run on reboot etc.
 Is there anything to manage this kind of stuff across multiple nodes? So I can, let's say, have now 3 machines but in the future add some more and manage their containers from some UI or something.
 Thanks in advance.
 EDIT: After seeing lots of comments and wrapping my head around Portainer, Kubernetes even Podman, I think for now I'm going to go with Portainer because:
 1- It seems simpler, since it's just Docker and I've been using that for the past months
 2- Kubernetes seems more suitable when you need to manage a cluster and big stuff, add like HA to your services, and overall, too complex for my use case. However, I really liked the idea, and I'll definitely try it out for fun when I have some time
 3- Also I've seen that regarding memory usage, Kubernetes tend to hog more than plain Docker, and that's a concern for me since I plan on using Raspberrys for now (or at least until I have enough money to get a decent home server)
 Thanks again to all of you that commented, I have still a lot to learn!

 I own a raspberry pi b version 1 (512mb) which I use for the UniFi remote and guest portal. I also would like to use it for other things but I see that I run the boundaries of the pi.
 Therefore i want to upgrade to either - a newer version raspberry like rpi 4b 8gb - an alternative like odroid H3+ - or a thin client like - Fujitsu Esprimo Q920 0-Watt Intel Core i5 240GB SSD 8GB RAM link: https://amzn.eu/d/byXAt4b - Dell OptiPlex 9020-SFF, Intel Core i5-4570 3.2GHZ, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD link: https://www.amazon.com/Dell-OptiPlex-9020-SFF-i5-4570-Windows/dp/
 What would I like to do with the new machine? * Docker * UniFi remote + guest portal * Domoticz * Make a small (2TB) NAS. Preferrably with a minimum of 2 disks * Run a Adblocker like pihole * Build up some virtual Linux machines 
 My question is: is this all possible in one of the above options and if so which would be the smartest option?
 I also have been thinking about splitting tasks, with a stand-alone NAS and a thin client, but am very curious about you’re opinions.
 If you have better advices regarding machines, I am also curious for those options!
 Thanks in advance!

My goal was to keep the whole server as compact as possible and self-powered, which is why I chose to go with 2.5" drive cages. It's not the biggest capacity At 14TB of raw storage but it's more than plenty for my needs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My storage needs have outgrown my little 4bay nas and im considering a JBOD system with a virtualized truenas. Im really just having trouble with a few things.
  
Enclosure
 Controller card
  
I plan to start with 6x 20TB drives in a raidz2 so id like some room to grow, redundant power supplies are a must and if possible power efficient when drives are in downtime. Thats the only wishlist for the enclosure but theres supermicro,dell,netapp,ect and im on a budget of about 500 for the enclosure
 As for the controller card Preferably not hardware RAID as I wish to pass the raw drives to the VM and allow truenas to handle it but some recommendations on what that card should be would be great.
 And finally my vm server is a dell r710 with a Zotac 1050Ti inside (incase that helps with options.) Rackspace is not a problem

 I asked this question before but I think it phrased it wrong maybe. Hoping this gets more traction.
 I am considering buying a Dell C6400 chassis with 4 Xeon salable blades. One of the particular questions I have is, how loud does this puppy run. I can think with 2 100W+ CPUs per blade it will be quite loud. Has anyone ever heard these go? 
 4 fans to cool 8 100W+ CPUs seems like quite the challenge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wasn't able to find much data online about doing this, I was given a Dell Powervault 110T LTO2 drive with some tapes for free. (I realize this is a dinosaur, but free is free and I think it's cool) 
 Came with an Adaptec AHA-2940W/2940UW interface card, but it seems to use some different form of PCI connector than any of my modern boards, where the notch is on the inner side furthest from the outside of the case. It has the external 68 pin connector which goes to the external drive, as well as another 68 pin inside along with a 50 pin scsi connector. I'm not sure what these are for, presumably data is transferred through the PCI part. I'm guessing there is some sort of PCI jumper but I'm not sure what to look for. 
 After that, I have no idea what sort of software to use. I do not expect any sort of automation, meaning I'm sure I'll have to divide my data into 200gb chunks to write as opposed to it being done automatically. I'm on linux mint if that matters, but I guess I could use a windows (98?) VM if need be. 
 Again, I know this is ancient technology but I think it'll be cool to have up and running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Sharing a self-hosted project I’ve been building for awhile: ecowitt2mqtt
 TL;DR: this is a small web server that receives data from Ecowitt weather stations & gateways and sends it to an MQTT broker. This allows for local, near-real-time weather data to be sent to any number of applications via MQTT (including full support for Home Assistant MQTT Discovery). Ecowitt gateways can even be used to receive data from white-labeled weather stations, like those from Ambient Weather.
 It has a lot of great features (including several calculated data points that the weather stations don’t provide natively, like how long various skin types can be in the current sun unprotected before burning).
 Enjoy!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I'm trying to figure out how to best set up my Terramaster T6-423 NAS in terms of speed, noise level and longevity of my larger drives (16TB IronWolfs). I'm thinking of adding a 2TB SSD for the "everyday" processes like the system itself, backups of local machines, torrents (seeding from SSD), Plex server, basically all applications running on the NAS and having all my media and data that I archive and stream on the array with my 16TB IronWolfs. This way that volume can sleep when I don't need it while the processes on the SSD run quietly in the background. I'd run mirrored backups of that single SSD once a day with another older drive or external USB for now.
 What do you think, does this make sense? Happy about any feedback.
 Thanks.

        <updated>2022-11-24T23:44:19.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I'm trying to setup an NGINX reverse proxy to my webserver running on an Ubuntu Server 22.04 machine. My internet comes in trough the router I got from my ISP, to which I have connected a separate pfsense firewall and my server is connected to that. Ports 80 and 443 are forwarded on both my ISP router (to the address of the firewall) and the firewall (to the address of my server).
 ​
 I have bought a domain and directed the name to my public ip address using an A record. This works, because I can forward a port (for example 5555) and access it from outside using www.mydomain.com:5555. However, when I try to access just the domain through the NGINX reverse proxy, it doesn't work. When I try to connect to the reverse proxy from inside my network (by just accessing www.mydomain.com) I get sent to the login page of my router. My router doesn't use CGNAT (I think) because when I traceroute my public IP it only takes 1 hop:
 traceroute to my.public.ip (my.public.ip), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets 1 my.public.ip (my.public.ip) 100.108 ms 100.062 ms 100.769 ms 
 My nginx/sites-available/default file looks like this:
 server { listen 80 default_server; listen [::]:80 default_server; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000; proxy_http_version 1.1; } } 
 I have also added the host in my /etc/hosts file. I found that the second line was already there, where it connected 127.0.1.1 to the hostname of my server (I don't know if that is correct or I should remove it). the file is this:
 127.0.0.1 localhost 127.0.1.1 hostname my.public.ip www.mydomain.com 
 The server I want to connect to my reverse proxy is a nodejs server running on address 127.0.0.1 with port 8000. I have allowed NGINX on my firewall:
 Status: active To Action From -- ------ ---- Nginx Full ALLOW Anywhere Nginx Full (v6) ALLOW Anywhere (v6) 
 Does anybody have an idea on how to fix this?

If I grab it in my hand (disconnected of course from power) and turn it upside down and back ... I can hear something inside. It is like a small part knocking something like a small spring sliding up and down on a bar or similar. It is def. not something just flapping around in the breeze but more like something that has a very limited and "controlled" movement. I don't have this in my WD 8TB Gold neither in my Seagate Exos X20 20TB. Could someone check for me? 
 I have a HC550 18 TB too but it is not with me right now but later I'll check it, probably that would be a "fair" comparision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently trying to figure out the best software setup for my server. It looks like I'm going to run Proxmox, and then a VM for windows 10. I also need Plex on the server and some sort of NAS feature. 
 I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how it all interacts. 
 I have my main laptop which I edit video in using adobe suite. It will connect to the server via 10gbe directly to a dual port 10gbe in the server. 
 The server has a HW raid 10(24TB) that I will store all my videos and photos that I'm not currently editing. I will transfer new content to the server, process it into proxies, and send it to the laptop. This will all be controlled by RDP from the laptop. The server will also be used to render the final files via RDP
 Is this simply accomplished by a proxmox install, and a win10 VM? 
 Is the raid 10 volume accesible to Plex if I run it in a container? 
 Is the raid accessible to win10, Plex, and Nas software simultaneously?
 How does GPU access work if I'm using the server to render, and Plex is using the GPU to transcode?
 Is there a way to get simultaneous access to the GPU for win10 environment and the Plex server?
 Is the HW raid a problem in accomplishing this?
 Sorry for the list but it's actually pretty hard to pin down solid answers on my exact use case, and sometimes one variable being different changes the answers to every other question.
 Thanks for your help.

 I have tried searching online but I usually find posts that involve app issues on truenas. I am running truenas scale bare metal on this server.
 I have replaced the power supplies with different ones, i have reseated the cpu's all the ram and addon cards as well as checked every molex/header connection to ensure nothing is loose, and i've tried disconnecting all the drives and it still happens.
 Nothing in the IPMI logs is showing an error. Need some help here if anyone has any clue as to what I could try to fix it or if it maybe just a bad motherboard. Happy Thanksgiving yall!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone confirm EXACTLY what happens when you try to boot a system with a vendor locked AMD EPYC processor? I got a used one off of eBay that did not mention if it was vendor locked or not. I am not sure if that is the issue here, there might be an issue with the motherboard, but it is a possibility. The motherboard is an ASRock brand board.
 Does a debug error display on the motherboard? Is there an error beep code? Does the system completely refuse to power on?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heimdall v2.5.0 has just dropped, let us know how you get on with it.
  
Release notes: https://github.com/linuxserver/Heimdall/releases/tag/v2.5.0
 Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall
 Docker: lscr.io/linuxserver/heimdall:latest
 Discord: https://discord.gg/CCjHKn4
  
Big thanks to https://github.com/keriati for putting in a lot of effort to get things moving again.
 The big changes this release:
  
Updated the underlying framework to Laravel 8, this will be the last version that supports PHP 7.4, v2.6.0 will move to Laravel 9 and require a min of PHP8.0. Just because this version works on PHP7.4 you are still encouraged to use PHP8 instead though
 Updated all the composer and npm dependencies (the latter of which are generally only used in dev)
 Lots of bugs fixed, including one that has been around for 3 years, where cookies would expire and the user would be left with an error 500. Turns out this was an issue when people were running multi-user, it's now finally fixed!
 Some basic keyboard navigation has been added.
 MySQL and PostgreSQL are both now officially supported in addition to SQLite.
 Stop polling when the API returns an error.
 Added a bunch of translations, some of the strings had to be google translated as some were missing though.
 A bunch of fixes have been applied to apps, such as the password field should work properly now.
 There is also a background job that updates old config files if newer ones have been released.
 Private apps and app development has been fixed
 There are instructions for running without external access to the app, however things like automatically downloading icons wont work in that case. This is also experimental, so let us know if we can improve this.
 Doing a tile search will now open the first item in the search results instead of returning an error.

 Using Molex molded splitters are a hazard, crimped splitters are safer, however, some comments have had a bad experience with using molex splitting among drives. So then some reddit users recommend different sources for custom cables, yet, when you still get people saying that you should make your own since custom cables are not a good. Then some say not to have but only one splitter for each power supply. 
 I am confused because it seems like doomed if you do and doomed if you don't scenario.

 Now i have a use-case where i need to process the response of one service (get an IP address from the response body) and then check if that IP is reachable on a specific port.
 Does anyone know a slightly more dynamic monitoring system, that lets you do this? Would be great to also have notifications like Uptime Kuma has.

 I used to be able to download videos from Instagram stories by simply Inspecting, finding the video and downloading it. However, they seem to have made an update to how they display videos (both stories and actual posts): Instead of GETing the usual .mp4 video from their servers, they now do it by serving a stream of bytes like so: https://i.imgur.com/H4iAUUF.jpg
 My question is, how can I download these pieces and merge them properly?
 Thank you!

 I have right now a 2x (12x 1.2TB 10K RPM SAS RAID-Z2) storage under TrueNAS Scale, it works really well I have no quips about it.
 But I also run a bunch of Docker containers. * Jellyfin * Calibre * 2x Sonarr (TV & Anime) * Radarr * Flexget * Stashapp * 4x qbittorrent instances (over 6k torrents)
 I think storage is becoming a bottleneck.
 So I was thinking of moving all the dockers to a SSD.
 I also have like 16+ VM's that I would like faster performance so is Fusion-IO a good choice or I should go with some other model? (I trust Fusion-IO devices on ESXi 6.x I have a bussiness clients running on them and they have performed flawlessly!) 
 I have been looking at ebay and I think I can get them at a good price 3~TB @ $200ish

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there
 I've been trying out different photo galleries, but none really managed to do what I hope to achieve. For some context, I have a huge library of artworks and content of different artists online (some might call that Linux ISOs). I have everything on my server, but I need a tool to easily view these from a browser.
 Those few photo management solutions that support existing directory structure, all have some kind of downside.
 - Nextcloud photos can't actually use the correct alphanumerical sorting and goes from "1 (1).png" to "1 (10).png" instead of "1 (2).png". The issue for that seems to be stale or just forgotten because it's open for like 3 years -.-
 - PhotoView has some problems with displaying large directories, as it makes giant database queries every time you switch a directory
 - Lychee is quite nice, but its import process is just too slow. With a library of around 300k images and videos, it takes for ever to import that once, but every consecutive one takes forever as well…
 - PiGallery2 is the only one that seems to be fast enough with what experience I want, but still some of the tasks in the background for indexing or general preview generation also takes a long time.
 ​
 Just to clarify, I don't need syncing to my phone or whatever other features solutions like Immich has. I just need something to quickly browse a giant library of photos and videos.
 Are there any solutions I haven't come across, that could help me in this case?

 This gets mapped as a network drive to my computer. I am the only user.
 As a result, all folders/files are exposed when the drive is mapped. I consider this an unnecessary risk for the following reasons:
  
99% of my files are archives, and don't need them to be mounted and available 24/7
 The files are irreplaceable
 Ransomware would have access to my entire universe of files
 Fat finger accidents can affect my entire universe of files
  
Before you ask -- yes! I have a solid backup strategy in place. But I still think it makes sense to reduce the surface area for a potential disaster.
 Here are a couple of strategies that I have been kicking around:
  
Create a read-only user account, and use that most of the time
 Create multiple user accounts, one for each high level folder, eg: 
 /Photos --> only allow rw access to 'user1'
 /Videos --> only allow rw access to 'user2'
 /Documents --> only allow rw access to 'user3'
 ...this would contain any potential damage to just one folder
 
  
​
 I am curious if others have a similar approach, or have thought about reducing the surface area to an as-needed basis.

 Hi I bought a 8TB SMR drive from Seagate due to huge sale. Product ID is STKR8000400 (should be identical with STKP8000400). Links are to datasheets. Couldn't find out what disk is inside.It's only going to be used on one PC (backup for myself, casual user). No raid or special stuff.I already spent 2 hours trying to learn and find answers, so im asking this for myself and future googlers :)
 I read in this reddit post the optimal way to transfer files is
 large sequential writes.If you keep your writes large enough to write an entire track at a time it doesn't need rewriting and you won't get a slow down.

        <updated>2022-11-24T13:43:27.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a Linux box that runs 3 pairs of 4 TB disks, each pair set to RAID1 with the Linux software RAID (mdadm). I'd like to convert them to a single ZFS pool with 2 parity disks without losing the data in the process, to make it easy to upgrade in the future and to gain extra capacity (would jump from 11 TB to about 15).
 1st question is about the conversion. I'm planning to degrade all three RAID1 arrays to a single disk and use the freed disks to initialize a RAIDz2. I would copy over the files from the first RAID1 array then add the remaining disk of that array to the ZFS pool. Then repeat for the other two arrays.
 Is this doable? It's not clear to me if ZFS will let me start a RAIDz2 with only 3 disks... If I have to start with RAIDz1 can I convert it to RAIDz2 later "live"?
 2nd question is about ZFS portability. What I like about mdadm is that you can install any Linux distro and it will pick up the existing arrays right away, they aren't "tied" in any way to a specific driver or hardware. Is ZFS the same? If I create a pool on one distro and then switch to a completely different one (or dual-boot) will the other one pick up the ZFS pool without a hitch?
 TIA for any insight.

 Are there such cheap cards which have IT mode without having to mess with and flash firmware?
 Edit: I am new to these type of cards and RAID in general, so forgive any nonsense I might say:
 What I am looking for is to be able to connect used SAS drives cheaply to my PC and use them in RAID either in software RAID like ZFS or with actual RAID controller (but is there cheap RAID controller that can be plugged to my PC?)

 I have two options with the 14tb - shuck an easystore (wd140edgz, 7200) or a 5400rpm red plus (not sure of model - maybe wd140effx?) 
 Beyond the warranty (3yr for red plus, 2yr for shucked), is there a big enough difference in them to warrant one over the other? The red plus cost me $10 more so they are virtually the same price.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I'm taking my first steps into the world on self-hosting with a RP4+OMV (running on a SD card)+SSD for storage.. and so far, I'm loving the experience and the challenge! I'm learning a lot!
 I'm currently running the following services:
  
Plex + Tautulli + Overseerr 
 RFlood + Sonarr + Radarr + Readarr + Prowlarr 
 Nginx Proxy Manager 
 Nextcloud 
 Photoprism
  
The latter of which I suspect is giving me some problems regarding resource usage: my RP4 frequently runs out of RAM and I'd love to know which container is responsible.
 My questions are as follows:
  
Do you think I'm running too many services?
 How do you monitor your containers? I'm considering grafana+prometheus but they look pretty intimidating to set-up.
  
Let me know your thoughts! Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, thanks in advance for any advice. I'm not new to building PCs but don't consider it a hobby, just something I do in order to have a PC.
 I'm building for a new work rig (high end editing/creation), and putting 3x 6TB Ironwolf drives in there for storage of mostly photo and video files along with SSDs for files currently being worked on.
 I don't want to be playing around all day with the RAID setup, I just want something that works and will allow me to recover if one of the drives die. And yes I know that RAID is not backup! The important files are going in the cloud, also it's not critical data to start with (once the jobs are delivered).
 I'm really attracted to the idea of just using windows storage spaces in parity mode, especially now that I found this article and this one shamelessly ripped off the prior article with no credit but does conveniently have the numbers I'd need for my 3 disk setup to run with better speeds, because let's be honest it was NOT easy wrapping my head around the original article.
 Am I right that this is the right solution for a data noob like myself with my 3 disks? What else should I consider that doesn't involve becoming an expert? Things like TrueNas etc just seem like they're way above my paygrade, and I get conflicting information on hardware raid controller PCI cards (e.g. that it would be difficult to recover in case the card itself dies). I understood doing a mobo based raid is suicide.
 Thanks in advance for helping out this n00b!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I need help deploying this docker container in my homeserver. Briefkasten is a self-hosted bookmarking application (Demo). Briefkasten has a lot of nice features that I would like to host in my network but I'm not experienced with building my own docker files. Especially those with a lot of dependencies.
 I'm using Portainer as my container manager and using docker compose files (stacks) in Portainer to keep my docker configs for every container (this helps me with my backups). All of my container images are hosted on DockerHub, which made my life until now easier. 
 I would like to have everything in a stack (a single docker compose file) and I don't want anything to be hosted/running on my server directly. 
 Can you please provide some help on how to build the container and have everything running in docker? I have absolutely no idea how to build a NextAuth.js container and connect a DB..
 ​
 The container's Prerequisites:
  
To self-host this application, you'll need the following thins: 
 - Server / hosting platform for a Next.js application (i.e. Vercel / Netlify) 
 - For OAuth login, a developer account at any one of the providers supported by NextAuth.js 
 - Database that works with Prisma (i.e. MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, etc.) 
 - Image hosting space (i.e. Supabase / ImageKit / Cloudinary) (optional) 
  
​
 Thank you, I appreciate the help!
 Edit: Typo

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have Vikunja working in that the frontend and backend are running and working, it's sat behind an Nginx reverse proxy and I've been using it from the computer. I had it set up locally initially, until I secured it a bit and then added a subdomain on the host and allowed external access. Everything still works using the external FQDN and I also changed the URL in the env variables in Portainer.
 Trying it from an Android mobile (on the same network) using Opera/Chrome/Kiwi and the frontend loads but says it cannot connect to the backend. By default I still had the local LAN IP configured in the env variables. Changed this to the docker network address and also the external FQDN (after forwarding ports) and they all worked on desktop still but none of them worked on mobile. Changed the address on the error page the frontend loaded and also changed the env options in Portainer.
 I'm not sure what to look at now. As I said at the top, the frontend and backend are talking as it works on the desktop.

I routinely keep 3 - 5 connected at a time and am trying to find some way of storing them which would allow easily swapping them out. My ideal would be a mini "Rack Mount" system similar to mounted servers, but for 3x4 usb drives. Any suggestions are welcome.

I'm thinking getting a bigger case allowing for quieter fans, as well as removing the SAS conversion and using the supplied SATA interface is the way to go. (The trays are missing as well) Any recommendation for a case below $200 with quiet fans? I see a bunch on ebay but not sure if they are any good. Also wondering if the power supply should be kept or replaced with something more efficient. I'm thinking 650 watts is a lot for a NAS. This is a DDR3 server so I'm thinking it's worth saving and using. 
 I've done server builds before using PC parts but this will be my first one using proper server hardware.

Basically I am hoping to find a way to back up an iCloud folder containing thousands of notes. There is a method for doing this with individual files, but I have not been able to find a way to Select All. (I have found a converter service that backs up Notes to txt files, but that loses formatting and attachments.) I keep the Notes on iCloud for the syncing across devices. 
 Similarly, I'd love to back up my iCloud library of 1000s of epubs and pdfs, ideally with highlights and comments intact. 
 Thanks for any suggestions on either!

 I have the .yml file and all it's contents I just don't know where to start 
 never used Portainer but I have used Docker with other linux applications and game server panels. 
 here's a screenshot of what I see in Portainer below:

Recently I had the great idea of instead of renting GPU time for personal projects if I just built a home server with decent GPUs. My main two goals with this server are to be able to run ml projects locally and to host virtual machines for ros and gazebo. I’d prefer to do those on vms as I typically use a macbook 
 I do have a decent amount of experience in Linux and Unix so I think from a software sys admin side I am comfortable. From a hardware side I am significantly less experienced and this is where I would need the majority of help/suggestions.
 Budget isn’t a major concern I don’t have endless resources but I understand a ml server with gpus isn’t cheap l.

However I'm concerned regarding how long I should wait before getting a new drive. I've read online that hard drives generally last about 3 - 5 years but I'm not sure what they mean by that. It could mean the drive will become unusable after that period but it could also mean that that's just the time it'll take until bit rot sets in after that period of time passes in cold storage.
 What do you guys think? When should I start thinking about getting a new drive and transferring my files to it?

For about a year I kept track of every city or town I went to and recently started cataloguing every park, restaurant or store I go to as well. I use an app called Pin Traveller which so far has been really great and easy but from the looks of the website and app store page it doesn't seem to be regularly active and I have a big fear that the servers will shut down one day and I'll lose all my pins. How can I back up the info somehow? I don't believe the app has any interface for such a thing and I would rather die than manually put down every pin somewhere else. Maybe somebody knows a better app for putting pins on a map that is frequently updated or has a way to back up the data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Newbie from Mexico here. I own a Synology DS413j with 3 Western Digital 6TB drives and one Seagate 3 TB using Synology Hybrid Raid. The problem is that this NAS has a very small CPU, very little RAM, so it is really S-L-O-W. Even when doing a small backup from my PC to the NAS, on a 100Mbps network (not even 1Gbps), the CPU jumps to almost 100%. Also, since it's a "j" (junior) version I can't run docker or anything else in it.
 So, I'm planning to replace it, and I have 2 options (of course, if you have a better one, I'm all ears).
 Option A: A new Synology Model ("+" plus version), with 4 or 5 bays. This is somewhat expensive here in Mexico, but as far as I know, in February we'll have the DS922+ available. Since I don't use transcoding, there is no problem for me with the AMD CPU of the DS922.
 Option B: Build my own NAS, maybe using Truenas or Nextcloud. 
 My main usage is:
 a) Backup all my home's computers (1 desktop, 2 laptops)
 b) Storing files and cloud (my own personal Dropbox)
 c) Storing my music, so I can play it on my computers or my android phone (I use DS Audio for that)
 d) Storing and organizing my photos that I take on my phone (instead of Google Photos). I use DS Photo for this.
 e) As my own personal "Evernote", with DS Note on android and windows.
 What would be a better option: buy another Synology or build my NAS? 
 Thanks!

 so recently I bought a old NAS to finally clean up my external HDD project mess and have a place to backup my photos. But, to be honest, I'm very new to the idea of self-hosting and trying to figure out if this NAS would be suitable to install eg. Nextcloud on it, as it's own web software (Iomega Personal Cloud) is no longer supported and has security vulnerabilities.
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, I'm back with another question. I recently got a T610 virtually for free. It has no drives and it's my first proper homelab. I intend to use unRAID.
 It is the 8x2.5" model, and I'm not happy with capacity or speed on 2.5 inch drives.
 I have done some research and want to make sure what I'm thinking will work and be beneficial. I'd like to get an expansion enclosure such as the Dell MD1200. 
 The T610 currently has a 6i raid controller, so I know I need to upgrade it. Should I go with an H200 in IT mode or is there a better option?
 I guess I may be overcomplicating things, but I'm open to any and all suggestions. I'm wanting to do things the best way possible with the T610. I also am sure I'll upgrade in the future. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, my PC recently suffered a drive failure when I was preparing to set it up as a dual-boot PC. Fortunately, I manually backed up everything during the preparation just before the drive failed unexpectedly. 
 Originally, my PC had two SSDs and one HDD all backing up onto an external USB HDD. I was using the Windows "File History" program at the time. 
 While Windows File History was good at saving media files like photos, music, videos, documents, etc... I found that File History was a little finicky when I was trying to get it to back-up all the files on my PC. I tend to play a lot of games on my PC and I like to backup the game files so I don't lose my game progress. Each game tends to save its progress in its own special save-file, usually inside of the "Program Files" folder. Windows …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Autocorrect messed up my title. Thanks Autocorrect. 
 So yeah, basically as the title states... when I'm downloading for my movie or TV show collection, I'm super picky and always download the absolute highest quality I can find. This often ends up with me having super high bitrate 4K HDR Dolby Atmos 5.1 movies and what not.
 The Synology is of course connected directly to my router via Ethernet (ASUS GT-AXE-1100) and then that is connected to my Apple TV 4K also via Ethernet to that router. Cat6 Ethernet cables, sub 1.5 foot runs. Synology DS1520+, Intel Celeron J4125 (2ghz clock speed lol), 8 GB of RAM.
 Everything running on Plex.
 So I've got my bad ass files, a big huge 4K HDR TV, and the device and software to play it, but I can't play them properly. They are constantly having to stop for buffering, and don't even get me started on trying to stream them remotely.
 Obviously I can (and have) "optimized"/converted a lot of the files over to 20mbps 1080p, but what's the awesomeness of having a 60GB super high bitrate 4K HDR movie, and all the gear to watch it, if I can't watch it properly?
 Anything I'm doing wrong? Is the Synology NAS itself not up to the task, is it a networking issue that can be resolved? Would an SSD cache drive improve things? Upgrade the RAM? CPU not up to the task? Maybe if the HDD's are the limiting factor I can throw in an SSD drive dedicated for these files?
 Maybe I'm just making a dumb mistake somewhere.
 Obviously I can just encode them with handbrake to a lower bitrate or something, but that's just a pain in the ass and I just want to enjoy my movies in all their glory.
 Any pointers would be appreciated.

 Next month I’ll visit relatives in another country where things are much more relaxed. I’m thinking about using an old machine as a remote torrent client, connected to my local server’s (running unraid) sonarr and syncthing.
 How do I securely set up remote access? What operating system would be easiest to safely set up? 
 I’ve done some digging on the sub but didn’t find something as beginner friendly as I’d like. 
 Heard about Tailscale but don’t know much about it. 
 It would be great to get some input and be pointed in the right direction.
 Thanks!

 I can get a good deal on an HP StoreOnce 5100 G9 LFF server, but I wanted to know if it is locked to running HP's proprietary "StoreOnce" Backup OS, or if It's just a standard LFF DL180 (I'm assuming) Gen 9? I can't really find out too much about StoreOnce systems aside from as ESXI backup servers.
 Ideally, I'd like to run ESXI on it, with the VM datastores being stored on NVME in the PCI-E slots, and passing through the HBA (not the stock HP as it isn't a HBA) connected to the front 12 bays to a TrueNAS VM. Or something like that, maybe I'll try Hyper-V or Linux KVM instead.
 Don't wanna waste my time buying it if it's locked to the proprietary OS.
 Thanks!

 I found some ConnectX 2 QSFP VPI cards for dirt cheap on ebay and am looking for some cheap cables to connect them. I have found several cables declared as QSFP SAS cables. Can I use those to connect the two cards? 
 I also read about SFP cables only being compatible with one manufacturer. The cables I'm looking at are "NetApp X6558-R6".
 I know the ConnectX 2 is quite old now but I can get them for 9€ each while ConnectX 3 cards are still 60€ or more. The specific cards I'm looking at are "IBM Mellanox ConnectX-2 VPI HCA (81Y1533)", will these even work in my case? 
 If the cables I posted won't work, what are some cheap cables I should get?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks,
 I am working on building out a couple of servers for my lab. I've been looking at these E52699 v3 procs (18core/36thread). These will be for Proxmox VMs and my truenas setup running a bunch of docker services. The question is... in 2022 (almost 2023), are these procs still worth buying and using for this type of workload, or should I look at spending a bit more on newer processors/motherboards? I found prices for the cpu @ $88 USD, and a supermicro board for $180.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just a quick survey to understand device counts in typical home labs.
 How many: Windows hosts, Linux hosts, and other devices do you have running in your lab?
 My friend told me 50 would be the upper limit, but I disagree. 50 might be higher than the average, but someone out there will probably have more. 
 For myself: 5 physical Windows servers, 5 devices (router, switch, managed power, temperature probes), 1 VMWare server (NUC), two Linux VMs, 4 Windows VMs (each Windows VM hosts 250 IP addresses!) 
 So 17 'things' in the lab, but over 1000 IPs :)

 I got this old pc for free it was going in the trash. It’s a 4 core 4 thread i5-3470, 256gb hard drive, 8gb of ram. I ordered 36gb of crucial ram, 18TB seagate IronWolf Pro NAS hard drive, and a 500 GB ssd. Newegg has some pretty good Black Friday deals. Got the ram for 60 bucks, hard drive for 300, SSD for 26 dollars. My plan is to use the hard drive and 3 cores as a plex server and NAS. Then 1 core and the SSD for a Minecraft server for the kids. So far I’m having a blast with this home lab stuff it’s a lot of fun setting up Proxmox and everything.

 I had one storage server for home use, but now i am adding two more and I want to add a load balancer in front of them so i just have to connect via SFTP to one address and the LB should automatically return the actual server with the least amount occupied disk space. Instead me manually checking ok which server had the least amount of disk space everytime i want to add something, or maybe cluster them somehow so they all appear as one device? 
 I was thinking like proxy server with a python script that queries my 3 storage server's disk util but I am not sure if that's do able? i use file zilla and opnsense fw. 
 my design is not very clear right now just wondering how others would approach this issue.

I would like to route everything except for the WebUI traffic through wireguard (which sits in a docker container. I'm using jordanpotter/wireguard). Unfortunately pretty much every docker wireguard setup tutorial that I've come across suggests using the wireguard container's network stack by applying network_mode: "service:vpn" to the relevant containers, and then using ports: - "127.0.0.1:8080:8888" to expose the WebUI ports to the host, and the reverse proxy picks it up from that point. I would like to avoid unnecessarily exposing ports to the host, however, if possible. Others suggest setting up wireguard on the host but I'd rather have everything in docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking at the MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN as a cheap way to add 10Gb connectivity to a couple pieces of my homelab, mostly NAS and workstation, but there are a couple things I'm unclear on.
  
Can the 1Gb RJ45 port be used as the uplink to the rest of the network? Most of the devices on my network are gigabit and my internet is sub-gigabit, so I really wouldn't need anything higher than gigabit for the uplink.
 Can the SFP+ ports run at 2.5Gb or 5Gb speeds or just 1/10Gb? I have a couple devices that have built-in 2.5Gb nics and it'd be cool to be able to use those at their full speed.
 How hot does it actually get? A lot of my mounting solutions are 3D printed in ABS, so anything under 100C is technically ok, but I'm just wondering if anyone has measured the case temperature.
 Lastly, if I were to put 4x optical transceivers in it, would it still be able to run off POE? I'm wondering how much headroom it has in terms of power for the transceivers, either optical or RJ45 copper.

 PSA: Verbatim no longer sells real M Discs, now puts regular BD-Rs in M Disc packaging
 c't-Magazin followed up on this and spoke to Verbatim:
  
Auf Anfrage stellte Verbatim jedoch klar, dass es sich bei diesen Medien um Weiterentwicklungen handele. Die technischen Änderungen führten zu einem anderen Aussehen und der Fähigkeit für höhere Brenngeschwindigkeiten, die veränderte Medien-ID sei auf eine Anpassung an andere Verbatim-Produkte zurückzuführen. Die ersten veränderten Medien hat Verbatim bereits Anfang 2022 ausgeliefert. Die Datensicherheit der neuen Scheiben steht jener der alten Scheiben nicht nach: Daten sollen nach Angaben des Herstellers ebenfalls 1000 Jahre halten.
  
Translation:
  
Verbatim clarified that these discs were advancements. The technical changes resulted in a different appearance and the ability for higher burning speeds, the changed media-ID was due to an adaptation with regard to other Verbatim products. Verbatim had already shipped the first modified media in early 2022. The data security of the new discs is not inferior to that of the old discs: Data should also last 1000 years, according to the manufacturer.
  
We will update you, should there be any new developments in this story.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, it’s Eldad from the Appwrite team 👋
 I’m happy to share that we just released Appwrite 1.1 with a fully redesigned console for Appwrite, the almost full open-source alternative for Firebase. Since the very beginning, the goal of Appwrite has been to create a new type of backend development experience. One with fewer barriers and friction, more productivity and innovation.
 The new Appwrite Console in v1.1
 Appwrite is not just an open-source, self-hosted alternative to Firebase. We also want to create a simpler experience for developers of all experience levels. Appwrite should guide developers to make better decisions with less frustration.
 To help us achieve this goal, we collaborated with our awesome open-source community on GitHub to completely redesign our Web UI to reflect our core values.
 In Appwrite Console 2.0, we redesigned our:
 🖥️ Dashboard
 🔐 Authentication
 💽 Databases
 🪣 Storage
 ⚡ Functions
 🧙 New Wizards
 ... and more!
 Console 2.0 is designed to minimize friction, increase collaboration, simplify open source contribution, and emphasize Appwrite’s most important value: **simplicity**.
 We’d love to hear what you think of our new UI. We’ll continue to evolve our developer experience, and we’d love your feedback.

 Currently I'm using Intel NUC8i5BEH with Ubuntu 18.04 as my home server (Plex, *arrs, wireguard etc.) and bought another old NUC where I installed Proxmox to get a bit familiar with the hypervisor. 
 I'm looking to build my first Home Server with NAS that will be:
 1. Small - preferably Mini-ITX, but I'm open to small cases that can fit Micro-ATX boards.
 2. Power efficient - I pay $0.55 per kWH :/ 
 As I plan to install TrueNAS VM within Proxmox I thought about the following:
 1. ASRock Z690M-ITX/ax LGA 1700 Intel Z690
 2. LSI 9211-8i to connect drives to and use PCI-E passthrough
 3. 3 x 8TB WD Red Plus 7200 RPM 3.5"
 4. WD BLACK SN750 NVMe SSD 512GB (from another machine that I'm getting rid off)
 5. Intel i3-12100

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently run Traefik as a reverse proxy to expose all my home services to the web. Nothing fancy and it works great.
 Now, I also have a k8s cluster with a Traefik ingress controller that I want to use to expose some services on a different domain.
 My idea was to use the first instance of Traefik that is open to the web, and route all traffic for the second domain to the second reverse proxy managed in kubernetes.
 I can't really think of a better way to do this, besides doing all the routing through the k8s ingress, but that's something I'm trying to avoid.
 Any suggestions?

 I am doing this in multiple parts because there are just so many things to cover and I like to be detailed in my guides. In the coming days, I will extend it to Traefik and Cloudflare. Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Link to imgur album of room
 I recently had a 4'x10' room added to my house. The room is accessible from inside the house and has an thru-wall fan exhausting into the garage. It doesn't have any dedicated cooling.
 I used double louvered doors with a 1/2" gap at the bottom, hoping this would allow air to be pulled in from the rest of the house.
 The fan on the back wall is a AC Infinity AIRFRAME T7-N exhausting into the garage.
 The rest of the house is usually kept around 70F. The server room stays around 80F in front of the rack and 90F behind the rack. At one point, I tried creating a hot/cold aisle with foam board, but I only noticed a 1-2 degree difference at best. 
 In the original design, I intended to put shelving on the walls of the server room and use it for bulk food storage/pantry, but I'd need the temperature to be closer to <70F for that. What could I do to lower the temperature of the room? I've considered cutting a hole in the wall for a window AC unit (exhausting into the garage), but I'd prefer to cool with airflow from the rest of the house if possible. Do I need a bigger exhaust fan?
 And finally, the rack contents (from bottom up) for anyone curious:
  
2x APC 3000s on dedicated circuits
 Custom build TrueNAS in Rosewill chassis
 Dell R210ii running pfSense
 Dell R620 unused
 2x Dell R630s running ESXi
 4U drawer
 2x Cisco 3750x switches
 Shelf

I'm thinking about doing two things in the near future.
  
I'd like to share files from my NAS with friends with the link coming from my domain
 I'd like to stand up a basic web service and expose it publicly over port 80/443 when someone visits my domain
  
I have some ideas on how to be safe about this, but would love all of your suggestions!
  
Connect internal and external services to my NPM container and use Access Lists to control which services are externally reachable (via IP range allowlisting). Point ports 80/443 to my NPM.
 
Spin up two NPM containers. One for internal services, one for external. Create a VLAN and put my external NPM + external services on that VLAN. Port forward 80/443 to my external NPM. Add firewall rules so traffic can't escape this VLAN. This might make sharing NAS files externally difficult (unless I put it on my external VLAN?).
 
For just sharing NAS files (ignoring website hosting) turn on Quickconnect and create a CNAME on my domain to map drive.mydomain.com -> quickconnect.mydomain.synology.me

 I scored a free 12 U server cabinet the other day, but it's looking a bit sad with the current setup. Right now there is a 6 year old HP laptop with Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-7200U CPU @ 2.50GHz and 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD. I only use this to run plex server with radarr, sonarr, qbt and Jackett.
 I want to expand with a rack-mounted server but I'm a bit overwhelmed with the options and price differences. I want something that can run ESXi with VMs for my plex media environment, as well as plenty of RAM and local storage options for NAS capability and practicing with virtual machines. 
 Low power consumption and noise are nice-to-haves, but right now I just want something to muck about with in my homelab, but with some solid functionality over the network. My budget is up to $400AUD, and I don't mind it being DDR3 as it's more affordable. 
 Can anyone point my in the right direction of brands/models/cpu configs I should be looking at for my needs?

 ​
 Just a quick question for today, so as of recently I have found myself with the need for some high clock speed cpu's in the datacenter lab for a project before i pull the trigger on some new hardware for my business, at the moment i am just using a couple of dell 7060SFF machines in the home lab but these will be too big ang bulky for the datacenter as i pay per ru, i stumbled across the r340 and the E-2288G in my testing on some rented dedicated servers but have been struggling to find the E-2288G for sale anywhere which made me think, its basically an I7 6700k, so can i use a 6700k in the R340 or a similar server ? 
 TLDR; will an i7 work in a dell server with the same socket ?

 I have just bought a OptiPlex 7040 Mini/Micro to replace my old ass laptop that handles my plex server (All storage is done on a 12TB 2 bay NAS).
 The relevant specs of the OptiPlex are i5-6500T, 8gb ram (I'm pretty sure ill double the ram just to be safe)
 What OS do you think I should run on my new setup? I'm currently running windows but think I should convert to Linux or maybe proxmox with a Linux boot for plex or maybe even Linux with docker for plex not sure yet, Tell me what you think.
 I'm also looking for any other suggestions for software to run. Have been thinking of hosting some game servers for a while now, Minecraft etc.
 I'm in my second year of computer science so I'm not afraid of a challenge

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering what the best way to edit video metadata is. My current method works just fine but it's SOOOOO slow and I'm looking for a better method. Currently I've got a bunch of .mp4 files with data written to the Title and/or Comment fields that I want to replace. I mostly just want to put my movie title in and nothing in the comments field. The name of the file is in Plex format "%Title% (%Year%)". I'd like to use the filename and strip out the year and just have the title. I also would like to do this in batches / automated.
 My current method is mp3tag and I use the auto tagging features to Remove Metadata, Replace Title with FileName, and then trim the year with RegEx matching. The main problem with this is that mp3tag rewrites the file when doing this. This means the file moves from my NAS to my computer and back to NAS. This is not an ideal solution. Any ideas? Thanks

 A little context:
 I'm looking for some object hosting (S3) and among several alternatives and recommendations on the internet, I saw someone commenting on the combination of Cloudflare R2 and OVH
 I don't understand a lot about it, I'm at the beginning of studies about it but after reading superficially, some ideas came to my mind
 OVH Object Storage does not charge for "outgoing internal traffic"
 I read on the internet that this is like sending from one server to another, different from, for example, providing a link or GET operation for that file externally/publicly
 Researching about Cloudflare R2, I understood that it does not charge for external/public output of objects and is compatible with S3
 I searched a bit on the internet and couldn't find the answer. 
 Direct question:
 Is it possible for me to use this OVH "outgoing internal traffic" (that is not charged) to send the files to another server like Cloudflare R2 and from R2 make it available in my application, so I don't need to pay OVH transfer fees?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title basically, I've made myself a NAS with just one 2TB hard drive in it, which seems pretty healthy but I really want to move to a system with at least 3 drives in RAID 5(?) so that one can die and I can rebuild when such occurs.
 I just want to know where I can find information about what I'm doing and what products exist and which ones are the best.
 Also as a random aside what do you guys use as offline storage? BD-Rs seem to be extremely expensive right now and I'd love a really cheap way to archive stuff like old youtube videos I love, DRM-Free games I have, and Minecraft saves.

I have no need to edit from this system, and if I would need something, I would just copy it to my local storage to work on. Most of the stuff I work on often doesn’t get touched again, but I would like to maintain its integrity in the event I may need to pull something for a client.

 I currently backup all my docket services in one Borg repo but I’ve been thinking of separating it into multiple ones. What are the pros and cons of each?
 My thinking is that some data is more important (e.g smb/Nextcloud/bitwarden) so I’d like go back it up more often and potentially push to google drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good evening and thanks for reading, 
 This is my first post here but I have been an occasional lurker for a while now and was wondering if anyone can steer me in the right direction to some resources or general information. I am looking to create a home media server that might be capable of some other things like ad blocking or running a VPN (I'm interested in exploring containerization later as well). With the equipment I have already where would I be best suited to look for instructions on how to go about accomplishing my goals and is there a better way of doing it? 
 Equipment thus far:
 - RaspberryPi 4B with 2GB in a starter kit (with power supply)[I wanted to try to make a Pi cluster]. https://www.pishop.ca/product/raspberry-pi-4b-starter-kit/
 - refurbished Lenovo ThinkCentre M73 Tiny Desktop (Intel G3250T 2.8GHz,128GB SSD, 8GB, WIFI)
 - Netgear 8-Port Gigabit Ethernet Smart Managed Plus Switch
 I also have 2 older (from 2009 & 2013) MacBook pros I have been slowly upgrading [batteries, memory, RAM where possible] in the hopes of using them to be my media servers but I am having issues sourcing some parts.
 I do have some experience with virtual machines (VM Ware) and Ubuntu/Linux) if that helps.
 Any information would be greatly appreciated, thanks again for reading.
 ​
 tl;dr: Point me (beginner) in the direction of information on how to build a home media server with the equipment I have or suggest some additional equipment.

 I am looking to start learning Kubernetes on my homelab and am looking to see if there are any good guides that people would recommend. I know there are a lot of them on the web but want to see if there are favorites among this community. 
 My goal with this is two get a 3-node cluster (2 workers, one control) up and running and then deploying a pod or two within the cluster. I know there are things like rancher and so forth, but before I dive deeper, I want to have the basics mastered.
 Thank you!

I've been meaning to make some upgrades to my desktop PC, and I'm currently struggling to find a very large internal drive, around 8-10 TB+, meant for standard/consumer desktops. Mostly everything I can find for a good deal right now is meant for NAS systems or enterprises, which have technologies that aren't recommended for a desktop, as compared to something like a Seagate Barracuda. Things like trade-off differences in speed and latency, error recovery, etc.
 I plan to store lots of large files, like lossless images and audio, movies, books, and maybe programs - all things I read and write regularly. My computer sees 15+ hours of use each day. I would also rather get one large drive than multiple smaller ones.
 One that I saw that seems like a great deal is the Toshiba X300 10TB CMR SATA 6 GB/s 7200 RPM 256 MB Cache - HDWR11AXZSTA for $189.99.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, i don't really know what to look for. I'm searching for a selfhosted mail client for teams, so that our support users can use the same mailboxes, something like outlook web or anything.
 Right now i use thunderbird and add the mailboxes to each user(4 users with 5 mailboxes).
 Are there any tools where i can add multiple mail accounts and add users which then i can give access to them?
 Would be nice if the programm runs on a shared hosting like 1and1 because i don't have access to a root server.
 For the features i only need adding users, give access to one or multiple mailboxes, add signature, rules/automations like in outlook/outlook web would be nice., don't need any fancy ticketing system(but wouldn't be bad either)

 FilterBridge: Apply filtering rules to a feed
 FeedReducerBridge: Reduce a feed by a percentage)
 XPathBridge: Parse any webpage using XPath expressions
  
Unfortunately, the Instagram and Facebook bridges are kinda broken due to aggressive anti-bot measures.

 I called an active reseller on eBay and got interesting information I though I might share this on this sub. Basically they gave me some context on how a drive becomes white labelled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit, this is a progress update post for Memories, a FOSS high performance alternative to Google Photos that you can host. Memories runs as a Nextcloud app, and has a batteries-included one-click installation procedure. You can access the repository here.
 For the title before the update (this is my dev instance with a lot of optimizations disabled; production is even faster). Something I just tried out for fun.
 40k photos in one view
 Progress update as of 11/22/2022
 tl;dr Memories became the first FOSS photo manager to have all basic features on this nice list.
 Some of the major new features:
 Live Photo Support
  
Thanks to a lot of research done by many people, Memories now has support for iOS, Google and Samsung live photos.
 HEIC is currently not supported for live photos since there are no good libraries to extract the motion photo part from HEIC.
  
Video Transcoding
  
Memories now supports live video transcoding with HLS adaptive streaming. Currently hardware acceleration is supported for Intel QuickSync.
 Thanks to a lot of fast feedback, most bugs in transcoding should also be fixed with v4.8.1
  
Multiple Timeline Folders
  
For maximum flexibility, you can now specify multiple folders to show in your timeline.
 You can also have timeline folders across storages now (e.g. external SSH storage)
  
Server side encryption
  
If you run standard Nextcloud encryption, things wont fail with an error anymore
  
New metadata sidebar
  
You can now see the location (with a map) and other metadata information in the sidebar
  
New photo viewer
  
With some fancy UX. Try it out ;)
  
The full changelog can be found here.
 If you use and enjoy Memories, please leave a star at GitHub. Thanks! 🎊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, everyone!
 So about a week ago I presented MonoBox here - a self-hosted music player I built 🎶
 And then a few days ago I published an article I wrote - a piece describing the entire process I went through, the difficulties I encountered, and how I learned everything from scratch to build MonoBox. All of this in order to help other people who are also learning programming and might be struggling 👨‍💻
 For a reason that is still unclear to me, the post was deleted. In the short time it was on the air, it received many upvotes, there were many sympathetic responses and it seems that the purpose for which I wrote the articles was achieved and helped many people. 😊
 I'm attaching the article once more in the hopes that more people will be able to read them and share their opinions, as it would be a shame for me if this opportunity were lost and those who didn't have time to read would miss it.
 And of course don't forget to star the repo! ⭐

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I found myself scrolling through Github’s “trending” repos. Within the next hour, I stumbled across something called The Sherlock Project. Interesting, It had over 35k stars, must be pretty popular.
 I quickly cloned the repo and started toying around with it. It didn’t take me long to realize the power of this tool. All I had to do was insert a username, and Wa Lah! I was looking at every social media website that was associated with the username. Not only that but direct links to the accounts.
 I started checking everyone's handles. This thing was freaky accurate. Not only that but it also spits out NSFW websites, which is outright hilarious. Welp, that was fun, time for bed.
 The next day I open my laptop and a realization strikes me, who the hell is gonna know how to use this outside of a nerd like me? I mean, you gotta open up a terminal, clone the repo, download all the dependencies… Not very user friendly.
 Well, what if I made this into a web app? I was off to the races. Just a week later, I had stripped the CLI tool apart and spun up a simple little react app. It was a little buggy at first, but it worked. You could now enter a username on the web and get back all the handles and their links. Sweet!
 Whats next? Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common questions I see in threads is "Where do you get those deals?" Well I get a lot of them in my job. I have a 300 square foot storage room filled with IT junk. I have about 40 Dell 7010 USSF pcs. I have a pile of about 20 Cisco poe switches next to me right now... I would LOVE to share, but r/homelabsales requires Paypal, which is a hard "No" for me. (And has been for a VERY long time.) I even tried to message the admins of homelabsales for options, and got no response. So, does anyone have any suggestions on how I can share some of my bounty, and get the wife to stop yelling at me about the amount of "crap" I have in the house? (Other than ebay... It is too much like a job, and I got one of those...)

 only other option is if there is a way to pull an OS off one nimble to install on another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So just to start I do not need a launcher that is not the problem I'm trying to solve, I've seen other people ask about this sort of thing in the past and it seems people tend to misinterpret "organizer" as launcher. The most important part is the organizing cataloguing is optional.
 I've been looking around and haven't been able to find anything that ticks the boxes I'm looking for. About the closest I've gotten is Gameyfin which while great is definitely lacking some core features I'd be looking for.
 Essentially what I would want is an application that can be accessed through a browser though honestly I'd even take a piece of desktop software, that I can point at my game backups like my local GOG installers for example, that could then pull metadata, and organize the files based on those tags preferably with a customizable naming scheme. Then host a page that would allow browsing and downloading or even opening the folder in explorer where it is on my local network. Don't really care for any automatic downloading features just used Sonarr/Radarr for an example of the great organization capabilities.
 At this point I've already started working on building something along these lines myself though if someone has already made something like this it'd be great to not have to reinvent the wheel, anyone have any suggestions on something that could tick these boxes?

 I want to download all the pdfs from this website (https://www.supersummary.com/all-study-guides/) that will be available to me as soon as I pay for my monthly subscription.
 EDIT: 
 I want to access each of those books on the following 500+ pages
 ​
 After accessing the book the download pdf shall be executed and the pdf stored
 Edit over
 I tried HTtracker but it does not seem to work for me. Is it the right tool and I am just not using it properly? I have the feeling that it is not opening all the guides and does not try to download the pdfs but instead just downloads every link it can find without going into every link and checking again.
 ​
 Do you think Wget will get the job done? If so, how would I have to use it?
 ​
 Thanks in advance and sorry for my english.

 I'm relatively new to containers and I'm wondering if making a backup of the mounted volumes, plus sql-dumps of the mariaDB schemas, would be sufficient?
 After all the docker image itself can be re-fetched in case of disaster?
 How do you deal with docker-compose labels and such? 
 Am I missing something?

 and I say that, because transcend to my surprise said that 220S (MTE220S) is losing warranty if it poweredon constantly.
 The NVMes (3 of them, in 3 computers) started having issues accessing data! and lost data in all. Because they all died in 1 month of constant 24x7 power on.
 The total TBW was 1TB out of 2.2PB 
 I am surprised with all this. and I want to use 3 NVMes. I expect 200TBW in 5 years so that is not a prob.
 I want not to lose my warranty because they are just powered on! 
 ​
 They will be installed on 3 NUCs
 I can give more info on Transcend's replies! never had this before in my life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I played a lot with multiple automation tools in the last two weeks. I was focused on finding open-source and free solutions.
 Here are 5 open-source/free automation tools that you can use right away. Two of these are ready-to-use Zapier alternatives.
 👉 I vote for #3 and #5.
  
Huginn - Huginn is a system for building agents that perform automated tasks for you. It’s like creating your own personal assistant, but without the need to learn a programming language.
  
Hosting: Self-hosted.
  
automatisch - It is an automation tool that lets you easily create workflows in your web browser with no coding knowledge required. It's a user-friendly Zapier alternative.
  
Hosting: Self-hosted (for now).
  
n8n - N8n is an open-source, no-code automation tool that lets you quickly create workflows with its drag-and-drop interface. It is based on nodes so you can connect anything to everything. The best Zapier alternative I've seen.
  
Hosting: Desktop, hosted, & self-hosted.
  
Beehive - This is similar to how Huginn works. It's an event and agent system. Agents are triggered by events and perform their actions. There are multiple integrations (called Hives).
  
Hosting: Self-hosted.
  
Power Automate - Microsoft's official no-code automation tool. It allows you to create flows for automating your tasks. It also has a desktop version (included in Windows 11). You can automate almost anything with it.
  
Hosting: Desktop and hosted (cloud flows - not free).
 ---
 I have created some flows to automate Google Chrome using Power Automate and it works really nicely. I am also using the n8n desktop version for connecting multiple services that I use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what I'm asking is alot but I feel like what I'm asking should be a very common request for anyone doing basic YouTube archiving of descriptions and comments.
 I'm looking for something like:
 Root folder having the yt-dlp exe then in same directory folders created with the YouTube channel name
 YouTube channel name > Folder with name as the video title > mp4, description as txt, comments
 Repeat folder generation for each video on the YouTube channel
 Edit: It seems this post is getting alot of attention from people wanting to do exactly this. After a couple hours I figured it out:
 yt-dlp --get-comments --print-to-file "%(comments)#j" "%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s 
 From my understanding this will do everything you need along with populating a json file that contains info like keywords on the video, upload date etc. You can open it in Firefox. If you only want the video, description and comments itself then you can add --no-write-info-json to the command. Thus it would be:
 yt-dlp --no-write-info-json --get-comments --print-to-file "%(comments)#j" "%(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.comments.json" --write-description URL HERE -o %(channel)s/%(title)s/%(title)s.%(ext)s

 There he is!
 I had forgotten about this site: https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/peer/ , but if you didn't know about it, it shows what torrent files were observed from a specific IP address. The link displays your IP by default, and could show if your firewall rules need a closer look because 'someone' on your LAN needed an ISO... but you can browse and see what your "IP neighbors" were up to, which is entertaining :)

 I just purchased a use Optiplex to replace the laptop I had some services on. In the past, I've installed software by hand, but this time wanted to focus on Docker.
 I followed the tutorial by highspeed_usaf and got SWAG and Cloudflare's tunnel working. I added NextCloud, Portainer, SearxNG, and Doku. Everything is working fine and SSL is working too even though, I'm not sure I really set it up (using SSL via CloudFlare).
 Anyway, NextCloud's security check is giving me a lot of warnings. Before, when I installed NC by hand, I was able to get rid of all the warnings and such. However, because I'm running NC via Docker, I'm not quite sure what to do. 
 I'm pretty new to Docker, so I'm still not sure what the process is when I get such errors. Do I change files within the container itself? Or is there a better way to do this?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I ordered a SuperChassis 505-203B and an X10SDV-4C-TLN2F motherboard.
 On Supermicro's site for the motherboard, it lists the compatible chassis as:
 505-203B and 504-203B.
 Funny enough, both of these "supported" chassis only have a 20-pin power connector.
 Can I safely use the 20-pin in the 24-pin header?
 I was doing some brief research and it looks like those pins are only for "extra protection," but I don't want to risk anything burning, shorting out, etc.
 Supermicro support told me that the 20-pin connector has the necessary pins and should work no problem, but I just want to be as safe as possible.
 ​
 Here are the specs for the PSU:
 1U 200W Multi-output power supply Gold level w/20pin Power Efficiency 91% Total Output Power and Input 200W with Input 100 - 240Vac AC Input Frequency 50-60Hz Dimensions (L x W x H) 192 x 76 x 40.3 mm Output Type 20pin ATX -12V Max: 0.5A / Min: 0A +12V Max: 16A / Min: 0.1A (100Vac - 240Vac) +5V Max: 8A / Min: 0.1A +3.3V Max: 8A / Min: 0.1A +5Vsb Max: 2A / Min: 0A Certification: 80 Plus Gold Certified Power Supply Safety / EMC BSMI CCC CE/EMC FCC class B TUV/CB UL/CUL 
 Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

 I have configured Grafana and Prometheus. They are pretty pog for long term stats and visualisation. But I just can't find a quick and easy way to configure Grafana so that it sends me a daily report of some metrics. I saw there is an enterprise feature similar to that.
 So, my question is, what do you guys do? Is there any quick and dirty way to set up daily reporting of metrics? Are there any containers that can do those for me? For now, I would prefer the process to be as hands off as possible. Please leave me your suggestions.

From searching on here, many recommend the PhotoSync app but I'm wondering if having 2 iphones syncing to the same computer hard drive will overwrite some of the files since I believe the file names by default on iPhones are IMG_xxxx and that prefix or the naming convention can't be changed (or can it?)
 We don't take much videos but good amount of pictures as we go on short trips every weekend. And we would like to have all of them stored not on some cloud.
 Just looking for a simple way to back-up photos that we take. Any suggestions are welcome!

Has it been mitigated if you're running the latest version of Linux for example? 
 What about hyperthreading/SMT? It feels like yesterday where everyone was freaking out that hyperthreading got busted wide open and the only way to be safe is to completely disable it (particularly on Intel CPUs). Gas that been mitigated or is it still a bad idea to run hyperthreading on older CPUs?
 It feels like everyone was freaking out that the sky was falling after Spectre and Meltdown was discovered, how we've been plunged back into the age where just loading the wrong webpage can get your online banking info stolen, and then abruptly stopped talking about it a few months later. So what's the state of older processors today?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys... 
 Anyone here run a drivepool + snapRAID?
 I've been running stablebit drivepool on my NAS for almost a decade now. Great piece of windows software. I'm only now thinking about putting some parity system in place to prevent bitrot so I think snapRAID seems to be one possible solution.
 Here are my questions:
  
I'm trying to understand how it works and how much storage it needs. Will it basically require a 1:1 storage footprint of the files it's monitoring? so if I have 2 TB of data spread across my drivepool, I'll need at least 2 TB drive for my parity drive?
 
Also, should I be configuring snapRAID to monitor the files on my drivepool mount or should it be configured to point to the raw files on the individual drives? I'm confused because stablebit drivepool has it's own duplication/redundancy feature so I'm not sure how snapRAID will handle that.
 
lastely, should I be considering a different solution than snapRAID?
 
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So Saturday there was a early Black Friday deal on Amazon for 16TB WD MyBooks.
 Since I had good experience with them in the past, I bought 3 to shuck them.
 ​
 They arrived today and I happily connected them to seemingly hear the tones of death.
 The sounds are very strong after spin up.
 During sequential write there is no sound but during rand read write it sounds like the heads are scraping the disks very lightly.
 ​
 I will do a full write/read test to see how they do but since all 3 of them make the same sounds I wonder if they are actually dead.
 ​
 Technical Data: 
 Smart reports them as WD160EDGZ-11B2DA0 which with a bit of google magic are white label Ultrastar DC HC550 7200RPM 512MB Cache 16TB SATA Datacenter Drives
 ​
 Tests via USB
 FIO SEQ WRITE [w=183MiB/s][w=183 IOPS]
 FIO RAND READ WRITE [r=87.0MiB/s,w=15.0MiB/s][r=87,w=15 IOPS]
 All 3 make the same sounds. 
 ​
 Sounds:
 Took me over a hour to convert it, so reddit accepts it and I don't get any sound...
 In case it does not work I uploaded the sounds here: https://filetransfer.io/data-package/1ncFUb2A#link ( 779KB )

That being said, has anyone had any luck fabricating a rackmount chassis with hand-operated tools? Sure, anyone can weld a box with holes, but I wanted to make sure there aren’t any tight tolerances anywhere that require computer-guided precision. (I might 3D-print the front panel, though.) Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked up free three servers from my old college’s e-waste bin. It appears they were custom built from Canadian company for audio production.
 All of them are using iStarUSA D-300 3U rackmount chassis with C2D setup with some special audio capture and ASUS GeForce 8400 GS Fanless cards. I decided remove all existing hardware components in the servers because their motherboard and PSU are dead due to leaked capacitors. I gave away one of them to my friend.
 Then, I installed two servers chassis with old and. new hardwares I have:
  
 Chinese X99 board with Xeon E5-2640 v3, 32GB DDR4 ECC REG, and 12TB (4x3TB SAS HDD) RAID setup. It is currently running Unraid.
  Supermicro X79 dual socket board with two Xeon E5-2620 v2, 64GB DRR3 ECC REG, and 500GB SSD SATA. It is currently running Proxmox.
  
Now, I have many important questions about how to mount large and heavy 3U server on rack. I am planning to buy used/new rack end of 2022 but my server chassis do not came with slide rail. They do have ears and handle where I can put screw but I am worrying about that stuffs are heavy while installing on the rack. iStarUSA don’t sell slide rail (I am in Canada). Is it supposed to mount it with ears instead of slide rail?
 P.S. This is my first rack servers. I was using tower servers for long time.
 P.S.S For information about that chassis: http://www.istarusa.com/en/istarusa/products.php?model=D-300 (same name and number model but mine has front USB 2.0 ports. I will post photo of setup in comment this tonight.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m totally stumped by this one. I figure if anywhere has experience with this kind of thing, it’s probably this sub. The drive is formatted as ExFAT if that helps. 
 So I accidentally pulled the USB connector out without properly ejecting first (this was on Mac OS X). Upon plugging it back in, it sees that there’s a drive, but is unable to mount it. Disk Utility has a first aid feature that’s supposed to be able to fix filesystem errors, but it doesn’t even try, just immediately throws an error code (-69845). 
 Now, this has happened before, and previously Windows was able to repair it. Not this time, though. Plugging it in on Windows I get a “USB device not recognized” error. It can’t even tell that it’s a hard drive. It just shows up as “unknown device”. 
 So at this point I’m panicking. But I have a laptop that runs Fedora Linux, so I try plugging it in… and it works! No problem whatsoever reading and writing. So that’s great, but I mainly use it on Windows/OSX, so them not being able to recognize it is kind of a problem. Fedora also has a disk repair feature, but upon running it, it just says the drive is fine and there’s nothing to repair. So I try again on OSX and Windows hoping it had solved itself, but again, neither can recognize it. 
 What on earth is going on here? Why can only Linux read it, and is there a way of fixing this without having to backup, reformat, and reload the backup? Because currently it’s my biggest hard drive, other than this I only have a few 1TB portable drives. Besides, clearly it’s not that badly corrupted if Linux can read it, so that feels like a bit of a waste of time 
 Any help would be appreciated.

 Anyone know of any easy self hosted alternative? At one point I was using flexget but it’s not made for this so setting it up was convoluted and hard to maintain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I used to run a simple windows server while exposing my services using port forwarding and mostly neglecting security. Now I setup a Proxmox server and after doing some research in this subreddit, decided to put some effort in securing my server and services. I found a lot of useful resources on here so thanks everyone for sharing.
 I'am now looking for the next steps to take to increase security. I'am also trying to find out how much security is enough (for me).
 I have the following setup:
  
Cloudflare with SSL/TLS set to Full connecting my domain (and subdomains) to my IP. Blocking access from other countries then the one I'am receding in.
 
Nginx Proxy Manager with port 80 and 443 open to the public. In this I added a Let's Encrypt certificate and forcing SSL. It also contains an access list allowing only the Cloudflare IP range.
 
OpenVPN client with its port open to the public in it's own LXC.
 
 I currently (temporary) have no services open to the public in Nginx Proxy Manager (temporary set them to local network only). I'd like to make Jellyfin (hosted in it's own LXC) available to the public but like to tighten up security a bit before I do so. I expect to lack security in my internal network. But don't know where to start, I'am not running a router currently and using the default Proxmox network settings and my router as DHCP server.
 Where should I go from here? I'd also like to know which kind of security measures I need to setup in regard to the OpenVPN client.
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: I'd like to enable access to Jellyfin without the us of a VPN.

 I cant seem to find any info if what I'm trying to do is possible.
 I want to run a matrix server without the session verification feature, only on an internal network, perhaps with a federation to one other trusted server. Even the encryption feature is not neccesary.
 The users are frequently going to login on different devices and I all this verification fuss is driving me mad. 
 Is there any way to achieve this??

 I tried to tar, scp and zip the files but the special characters are not handled correctly. My Google-Fu pointed me to some solutions to change the files to ASCII naming - however as these are referenced within the db this could cause issues.
 What is the correct way of moving files with UTF from one host to another?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've recently aquired a FiiO M11 player, which is pretty nice.
 So I got to thinking about music syching.
 Currently I've explored the following options:
 MusicBee on my Windows laptop with the MusicBee Android companion for WiFi sync. Works quite well, but requires my Windows laptop to be up.
 Resilio Sync, pointed to a folder on my network storage, with the app on the Android side pointed to a folder on the external SD card. Can sync files by dropping them into the storage on the network and remove from player by removing them from the folder on the storage. Would prefer to be using Syncthing, but that's unable to write to an external SD card.
 I have a Plexpass and Plexamp works well. However, as I quite like the default player on the Fiio, I'd like to use that too (Plexamp downloads are not in a format readable by other apps)
 What I'd really like would be able to browse a list of artists/albums/track from the player and select them to sync down.
 Are there any options anyone's aware of that I've not yet explored? Can Subsonic clients download in a format readable by other apps for example?
 Curious as to what others may be using.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody,
 ​
 So, request from my miss: a shared grocery list AND a shared calendar. On the same app. Go find it.
 ​
 Now, let me further explain that: as you may have understood may lovely half would like an Android app (if possible, but further on this later) which hosts both a shared grocery / to-do list along a shared calendar.
 ​
 I've already found a pre-existing app (Cozi Family on the playstore) which does exactly this, but I'd prefer a self-hosted solution because... reasons (and to justify the expense to upgrade the current homelab I'm running :D )
 Jokes aside, I'm already aware of multiple selfhosted solutions (Grocy, our-shopping-list, Nextcloud, etc.) but to my knowledge those are doing a single thing each (maybe it could be done with nextcloud, but for this scope is a bit overkill) but I'm looking for a single solution, and as mentioned, it should have an Android app (possibly) but it's not mandatory, if it's a webapp I could work with that.
 ​
 Any chance something similar already exists?
 ​
 Thanks!
 ​
 EDIT: after posting, I've taken a further look and found a multitude of similar apps, but they have the same """problem""": they aren't selfhosted.
 So if possible, keep this as a suggestion for selfhosted solutions and not altervatives.

 I am trying to get a bearing on how much resources I'll need to host it, I am anticipating approx 800 users, maximum maybe 300 will try to access it simultaneously, so how much ram, CPU and storage area would anyone recommend? How many users do you have and how much resources do you use? And is it comfortable or would you increase it? Should I go for shared hosting, will it be enough, or is it necessary to get a VPS?
 TLDR: for 800 users, 300 access simultaneously, how much ram, storage space and CPU cores do I need? Should I go for shared hosting (Namecheap) or is it necessary to get a VPS?
 Thank you everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody, I see alot of people using Tailscale here as you should as it's an efficient tool for cross-device acces. However I also see some people be a little bit bummed out by the lack of devices on the free plan. Well fear not as tailscale has a plan which is made for open-source projects to use, and also for friend/family use. The Github Community Plan.
 This plan is a free to use plan for open-source projects and for friends/family use and can easily be accessed by the steps below. It gives 125 devices(In total, not like 5 devices per user), up to 25 users, and 1 subnet router. 
 Step 1: Create a github account
 Step 2: Create a github organization(https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch)
 Step 3: Login to tailscale with the account which registered the Github Organization.
 Step 4: When logged in, select the org when presented with "Select Network" as it should be under the "Multi-user tailnet" banner.
 Step 5: Go to Settings > billing > Update Plan and go ahead and select the "Github Community Plan".
 Step 6: Now your done, now you have the above limitations for your account at no extra cost. 
 Hope this helps some people and have fun selfhosting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hi, i've been self-hosting stuff for a couple years now (freshrss, radarr, etc.) and have never had any reason to use port-forwarding, ddns, or tunneling to make my services available outside of my local network. for this reason, i skip authentication where i can, but i'm not a networking person, so sometimes i wonder if my setup is vulnerable. i'm not sure exaclty how uPnP works or if I should add firewall rules. 
 basically, if i never touch port forwarding, is there any reason my services would be exposed to the open internet? apart from using open port checkers on my own IP, how can i check for vulnerabilities? thanks! love this community btw.

I'm running Ubuntu server 22.04 and ZFS with 4 seagate EXOS 16TB HDDs in raidz1 + a 256GB NVME cache drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm a not experienced user and this would be my first build. So if you don't mind I have a couple of probably simple questions.
 My goal: to run a couple of simple dockers application and then the occasional Plex/Jellyfish and file storage.
 I'd like to have something that uses around 15 watts per hour, anyway the consumption can be a little bit more.
 In terms of memory I'd like to connect: 1 SSD and two 18 TB 3.5 hard drives.
 I found a pc with those specs:
 -Itx Intel J1900 2,00 Ghz Quad Core -ASRock Q1900B-ITX - 16 GB ram 
 I went on the Asrock website and it says that the motherboard has:
  
1 x PCI Express 2.0 x1 Slot
 2 x SATA2 3.0 Gb/s Connectors, support NCQ, AHCI and Hot Plug
  
Now questions are: - Can I use the pci express slot to add more SATA ports? - Would the 2X 3.0 Gb ports allow me to connect 3.5 hard drives? - it is enough speed to satisfy my needs?
 Pardon me if the questions are too simple or obvious, and thanks in advance!

 I currently have firefox set up to search with my SearXNG instance. Let's say my server goes down. Then I can no longer search through the URL bar. I instead have to go to searx.org or something and type my query there.
 I would need a browser extension that periodically pings my services to check if they're up, and if they're not, automatically set up a redirect so that when I go to their URL, I get sent somewhere else instead.
 Does something like this exist?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am curious about the potential of cloud hosting. I had a server running hosting Siacoin with 29tb of redundant HDD via Raidz-1. However, the returns were next to nothing so I looked into other solutions and I found nextcloud. Through that I have a few options and was wondering what the community believes would be the best course of action.
  
Rent out storage on a central server and offer that to users via WHMCS and Nextcloud module.
 Offer users their own nextcloud server through VPS and use wireguard tunneling/reverse proxys to provide each VPS its own ip/domain and use an automated script to download and setup nextcloud.
  
Which option do you think I should choose? Currently I am leaning to option one because it would be simpler and continues with my business plan to expand into my own software, create mirrored servers for redundancy etc...
 Edit: I am also worried about potential liability concerns regarding data loss. What can I do to negate liability in a document form. 
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm very pleased with cloudflare tunnels, it feels much less scary to publish each of my services at servicename.domain.ext because:
  
I don't have to port-forward
 I don't have to have something watching my dynamic IP address
 Most importantly, I can set security rules, like limiting access to my country, and more
  
It's against the ToS to use these for media streaming (on the free plan). I'd like to stay free but also serve media, without drastically reducing my security. You guys can tell me if this is unreasonable 😄
 What's the next logical step?
 All my services have their own username/password, some have 2FA, but I'm interested in OAuth. Does it make sense to use a cloudflare tunnel for the authentication of say, a Jellyfin server, but once logged in, just use a direct connection? How would one go about that? Looking into Caddy 2/Traefik but I'm not sure if I'm overlooking any big flaws.
 Or, if I want some services (say, Tandoor recipes) to be under Cloudflare's protection, but others (Jellyfin) using a 'direct' connection, is it possible to achieve both of those on the same domain name (under different subdomain)?

I haven't done something like this and am confused where to start but I like the idea of self hosting and avoiding as many monthly fees as possible. Is it a good idea to have the database on the company laptop, and pay for the site to be hosted? Are there any security concerns with that? Are there security concerns with also hosting the web server on the laptop if only 2 or 3 people will be using it? Or do I have to worry about random bots or trolls connecting to the address.
 I'd be happy with suggestions to a good starting point too

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am trying to build my server infrastructure completely with WSL2 and Docker-Compose. It should contain networking, backups, various services (Nextcloud, Gitea, postgresql...) and those services will be accessed from LAN only. Some services can have internet access for making requests into internet (Node-RED for example).
 I see there could be issues, especially with backups and disks. I am thinking to host a Kopia container which i use to backup data to another drive. Another question i have is related to disk health, S.M.A.R.T monitoring - Is there any solution for getting information about disks with WSL2? I see Scrutiny as an ideal solution but I think it's not for WSL2.
 I'd like to hear experiences about WSL2 if it has been successful solution, what are caveats, is virtual machine better etc.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Long time lurker here! Hoping to get some advice with a situation I’ve put myself in. 
 I have 2 hosts: A T320 running esxi 6.7 and an r720 with proxmox. 
 The r720 is new to me and has nothing on it. The t320 has been my one and only server up until now. A very welcome upgrade. 
 My thought process for migration since the r720 has a lot more power is to move my physical disks from the 320 to the 720. 
 After that, I will add new drives to the t320 and use that as a secondary host. 
 I have reviewed the wiki and a lot of documentation about migration but I can’t seem to see any prerequisites about physically moving the disks. 
 Would I just move the disks, import the foreign raid configuration, then convert the vmdk’s to qcow2?
 Considering esxi and proxmox are very different operating systems I can assume the folder structure is not the same and may prove to be a bad idea. 
 If it boils down to me just needing to buy new drives and save the headache, I’m fine with that. 
 My main goal was to see if anyone else here had similar experience with this situation and to get any recommendations. 
 Thanks!

The prices for both are almost the same, with Crucial costing just 15€ more currently. I know that MX500 uses TLC and thus has better write speeds. But since the drive is going to mostly be used for storage, the main thing I care about is the longevity. So which one do you think would last more as a storage device?

Just a tool that notifies me (e.g. using a WebHook, Telegram, ..) if a disk/mountpoint is almost full. It would be nice if it's possible to also get a notification if a systemd service fails or define custom shell commands but that's not as important. Prometheus and all these databases seem like overkill. It should be as lightweight as possible (RAM usage, disk usage, dependencies).
 If such a thing does not exist yet, let me know if you'd be interested. I might create such a tool if no one comes up with something. If you think such a tool doesn't make sense without time-series data (and graphs) let me know why you think so please.
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I've been using Unraid for years now. I have a lot of docker containers and NPM set up and running with a cloudflare tunnel and my own domain. I come across a lot of programs that I'd like to try out on a 2nd server so I don't mess anything up on my primary server. I don't want mass texts about plex being down. So I just spun up a 2nd server running proxmox and an ubuntu server vm. I installed docker, docker compose, and I'd like to kind of mirror my original unraid setup and get everything proxied through NPM, but I'm having a hard time getting it set up with the same domain. 
 When I try to go through the cloudflare tunnel setup it says I already have mydomain.net with a DNS record. Is it possible to have 2 instances of NPM on 2 different machines using the same domain and cloudflare tunnels or do I need to get a 2nd domain? I'm not sure how to describe this situation to search for a guide for it. Any help would be appreciated.

 Does anybody think I'd have issues running a cheap, used micro PC (like a Dell 7050 or similar) with probably Ubuntu server to host this minimal web server? Not sure if the dashboard would require docker, but I assume since docker can run on a pi it could run on something more. 
 I'm not looking to host a file serverz or Plex, or anything else other than this web interface. Potentially if the docker turns out easy, I might migrate my piHole and diyhue from their respective pis, but not sure on that one yet.

Although my server is only accessible via LAN, I want certain services behind a VPN to hide my public IP. 
 WireGuard works when everything is in a single compose file by adding the following for each service: 
 network_mode: service:wireguard depends_on: - wireguard 
 However, when services are in different compose files, they can no longer see WireGuard and show this error: 
 ERROR: Service 'mediatracker' uses the network stack of service 'wireguard' which is undefined. 
 I also have the different compose files connected to the same Docker network:

I currently have a Seagate external hard drive that requires me to plug my iPhone into my Windows PC in order to back up, and the process does not work well and takes a very long time. Is there a better solution where I can back up my iPhone wirelessly or automatically to an external hard drive? What hard drive would you recommend to do this? I already have a Cloud storage solution and am looking for a physical hard drive. Sorry if this is a basic question, but I haven’t found an easy solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been scouring the internet and racking my head to solve this for a few hours and finallyd decided to post this.
 My current setup is a RPi 4 running 64 bit Ubuntu with docker running pihole and freshrss. I can access the web interfaces for these two services on my WiFi network on any device currently. 
 My end goal is to be able to access these services over the internet (without having to be on the same network) on my custom domain, which is registered on Njalla.
 Currently from all my internet troubleshooting what I've gathered is I need to add DNS records to my Njalla domain, do port forwarding on my router and run an nginx reverse proxy?
 What I can't seem to find is a good guide to do this. I went into my router settings and did the port forwarding from ports 80-10000 for a test for both TCP/UDP mapped to the RPi, but when I check online using port checkers, it is still closed. How do I verify these things are working? And how do I configure nginx here?
 Any guides or explanations would be super appreciated! Absolutely lost here.

 Dell PowerEdge T430 Motherboard
 I plan on using the eight 3.5" bays for storage pools, one SATA port will connect to the OS SSD (ProxMox, TrueNAS & pfSense) and the other SATA port will connect to the VM SSD.
 If I purchased this box, do I need an HBA card? Or could I simply get two SFF-8643 to SFF-8087 cables to connect the backplane directly to the board and disable the onboard raid controller? 
 Or, is there something I'm not taking into consideration here?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've been self-hosting for a while, but for the first time, setting up an always-on server.
 Many previous posts on this sub have suggested Proxmox for a first server. However, based on my requirements, I was leaning towards Truenas Scale Bluefin. I need it to host some reliable storage for Postgres and fileshares, provision VMs to throw at my (external) K3s cluster for burstability, and lastly, host dev VMs for builds and VNC. I dont need vm snapshots, or hardware passthrough.
 The other thing is I also want to learn for career development, and TrueNAS familiarity seems to be a more useful skill since Proxmox isn't used in enterprise at all- looks even less likely as K8s seems to be the future of enterprise.
 Wondering with these requirements, does TrueNAS Scale over Proxmox make sense?

 I always silently assumed people are talking about (legal or illegal) file sharing and a digital collection for "personal" use. Probably in most countries heavily biased to the illegal side. 
 Not here to judge, so that's maybe a stupid question: What else would be a common consumer use case for which hardware decoding on a NAS is required?

The inside server temp are around 35-41C and I’m afraid that if that room goes any cooler condensation will occur and break part. So my question should I find other solution to heat up that room or move completely out of there (I was told if there a constant air flow this will not occur wonder what people opinion are on this) current plan is trying to warm up the room
 Edit: I have two sever and all my networking gear all in the same place as the dell sever stack one on top of the other with spacer in between and networking gear wall mounted
 Closed: I was not aware to the fact the the computer would need to be lower them temp room for condensation to occur

 Im working on building an offline home surveillance system. Haven't settled on an OS or software situation yet, so Im purely asking about hardware. 
 I cobbled together a server out of spare parts. Its an i7-4770s, H97 mobo, 32GB ram, gtx 750ti, 20TB storage (for redundancy). 
 Do you think these parts would work for a 4-8 camera system? Id love to keep it mega cheap so if I can rock these parts for a while thatd be great.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on increasing security in my lab. I currently have 3 VLANS setup:
  
Management - Admin interfaces for NAS, Hypervisor, Firewall, Switches, etc
 Home - My personal devices
 Servers - All my application/docker VMs / Services
  
My firewall rules are setup in a way such that Management/Home devices can reach out to Servers, but Servers cannot reach out to Management/Home devices. I run NGINX on its own VM which is currently grouped in with the Server VLAN. I was considering moving my NGINX VM from the Server VLAN to it's own VLAN (DMZ I think people call it?).
 I wasn't sure if this is worth it or not.. Even if NGINX gets its own VLAN, I'll still have to poke holes through my firewall rules to allow communication to all my services anyway. I would guess that if the proxy gets compromised, being in its own VLAN would help control lateral movement by not having access to SSH on my application servers, or access to network shares for example, and only having access to application ports.
 This of course comes at the cost of my sanity having to put in a new firewall rule every time I add a new application to allow proxy communication, as well as putting (a lot?) of extra strain on my firewall.
 Are there any other major security improvements that this implementation can have that I'm missing, that would maybe make it worth doing?
 ​
 Edit: Another question I forgot to type. HTTPS terminates at the proxy. The proxy talks to most, if not all, back-end applications over plain HTTP. Most apps talk to each other with HTTP as well. I would assume that NGINX getting its own VLAN helps to prevent it from seeing Application <-> Application communication in the Server VLAN. But If the proxy is compromised and communicates with the Application servers over HTTP anyway, is there any protection being offered by being in a different VLAN? No right?

 The summary says to consider replacing both disks. This is weird to me, how is it possible that both completely new drives (bought from Amazon) are failing?
 Is this normal for drives to come with some amount of bad sectors or should I immediately return them?

allow for uploading of diverse file types, including video and audio;
 support categories and tags;
 support full-text search, or at least search by tags;
 have a user management system (rights/groups/etc.);
 support a review process for new files/materials;
 either have a sleek GUI or integrate with a popular CMS like Joomla;
 [optional] ideally, give users the ability to provide feedback on individual materials;
 [optional] ideally, have a free/community version (open source greatly preferred).
  
Great thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but here goes.
 A bit context: I have (had) an Acer Nitro Laptop, which has a 1 TB HDD, to which I added a 256 GB SSD for OS. I partitioned the 1 TB HDD into 2 500 GB ext4 partitions (I was using Linux), 1 for documents (we'll call that doc partition) and all other data, and one for daily system backup(we'll call that backup partition) which also had a backup of the doc partition. Everything was going smooth.
 A few days ago, I got a new MacBook Pro, and I thought I could just take the HDD out of the laptop, put it in a case, and I am basically good to go. Here starts the tale.
 The problem: ext4 can only be used natively by Linux, which means I have to format the HDD to NTFS without losing either the data or the backup. My brilliant mind came up with the idea to copy the data of one partition to another, format the first one with NTFS, move the whole 2nd partition to the formatted first one, format the second and we are done.
 Here's where I f*cked up. Instead of moving the data from data partition to the it's corresponding folder in backup partition, I overwrote the backup partition with the data one (which was bad as I had documents outside of data partition in the system, which should be in the daily system backup). And after I formatted the first partition, I moved the data from backup partition to the first, and promptly formatted the second one to NTFS.
 Now I needed some data that was not in the data partition, I realised my boo boo. 
 And now, I am running a full deep recovery on the disk, which might take hours and I may or may not get back my data.
 PS: I have another external NTFS HDD which I should've used for this exercise, but that's neither here nor there.

 The system runs off an M.2 drive so we don't have to worry about that, but it's only got 4 SATA ports leaving me too short. The PCI-E 16x slot is unpopulated and I have no plans to put ever put a graphics in there, it's running terminal-only.
 Seems like I've got a few options:
  
Buy one of those super cheap PCI-E SATA cards.
 Buy a second hand SAS card (I know almost nothing about them, seems overkill for 2 drives?)
 SATA -> USB adapters? (plz no, but also theres enough unused USB headers on the motherboard to do this if it's actually not a bad idea)
  
Thoughts?

 From top to bottom:
 -2x cat6 patch panels to keep things "tidy" in the front
 -1x USW48 Pro for all my 1Gb switching needs
 -1x Mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ for iSCSI + backups
 -1x old Supermicro 1U server I got used with a Xeon E3-1220 V2 and 32Gb of ram that runs my opensense box (I really don't like virtualized firewalls, too risky)
 -1x QNAP TS453-BU NAS with 2 Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 2x IronWolf 8TB for backups
 -1x QNAP TS1886-XU NAS with 4x Intel DC SSDs for my VMs over iSCSI + 4x Exos 18TB for storage
 -2x Dell R630 I got for free at work running a proxmox Cluster with plenty of power for all my virtual machines
 -1x Proxmox server for some Flux nodes
 -1x Truenas box as a 3rd backup target with 28TB of storage + 4 IBM SAS SSDs over iSCSI for my VMs
 -1x unused server
 -1x little APC UPS
 About 700W of power usage. Yes I like to have several iSCSI targets for virtual machines so I can move them around whenever the underlying server needs to get updated. That Mikrotik switch has been a great 10Gb switch for the price.
 I run a whole bunch of services on there, from basic storage, to active directory, exchange, the usual sonarr, radarr, prowlarr stack, paperless, netboot.xyz, some homebrew websites like a lego set inventory and investment tracker, openhab, docker, plex, gameyfin etc....
 It's located where our old heating fuel tank used to be. I pretty happy with the state of my lab for the moment tho I really need to take time (I don't have) to do some real nice cable management.
 The next major project is going to be to redo the room itself with a raised floor, drywall on all wall and ceiling etc. cause it's really just barebone and ugleh!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I have a TrueNAS server running with a RAID-Z3 configuration and recently upgraded my entire server HDDs. Now I plan to sell the old used drives but before that I want to erase them securely. 
 This brings me to my question - what is the best tool to securely erase all my drives? Is a single format of my drives (for example Windows quick format) enough to format my disks since they were in a RAID or is it safer to use a tool explicitly designed for that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got a new computer and I plan on using the old one as a NAS server. I currently have a 4 TB and an new 8 TB ironwolf drive, which as far as i understand can't put them in a raid (i mean i can do raid 0 which would give me 4TB usable). 
 Is it a better idea to return the 8 TB drive and buy 3 4TB to run TrueNAS with 4x4TB drives?
 I have an mATX MB which has 4 sata slots 2x 6Gb/s and 2x 3Gb/s, should i buy a an hba sas and buy one of those sas to 4 sata splitters? Since i will be needing at least 1 more slot for the boot ssd. And do you have any recommendation for the hba?
 Should i even go with TrueNAS or should i go with Unraid (i read that they have a sw raid where you can have different size disks in it)
 I'm fairly new to this so any help is much appriciated :D.

Like a giant cdn but provided my individuals who are willing to share their bandwidth (with limitations) or host FOSS software like searxng across all the nodes so it will never go down. It might be hard but can we do this? I can acquire a lot of IPv6 ips and we could try to boost IPv6 in a small way. We could use anycast as load balancing
 EDIT1: I get the legal implications with a cdn. So it is a hard choice. We could disable video or sharing or large files. But we can easily run Foss software for people who can't maintain that software to be up 24/7 or people who can't. It can be a centralized place for a decentralised network.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've got several HGST Ultrastar HUSMM1616ASS200/HUSMM1616ASS204 that I bought as a bundle. I thought they were identical (except for the minor difference in encryption bits (the 4 vs 0), which I don't care about). 
 However, they fall into two groups:
  
EMC Branding: These show up on my computer as "HGST" disks, with the HGST part number HUSMM1616ASS200.
 HP Branding: These show up with the HP model number M01600JEFPC.
  
Question: How do I get the latest version of the HP and HGST firmware and the tool to flash it on to these drives? My understanding is that trying to flash regular HGST firmware onto HP OEM drives or vice versa would be an ... unwise ... idea.
 I should note that they're all working (even though the power lights don't stay lit on the HP drives when they're in my Supermicro backplane), but I'm aware that the latest firmware can optimize power usage/data integrity/etc.
 Thanks!

 amazon nuc in question 
 So my wife and I like to play games with our friends that usually involves her paying for a dedicated server. She is the one that typically handles it so I am a little in the dark about things.
 I have a very vague idea of what would be needed for a home server, but I could be way off the mark. 
 With Christmas coming up I wanted to get her something to mess with when it comes to having her own home server for just our friend group. We spoke lightly on the subject of just getting a home server. The interest is there, the knowledge is lacking, so having kind of a cheap starter setup seems like a decent enough way to go. 
 As for games, we would most likely have mod Minecraft, V Rising, Farming simulator, terraria, ect.
 We would typically have less than 10 people at any time, and the interests of the group swaps almost monthly in a rotation of games. So probably wouldn't need to be running multiple servers at once, but just have the ability to switch between them. 
 Thanks in advance for helping a well intentioned oblivious husband.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 I'm wanting to setup Exchange Server in my home lab (Specifically 2019 but even just 2013 or 2016 will work) with the full shebang, configuring MX records, what ports to forward, making it so I can actually use it as an email server on the Internet and I'll be honest, all the posts I've seen on Google are either hard to follow (Many have broken images or just don't have them at all) or don't cover everything you would need to setup to make it work, some only cover installing it on Windows and stop there and others just try and coax you to use 365. But I want to know everything, so that I can set it up from scratch and know how to do these things.
 I have a static IPv4 address along with static IPv6, I use OPNsense as my gateway and I'm fairly proficient with it, I have AD setup as a sub-domain of my primary domain, I make use of Cloudflare as the DNS provider for my root domain, the only ports my ISP blocks are 135 and 139 which I've checked does not use any more, and finally, I have a two tier ADCS PKI setup which handles certificates internally and I do have a NGINX container on Docker that manages the public facing services and uses Let's Encrypt.
 What I am looking for is a series of tutorials that will go over everything with Exchange Server, something similar in structure to the MJCB link below for ADCS which goes to Hades levels of depth it seems and made setting up a two tier PKI really easy to get my head around.
 MJCB Link: https://mjcb.io/blog/2020/03/09/certificate-authority-windows-server-2019-part-1/
 Many thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got to the point now where the number of both hardware and software is at the point where monitoring health/status/logs needs to be centralized.
 Some of my hardware has options for remote log servers, or provide public/private SNMP traps.
 Some OS have the ability to forward logs.While some software have APIs/XML/SOAP for polling statuses.
 An overview of Docker and kubernetes running/error/IO/general usage would also be handy.
 I've been looking at a few results from google but my experience so far has left more questions than answers.
 Also some of the prices are focused on SMB / enterprise licencing and not suitable for homelabs. I'm really focused on community projects or opensource where possible.
 ​
 ​
 Question: What's everyone using for centralized logging ?
 ​
 What I'm hoping to do / hoping for :
  
I'd really like to find a way to access and log my switches' SNMP trap info about port status and monitor traffic stats, port disconnects or high traffic alerts would be amazing
 I don't want to install an 'agent' or application in each VM or docker where possible.
 The output should have a webUI if possible
 Options for IPMI would be cool for the management cards on the bare metal servers (most if not all of mine have telnet or ssh options)
 I don't need to monitor windows based machines
 Log retention options would be nice (day/week/month)

 Where else have you folks gone to college where licenses are provided, and what was in their catalog?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Could somebody help me set this up as it is 3rd day I am struggling to find a solution.
 I recreated all my containers through stacks in Portainer (previously did that in Synology docker GUI). I have typical containers like qBittorrent, Emby, Netdata (don't use arr's for my needs).
 I wanted to organize a nice interactive dashboard but it fails to pass the connection test, both in Organizr and Heimdall so I end up with static dashboard and information that it fails to connect (to be precise cURL error 28: timeout after 5000 ms).
 Somebody at Organizr discord suggested this: ' I would think more something with the way syno does it's routing for docker... it might be worth switching your containers over to compose (or at least a custom network) where you can use docker dns to do the inter app communication' and pointed to follow this guide:
 https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/How-to-setup-for/Synology/
 I tried to do the testing for a coulpe of hours but it was beyond me, so I recreated all of containers through stacks in Portainer, still no dice.
 Could someone point me what to try next?

 I'm building my first home server and wanted to build something power efficient but that could also do anything I threw at it for quite a while. The two CPU's I've been looking at are the 12700k and the 12700t. My thought process was to buy the 12700t but the performance seems to be on par with an i5. I then thought to buy the 12700k and undervolt it to be as power efficient as the 12700t. Which route should I take and can the 12700k be as power efficient on idle as the 12700t? I have found both for the same price.

 i set up a new keycloak instance on docker with docker compose.
 Everything seems fine so far, i just cant login into the admin console, because i get an endless loop of "Loading the admin console"
 My docker-compose.yml:
 version: '3' services: mysql: image: mysql:latest container_name: kc_mysql hostname: db.kc.domain.de env_file: - ./keycloak.env ports: - 127.0.0.1:3306:3306 volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/mysql:/var/lib/mysql restart: unless-stopped networks: - keycloak keycloak: image: quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:latest container_name: kc_keycloak hostname: kc.domain.de env_file: - ./keycloak.env ports: - "8080:8080" - "8443:8443" volumes: - /var/lib/docker/volumes/kc_ssl:/srv/ssl command: start restart: unless-stopped networks: - keycloak depends_on: - mysql 
 The env-file:
 MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret MYSQL_USER=db_keycloak MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret KC_DB_USERNAME=db_keycloak KC_DB_PASSWORD=secret KC_DB=mysql KC_DB_URL_HOST=mysql KC_DB_URL_PORT=3306 KC_DB_SCHEMA=keycloak KC_HOSTNAME=kc.domain.de KC_PROXY=edge KC_PROXY_ADDRESS_FORWARDING=true KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT=false KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_FILE=/srv/ssl/kc.domain.de.cert.pem KC_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE=/srv/ssl/kc.domain.de.key.pem # KC_HOSTNAME-STRICT-BACKCHANNEL=true KC_KEYCLOAK_ADMIN=admin KC_KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD=secret KC_HEALTH_ENABLED=true KC_METRICS_ENABLED=true 
 Actually i dont have a reverse proxy configured, yet - this will be the next step. I am trying to access the docker-host / container directly.
 I also tried it with start-dev mode, but hat the same result.
 Thanks for your help in advance,

 I bought SFF-8087 to sata breakout cables, and it booted, showing no disks attached.. Disks didn't spin up.
 I learnt that SFF-8087 OCR (aka reverse aka crossover?) is what I need, so I bought those.. These to be exact: https://www.inline-info.com/en/products/cable/sas/5540/inline-sas-cable-mini-sas-sff8087-to-4x-sata-direct-ocr-0.75m

 What second-hand hardware should I be looking at for lab use? Thinking Cisco MDS if I can, but don't know what to really look for. Also don't know what SAN tech I should look for that won't murder my wallet in the second-hand market. I run TrueNAS at home, but their FC capabilities are only available with their Enterprise license.

After unscrewing, I noticed that some of the connectors to the PCB of the Sata Connector were loose. In an effort to safe the thing by resoldering the pins, one broke. So I just desoldered the entire thing. Now I was wondering, is there any hope left for my drive? Could a skilled solderer just solder on a new connecter. It’s not really about the data, I just don’t want to buy a new drive :)
 Thanks for any help/advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am considering putting a row of HDD cages on a 1u tray and zip-tie them down. Each cage would have a 120mm fan. Example of cage: HDD Cage
 I would then have an HBA from my NAS go to each drive. Alternatively, I may mount a backplane/cage (but I can't figure out how to cool these appropriately).
 Will the drives being open-air help or hurt airflow? My instinct is that it would help, but I wonder if the exposure will prevent air from flowing in the direction I want.
 How would y'all power these? Should I tie down a PSU in the middle of the same tray? Is there a non-PSU alternative that would be cheaper? A PSU is capable of so much that it seems wasteful to only power hard drives.
 And most importantly - is this stupid / am I crazy? Are there things I haven't considered? Should I just get a rack mount case and be done with it? I'm having trouble finding what I need in a case.

This gives me enough space to consolidate my data on lots of smaller drives into a single server and get rid of either my 2014 Unraid build or Synology DS918+. I am thinking I will keep the Unraid, but ready to be convinced otherwise.
 Unraid: 8 Drive Fractal Design Define R4 Case, Gigabyte H61MA-D3V, i3-2120, 8gb ram
 DS918+: No mods, holds 4 drives.
 I've tried a few transfers of different folders to both NAS units this evening. The Unraid seems to be about 5-10% faster. I'm more confident using the DS918+ and day-to-day that tends to be the device I use more frequently, but I figure the DS918+ is now end-of-life and the stats suggest I'm getting marginally better performance from the Unraid, not to mention future value.
 Is this a no-brainer? Or should I consider keeping the DS918+?
 My total data is only about 25tb, so the 3 x 18tb drives will be sufficient; leaving a spare bay even in the synology.
 Grateful for thoughts. Thanks!

 These come in on a variety of different services and I've been tasked at coming up with some sort of automated solution to handle off this traffic. 
 We currently have an 30TB Unraid server that's near full, but the plan was to build another server, probably TrueNas with 60TB+ as the main rig with the Unraid server doing midnight backups. Obviously we would expand the Unraid server to match whatever capacity the TrueNas system is capable of. 
 Where I'm at, is since a lot of these electronic services don't use Dockers, was to run a Windows VM and have the various services auto-download into with own share. I'd like to use dockers but that doesn't seem at possible with all of the services. 
 Next I'd like to figure out a way to catalog these and send some sort of notification once the download is completed. Slack or Email preferred. 
 Next would be the hardware consideration, should we use the Unraid or TrueNas servers to host the VM, or would getting another server just to host the virtual machines be advisable. 
 Cost can be whatever, we know this is going to cost some real money, so any solution at this point isn't off the table.

I found it with the plastic of the cover to the left of the USB port bent out and slightly broken but not melted i think a firefighter may of stepped on it. There is a very slight smell of soot but no visual smoke damage and the hard drive it’s self seems fine. No rattling sounds either. I think it is also very possible that it may of gotten wet from the hoses but this was about 3 months ago so dry now. If i plug it in to retrieve data am i risking damaging it? Should i give it to a specialist before attempting this? Thank you for any answers!

 The community, fortunately, has his "savers", especially hpcalc.org (see https://www.hpcalc.org/torrents/ ). I added some collections too (see https://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-9090.html ).
 My question would be, does anyone know if the Casio community, the sharp community or the TI community produced similar efforts? I wouldn't mind to help sharing the collection of those communities as well.

 I recently got a Minisforum MINI-S, so I've been setting it up to be my main server. My current shortlist is as follows:
  
Traefik as the proxy
 Nextcloud for files and maybe photos
 Immich for photos if not Nextcloud
 Syncthing (already installed) for smaller file shares accessible anywhere
 tailscale (already installed) for remote access
 Timeshift for backup to disk.
 Homeassistant
 Emacs server for access over ssh
 misc small services like discord bots.
  
Anything I've missed? 
 My main restrictions are that I'm behind a CGNAT and the hardware itself.
 The hardware is:
  
CPU: Intel(R) Celeron(R) N5095 @ 2.00GHz
 RAM: 8Gb DDR4
 Storage: 128 Gb M.2 SATA SSD + 1Tb Extenal HDD
  
Currently I also have a raspberry Pi3B dedicated to being my filtered DNS/DHCP, and soon-to-be-deprecated Syncthing 'server'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I finally got PhotoPrism up and running and have run into a couple of issues that are kind of annoying but seem to be limitations of the platform. I really like the way it gives me the option to browse my horribly disorganized photo collection by location, date, etc. It's a phenomenal product and I'm not bashing it at all, it does have some limitations though. 
 First, there is no way to bulk edit the AI-generated tags. For example, I have pictures of things like theme parks and computers that are tagged as "animal" and the only way to sort that tagging is one by one. 
 Another issue is there is a default Admin account and no other users are possible. I'd like to be able to give my family members "user level" access accounts so they can browse photos without accidentally breaking something. 
 I'm wondering if there are any alternatives out there for self-hosted photo management that would have these features. I have a little over 3TB of digital pictures and videos that I've managed to hoard over the years and I'm not comfortable putting them in the cloud.
 It would also be nice if I could find something that could write metadata tags back to the pictures and move them to different physical folders on the server. Obviously, that would have its own pitfalls, but it's just a thought.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[first off.... the code + demo:
 Repository - includes a GIF demo 
 What is AmbientWeather?
 AmbientWeather sells weather stations and other sensors for you to setup at your home to get local weather data. These stations can also share this information with WeatherUnderground and the AmbientWeather Network.
 ​
 What does your tool do?
 Some AmbientWeather stations support publishing metrics to a local webhook. AmbientWeather Local Server (AWLS) provides a self-hostable webhook that can receive the data from your local station and re-publish it as time series data (specifically prometheus metrics). This time series data can then be backed up locally and/or used in various visualization tools such as Grafana. 
 If your station supports it, AWLS gives you the option to keep your data 100% local.
 ​
 Which weather stations are supported?
 Unfortunately, the AmbientWeather documentation is not very clear in this regard. I developed this tool using a WS-2000 station. Additionally, you may need to update your firmware before your station displays the option to configure a custom webhook.
 ​
 What if my station doesn't support local webhooks?
 What I like about AmbientWeather is that they also have a public cloud API that anyone can use. This means that even if your station does not support local webhooks, you can configure AWLS to instead scrape your stations data from the AmbientWeather Networks cloud API. While not fully locally, this does allow you to create a local backup of your data and/or use it in local visualization tools.
 ​
 Anything else?
 So far I have a sample size of one. For my weather station model and my use case, AWLS works perfectly. But I'm sure there exists differences I haven't accounted for with other station models or other folks setups. If you give this tool a try and hit any issues, please be patient and feel free to open an Issue or post on the Discussion board.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This will be my 5th PC build, first time utilizing RAID. I have all parts assembled except for the storage. My concern is that Windows 10 may not be the best choice of OS for this type of build. 
 What kind of problems should I expect? 
 Do you recommend a different OS? 
 Can you even run Windows from a large Raid array or will one of the drives need to be dedicated to the OS? 
 I am an artist / photographer who will use this PC as a home network to store my huge library of work and also function as a media server (Plex). 
 Would I be better off with RAID 5 over RAID 1?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a USB3 dual disk dock and have two spare 4TB drives left over that I thought I would put in there and have Windows use them as RAID1, BUT I noticed. USB disks cannot be converted to dynamic disk and hence, not possible to do the ”ADD MIRROR”. What is the best way to be able to achieve this? My idea is that if one disk fails, it just keeps working with the one disk and I can replace that and the mirror will rebuild. And the idea was to use software raid so I could read the disk on any system.
 I also have a Linkstation that I could put those disks into, but I would prefer to not be bound to the hardware.
 I read about windows storage spaces also, but from what I read, it seems it would not simply keep working if one disk fails like I was planning?
 If nothing else, I would just have to use them both individually and setup my robocopy to just copy to both of them…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I'm using a Pi 4 as a media server and currently using mergerFS to pool multiple drives which works great. I also have a 10TB parity drive and a cron job to do nightly syncs to the parity drive. The issue is the parity drive is nearly full. I just added a 5TB drive as a second parity drive but was looking for a way to pool it in the same way I'm pooling the main drives with mergerFS.
 I'm not currently using SnapRaid but was considering installing/configuring it, but can't quite tell if that will accomplish what I need. Or, is it possible to just use mergerFS and add a second line in /etc/fstab to pool the two parity drives? Then, I would change the cron job to sync to the mergerFS virtual parity drive. 
 Any advice is greatly appreciated!

 I'm stuck and can't figure out what's wrong. I was wondering if anyone has any tips or solutions I could try. I have a PiHole and PiVPN set up. PiVPN is using Wireguard and is set to use the PiHole as DNS. 
 When I connect a wireguard client, I see the client's DNS requests on the PiHole admin panel. For example, oauth.reddit.com shows up as a fulfilled DNS request from a .pivpn client. However, the client never displays the web page. `wg show` and the Wireguard phone app show that packets are being transferred between the VPN host and client, but the data volume is very small. 
 Has anyone seen this behavior before? Is there anything I should try? I have Fios.
 Thanks!

 I'm using Univention Corporate Server as a directory service for my user administration (several family members).

 I followed this guide, but when I try to sync my users, I always get the following error:

 My settings for importing the users are as follows:

 Calibre-Web manages to connect to UCS, but can't find any users to import. All users who should have access to Calibre are members of the group "App-Calibre" (same structuce, e.g. "App-Nextcloud" for access to Nextcloud works just fine).
 Can you help me to find my mistake in the settings?
 Best regards,

 Hi guys, I'm starting with selfhosting and started thinking "ok, I have a bunch of ports, how to serve this?"
 I started with nginx and setting one url for each container I have, like http://domain/app. This proved to be a pain to setup, since some problems (static files like bla.js being loading as http://domain/bla.js instead of http://domain/app/bla.js for example) and etc. Then I changed everything to http://app.domain since it is way easier to setup.
 And you guys, what pattern do you use for your links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using rclone for years on my Linux server. I have a script I wrote that backed up data, logged in, and sent pretty HTML emails with status.
 For complicated reasons, I am getting rid of my Linux server and moving everything to my daily driver Windows 10 machine.
 I don't have time or patience to write a new script. I know I can use my old Linux script using WSL or something but I'm hoping for something more native to Windows.
 I was looking at alternatives to rclone that are easier to use on Windows like GoodSync but, honestly, when I do research, everyone says they all have issues and rclone is the best (it is).
 I don't want to re-create the wheel. I feel like this is a common problem that someone must have solved.
 If not, I feel like there is a huge opportunity here for someone to wrap a pretty basic GUI around rclone for Windows. Something that'll let you create scheduled tasks with features like email notifications and what not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I've been using Mubi to keep track of movies I've watched for the past 10 years through their "favourites" feature. At some point I think they introduced "lists" and only included this and reviews on their app. I just logged on to find they removed favourites entirely, so my collection is just gone. I emailed support about it and they just said they removed it because it was redundant and not on the app... the whole situation is just dumb. And with no warning.
 So is there any possible way to see it again? It's not on WayBack and I already tried Google cache, I can see the collection on my profile but can't click/access it. I also tried it with the direct link but it didn't work. It was quite personal to me, if anyone has any suggestions it would be super appreciated. (I'm on Mac btw)

 However when trying to connect outside of my home network i cant access it, after som troubleshooting I remembered that the raspberry pi is running a vpn and that is probably why i cannot access it from outside the network.
 ​
 Is there anyway i can go around this or is the only option to disable the vpn or get another server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So about 4 years ago, I was looking for a solution to get 2 ethernet ports back to my brother's room using an existing coax with the device being remotely powered. What I came up with was taking 2 DirecTV DECA adapters, I took an antronix power inserter and used it to deinsert power so I could split it to the two DECA devices, but I found out that there are no existing splitters on the market that power pass on more than one point simultaneously so I had to make my own DC splitter by taking an old crappy splitter prying the glued back off and cutting out the magnet wire and ferrites and soldered a piece of copper wire between all the ports. Then I used a bunch of female to female f couplers and a vertical splitter to try to make it as clean as possible. I only really ever used the device for testing, I never got around to installing it as I intended and then I went back to Comcast and the coax was no longer dead so it sat in a box until I found it today.

So what did I do? I cleaned up my desk and then pulled each of my ESXi hosts from my lab and configured Intel vPro and AMT and put them back. 
 vPro/AMT was one of the things I was looking for when I upgraded my lab last year and replaced all my Dell Precision hosts with these Lenovo Tiny pc's. 
 I am amazed at how well this works, no more disassembling my rack when I need bios access. And MeshCommander runs on my mac, so no need to boot up a windows VM either to manage this stuff. 
 Is anyone else using vPro/AMT in their homelab? I know a lot of folks run iLo or similar on their commercial grade servers.

 I was told by someone I should download to D first and then transfer in order to not make the WD too busy.
 But I don’t have much space in D, so if I do this it may be a little annoying to download little portions and then transfer. And if I do so, I don’t know if it’s good whether I keep my WD constantly connected or disconnect and reconnect it several times.
 On the other hand, I can just download directly to the WD. I just wonder if it’s safe for it, as I’ve heard the small ones which are not SSD are very sensitive and vulnerable.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I've been struggling with this for a bit and was hoping someone could shed a light on the issue for me.
 I have an external server pointed to example.com with the intention to eventually reverse-ssh a connection to my internal Nextcloud instance at nextcloud.example.com.
 I also host a dnsmasq server in order to make nextcloud.example.com point to the internal IP when I'm on the internal network instead of the external IP.
 To be clear, currently only example.com should point to the external server IP and nextcloud.example.com should point to the internal server IP.
 This works fine for a short amount of time after I connect to the network, and then suddenly it's reading the Cloudflare record instead and says it can't find nextcloud.example.com. I can disconnect from wifi and reconnect and it works fine for 10-20 minutes and then starts having the same problem.
 Even though I have my client configured to use my dnsmasq server only (which then forwards requests it doesn't know to an external server,) it still inevitably ends up looking to Cloudflare instead of dnsmasq.
 I'm so confused as to why it would work for a bit and then just stop, especially since I'm telling my client to only talk to dnsmasq in this instance. Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

 Looking for some help installing ESXi 8 on a 3050 USFF, seems to be a normal Network Driver missing issue because of the Realtek NIC. I mostly have Linux devices at home and haven't been able to get the network Fling into the installer. I am also trying with a fresh Windows VM, but I'm getting errors installing the PowerCLI tool. 
 Does anyone know of a guide on how to package it up on Linux or know of a prepackaged ISO I can use? Or is this a bit of a lost cause?
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of cat6a to run in my attic. I picked up what seems like good cable (Monoprice Cat6A Plus, 10G, 650MHz, UTP, Solid, Riser-Rated (CMR) 23AWG) and have been having a very difficult time terminating it into male ends (punch-block keystones are fine of course).
 I tried two sized of connectors ("trueCABLE Cat6A Extra Large RJ45 Pass Through" and "trueCABLE Cat6/6A RJ45 Pass Through Connectors") paired with two types of crimp tools ("trueCABLE All-In-One Crimp and Termination Tool, Compatible with Cat5e, Cat6, Cat6A Ethernet RJ45 Connectors" and a Klein tools variation).
 I am stripping well, careful in placement and crimping fully. Still, I get continuity failures on most pins. Am I jsut not applying enough force, or have I chosen fundamentally incompatible connectors? 
 Any hints welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: which domain registrar would you recommend besides GoDaddy or Google Domains?
 I've heard the horror stories about GoDaddy before. They're arguably one of the most recognizable names in domain registration/websites etc. I didn't have any problems with them; until I did. I spent an hour and a half on the phone last night trying to sort out an issue that should be simple. The person on the phone was obviously following their support script and I don't blame them for that, but how many times do we need to re-create the issue before you escalate it? I don't want to go into too may details; but let's just say it seems like their two factor authentication, or should I say "2SV", is not well implemented in their system.
 For those interested in my use case: I currently use various domains (around half a dozen) for self hosted (on prem/in cloud) services such as file servers, VPNs, and email. All of this is done with providers outside of my current domain registrar. Some DNS is done with my current registrar and some is done with other companies. 
 So, with that said; which domain registrar should I move to? Obviously GoDaddy is out. I have nothing against Google Domains, but I would like to stay away from them as I am trying to reduce the number of Google services I rely on and there have been plenty of stories lately about people being locked out of their Google account for one reason or another (See the story of the father locked out of his account for sending a photo of his son to his doctor).

 BeatLog parses and processes NGINX and fail2ban log data into a PostgreSQL database, so you can then assess your server traffic to your heart's (get it?) desire. Here is the data structure for the logs.
 I use SWAG for my reverse proxy, but it should be compatible with any common log format -- so not Caddy, and maybe Traefik depending on settings. You can also add locations to all the data using the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 Some other features I'm proud of and use:
  
Characterize IP addresses as "Home" or "Outside", based on server's current public IP address.
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren't found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names

The built in exhaust fans don't seem capable of pulling enough air out of the top of the rack, so I am considering adding fans at the bottom to help get flow going. The rack has its solid back panel against a wall, and pulls air in through its front mesh. 
 What are the pros/cons of fan panels vs fan trays? 
 Is there a better solution that I am not thinking of? 
 I currently keep the room AC (my living room) at 70°F and the rack temp probe constantly reads high 90°'s, over 100 if my AC acts up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My home server is currently a colossally massive server with dual xeons and it's hilariously overkill for my needs. I'd like to go quieter and small (and ideally, rackmount, though I have one of those startech narrow depth racks)
 So I'm wondering if anyone is aware of something that meets the following:
 - Rackmount (I can deal with anything up to 4U, reasonably).
 - Narrow depth.
 - Enough space for 4x3.5" drives.
 - Provisions for at least ONE PCI-e card.
 I'm willing to build from a case up, or an all-in-one solution. The server will run Linux and does not require much processing power at all.
 Is anyone aware of a product/case/anything that I can reasonably get off-the-shelf that will fit these needs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow hoarders 
 After buying the DS920+ from Synology last month to replace my good old 10 or 11-year-old Thecus N2200 with 2x 1 TB, the time has come to buy the drives.
 At the moment, I have inside the DS920+, 3x 2 TB units + 1 TB unit.
 My idea in buying the NAS, is to have an easy place where to put my family photos, back up from the phones to the NAS automatically (ditching google photos), use a surveillance station with 2x cameras and the extra space is for building a media library.
 I thought to buy 2 big units, shuck them, and put them inside the NAS in SHR RAID type; at the same time, put one 1 TB drive plus one 2 TB drive that came out of the NAS, inside the cases where the big drives came, connect them to RaspPIs with Rsync, one at my home other at brother-in-law, to automatically back up the family photos folder which I don't want to lose.
 ​
 After looking at disk prices .com I found the 2 best deals at Amazon DE are the 18 TB Western Digital Elements units at €16.06/TB (€289) and the second-best deal is the WD My Book 16 TB at €16.5/TB (€264). 
 After reading around some older threads in the sub, I see some fellow hoarders point out the fact My Book has hardware encryption, making it not desirable to shuck and put it in the NAS. My first question is: Is this still true nowadays?
 My second question is, what drives are normally in?
 I wanted to limit my expenses to around €300, which would get me 2x 8 TB, but this would also limit my future expandability, while 2x 16 TB seems much more future-proof for a bit more than €500. 
 In your opinion, is this achieveable?
 Are there any deals I should look into? 
 What would you buy nowadays?

 Newbie here seeking for advice. I recently got a DL380 Gen9 from Ebay to start my homelab. After I paid the money I started to realize I've thown myself into a hole that I would become addictive.
 Now with the server sitting in my room I found a few problems that I haven't expected and I would like to see if anyone can give me some advise or direction. Much appreciated!
  
The server is loud, expectedly. Although not after system is up but when system is busy I could hear the fans ramp up. I might consider throw it into garage but the official doc says it shall operate under 35C. Will garage ok for it (btw I live in south Florida)?
 The original server comes with a xeon 2620 V4, I managed to get a deal of two 2650 V4 for just $20. However I found it requires a CPU cage to install the CPUs. I managed to reuse the one from the old CPU and just put the other one directly int CPU slot without cage. So far it seems working fine. Anyone has experience with this? Will I get into trouble?
 The biggest question I have actually is how to get my existing drive work on it. I have 1 4T and 2 6T drives. The two 6T is currently managed by lsi 9271 card as raid 1. the 4T is currently connect to my workstation directly. The server has P840ar on it. Is there a way to import those drives to 840ar with data kept? I want to use HBA by the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I'd like to set up a white box NAS that has some high-capacity HDDs with two mirrored 1TB or 2TB SSDs for additional fast storage. The goal with those is to keep the HDDs from spinning up every time the pool is accessed (for both a power and a noise perspective). I'd like for it to automatically shuffle data around periodically based on usage (i.e. most-used data stored on the SSDs).
 Is there anything that supports this? (Ideally with a nice GUI - nothing in Linux ever seems to "just work" from the command-line) I've messed around with TrueNAS in the past, but it doesn't seem like it can do any of what I'm mentioning (it cannot let the HDDs go to sleep (or something along those lines), cannot shuffle data around based on usage, and you can only use SSDs as a "cache" where the data is offloaded to the HDDs instead of having mirrored SSDs that actually store information).
 Thank you

When I add the line "proxy_http_version 1.1;" to my config, the proxy goes offline with the error "'proxy_http_version' directive is duplicate in /data/nginx/proxy_host/14.conf:60", but as far as I can tell that file doesn't exist. Whether I browse the filesystem through the host OS or open a shell inside the container and navigate to that folder, there is no 14.conf file. Any idea what could be happening here?
 Edit: I don't actually need this line to work to fix the issue I was having with Nextcloud, I just want to understand what is happening here
 Edit 2: Two additional notes
 - The host OS is Unraid
 - The /data directory doesn't actually exist, it redirects to /config. Not sure what to call that, and also not sure if that's related or not

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At first I was going to get two large 12-16 TB drives and put them into RAID 1, but after thinking about it is putting five or six 4 TB drives in RAID 5/6 a dumb idea for a beginner? The dollar/GB ratio is better and in case of a drive failure it's much cheaper to fix at $80-ish bucks a drive vs $220, but that is a lot more moving parts and probably over double the power in drives. I'm gonna be using it for ripping and hosting the family's DVD collection, my Blurays, PS2 games, and some important file backups. I'll be using a retired 4670k and 16gb of ram as the base for the system.
 Actually, thinking about it now would it just be easier to see how far 4TB RAID 1 takes me and just upgrade to RAID 5/6 (if you can do that) from there if it looks like I can use all of those drives? Honestly I didn't really think about that until now.
 Also, hardware or software RAID? Every time I look it up I see hardware RAID is a headache or software RAID is a headache, so I have no idea what the current consensus is.
 Thanks for any help.

 When the ALB receives connection request from port 443, it will forward to my target group with http setup. It has my ssl certificate attached 
 Then in cloudfront, I set my ALB as the origin, and then set HTTPS, redirect http to https, and put my domain as the alternative domain and the ssl certificate. (Same as my ALb cert) 
 And then I added the Alias record 
 domain.com -> my cloudfront endpoint
 But after 15mins, when I refresh my pages, the cache is missed, it directly accessed to my origin. I don’t know if it’s related to the cachedisabled feature I set up in cloudfront…. 
 Do you guys have any ideas?

 this weekend, you can access every ebook on packtpub without a subscription.
 Does somebody have a script for a mass download? 
 I searched on github but most of the scripts are outdated and none seems to be able to download books which you dont "own". 
 Maybe a person with the skill is able to write a script this weekend. Sadly I dont have the knowledge to do so.

 I was wondering what is the best way to go about having some system to routinely check if the data has become corrupted? I could hand roll some script to calculate md5 sums for each file. I also thought about making one big torrent for each hard drive so I can verify the checksums that way. Are there any other standard methods of doing so?
 Thank you!

I'm now at a point where I feel like the next few services I want to get running would involve long-term data storage, so attaching several disks for backup purposes would be essential
 My question is: how feasible would it be to attach drives through usb? The laptop motherboard only has one free SATA port available, but two usb ports. Would I run into issues with read/write speeds? How relevant is that question when considering data backups? And if I used a usb hub, would that make a significant difference?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am trying to figure out if this makes sense and if I am on the right track. Current setup is one HP 290 with numerous applications running out of a single Dockers setup (one compose file) behind Traefik. I did not anticipate setting up so many applications and the machine has been struggling some. I see this as a good chance to learn and expand a bit as I have some hardware hanging around which could be put to good use. 
 I was thinking of setting up a PI4 where I would install Traefik, Guacamole and probably PiHole. Then a separate host would run front end applications (like Plex, Navidrome and similar) and another would run back-end applications (‘arrs and similar). I would have three compose files running on 3 different hosts tied to one reverse proxy. If I understand correctly I would need to set up my Docker-Compose files and Traefik in swarm mode so that I can route though the PI. 
 Does this architecture make sense (good or bad) and are there things I am missing which may turn out to be headaches if I do this? I have looked around (Google) but if anyone has done this (or something similar), has a better alternative or can point to a good guide I appreciate the feedback.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 For a webapp of mine, Excel file/ODS/CSV import feature was requested, however instead of supporting a fix scheme(s), they wish to have bigger flexibility: some columns should be optional, sometimes the numbers, dates are formatted differently (because of the different locales) in those sheets, sometimes there could be a header row, or the values are starting at the 5th row, etc.
 I think these requirements are pretty general, they've certainly come up a lot, in a lot of software - personally I had to build it a couple of times, so I'm a bit borred now, and started thinking how to solve it generally. So I would like to have a webapp that my application could integrate with, and when the user wants to upload a table, my application would redirect to this webapp, describing that X,Y and Z columns are needed, Z is optional, X must be a date, etc . There, the user could upload a file, visually select which columns are where, and when everything is correct, the processed table would be delivered to my application.
 Have you seen any similar application? Unfortunately, my google searches are only showing up no-code/low-code solutions how to turn a single excel/csv sheet into a webapp.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situation: Migrating away from Google apps for domains to mxroute/own existing domain and a self-hosted instance (probably mailcow) for the "archive". Using the time to remove a decade+ of online mail.
 Desire: Have the "old" mail (maybe greater than a year or so) available on the LAN through a service for the rare time it needs to be checked. Maybe in the future "add" new "old mail" to it. 
 Need: A good user interface with search. It does not need to be reachable for mail routing obviously.
 Thoughts: Mailcow via Docker, pull mail in with imap sync from Google before migrating to mxreoute solution.
 But... any better solution/anything I've overlooked for this family solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm facing the issue that moving from one server to another (which shouldn't happen often, yet has to happen at some point), is a huge burden to even think about.
 So... the answer to this is... obviously, containerization, where we separate applications from data. Let's talk docker.
 However, as someone paranoid with security, I can't understand how security updates and fixes are generally handled in docker.
 Take for example Standard Notes, or Gitlab. They both offer docker containers. Great. I can launch them with compose. But then my launch procedure would be docker-compose up and docker-compose down. But what about the operating systems inside these docker containers? The libraries inside of them?
 Usually on Linux, unattended-upgrades handles these for you. You never have to think about it. My servers' uptime can be over a year. It's not like I restart every weekend or something.
 But now for docker containers, I don't see a fixed recipe for doing that.
 How do you handle this issue? Do you have cron jobs that restart your containers every now and then and upgrade the images so that security fixes can come over? What do you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Rewritten for clarity because speedrunning a post like this tends to leave questions
 How to get started:
  
Install Python. There is a standalone .exe but this just makes it easier to upgrade and all that
 
Run pip install gallery-dl in command prompt (windows) or Bash (Linux)
 
From there running gallery-dl <url> in the same command line should download the url's contents
 
 config.json
 The config.json is located at %APPDATA%\gallery-dl\config.json (windows) and /etc/gallery-dl.conf (Linux)
 If the folder/file doesn't exist, just making it yourself should work
 The basic config I recommend is this. If this is your first time with gallery-dl it's safe to just replace the entire file with this. If it's not your first time you should know how to transplant this into your existing config

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, 
 I used poweriso to create a mountable image files from data because it can create image file from big directory (>10GB, 20GB ...) with a good compress ratio compared to .tar .rar. zip file.
 However, it's not safe as my antivirus program says.
 I'm looking for alternatives. What do you use to archive a huge amount of data?
 Thanks

 All the tools I can find are pay-to-use which is wild, except archive.org which only saves the most recent page of tweets from an account? Like a few days' worth roughly.

Offices will reopen on Monday, November 21st. .. We look forward to working with you on Twitter’s exciting future."
  
​
  
Story to be updated soon with more: Am hearing that several “critical” infra engineering teams at Twitter have completely resigned. “You cannot run Twitter without this team,” one current engineer tells me of one such group. Also, Twitter has shut off badge access to its offices.
  
​
  
What I’m hearing from Twitter employees; It looks like roughly 75% of the remaining 3,700ish Twitter employees have not opted to stay after the “hardcore” email. 
 Even though the deadline has passed, everyone still has access to their systems.
  
​
  
“I know of six critical systems (like ‘serving tweets’ levels of critical) which no longer have any engineers," the former employee said. "There is no longer even a skeleton crew manning the system. It will continue to coast until it runs into something, and then it will stop.” 
 Resignations and departures were already taking a toll on Twitter’s service, employees said. “Breakages are already happening slowly and accumulating,” one said. “If you want to export your tweets, do it now.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So one of my clients at work has an iMac that is used as a Data Server. They are in the process of upgrading it to an actual Apple Server but it is a slow process due to cost. 
 The problem is, they have 4 external hard drives that are used for backup purposes. Two are used for Time Machine backups, and the other two are used for data backups for a program they use. The old solution was that they were just swapping them out every week, but then we ran into the problem of corrupt drives (due to a USB hub not having enough power and failing intermittently). I now want all 4 plugged into the device at once to prevent this nightmare of a situation. The problem is, the iMac only has 4 USB ports on the back, and 3 are occupied and cannot be moved. One is used by a personal scanner which cannot be connected to a USB hub, another is the USB hub mentioned earlier, and a third is the Ethernet adapter which cannot be moved due to the actual Ethernet port on the iMac being broken.
 I need some ideas, because currently only one backup can really work properly as there is only one USB port available. Open to any ideas, thank you.

 I am thinking of building a DIY DAS, with a SilverStone DS380 and 8xHDD, but I need something odd that maybe does not exist.
 I would need to connect my DAS through an USB interface (USB3.0 is enough for mechanical HDD), so I am looking for an interface that convert the SATA or MiniSAS connectors to an external USB connector, preferably with a PCI bracket to fit the PCI slots of the case.
 To sum up, I need something like a SSF8087 to SSF8088 adapter (pic below) but SSF8087 to USB instead.

 I do not find anything similar to it, but thinking about all the commercial DAS (Yottamaster, IcyBox, Mediasonic...), they all have an external USB interface, that expose the SATA/SAS HDD in the interior, so the card must exist. 
 Thanks in advance.

 But now I want to make sure that I can always access the files because I need to serve them from a web server
 What solution do I need? ZFS? RAID?
 I need to be able to access the files as if I would access regular disk on the system
 I was planning to install it on a separate VM on the network (It's a little private project I'm doing, nothing too important)

 I know there are some very old models from SGI/Rackable system that have been mentioned here in the past, but I'm curious if you guys are aware of anything more modern?
 I'm preferably looking for something from a mainstream manufacturer with niceties like IPMI.
 I've come across the following models (primarily designed for 5G vRAN applications), but they seem to be too new, and aren't on the used market:
  
Supermicro sys-210p-frdn6t
 
Gigabyte E251-U70
 
Dell XR12
 
Lenovo ThinkEdge SE450

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just bought into VMUG and am excited to reconfigure my whole ESXi setup. I'll be using clustering for the first time and I think I know the answer to this but I wanted to be sure.
 My cluster for the time being is going to be a bunch of old laptops - I have a dl380p but it's physically elsewhere for a while. I have 2gbe through Google Fiber and the switches to support the throughput, but if I cluster these old laptops together and one of them doesn't have a NIC capable of that speed, then the whole cluster is going to suffer from a bottleneck across all resources right? 
 I guess I don't understand how to determine the bandwidth necessary for resource access in a cluster and if there is a determinable max throughput or if it's just "the more the better." 
 My question summarized though is: Will I bottleneck ESXi cluster performance if one of the nodes has a NIC that is significantly slower than the others?
 Thank you.

 I have a huge collection of obscure gaming books and materials. Including scans of rare developer interviews.
 I was reading the ArchiveTeam wiki and I found out that you can upload to archive.org using a torrent.
 https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/Internet_Archive#Uploading_to_archive.org
 "Torrent upload, useful if you need resume (for huge files or because your bandwidth is insufficient for upload in one go)"
 I don't have the best equipment so I want to use this method in case I have some sort of interruption.
 Is it recommended to use torrent upload? Is there any file size limits to it? Can it handle 10gb+ uploads?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 today my esxi 6.x is running on an old mac mini (2011, with a thunderbolt network adapter). It run mostly my pfsense firewall and some small test instances.
 With esxi 6.x endoflife, and VMUG only having esx i7.x + licences, I would like to move to a more uptodate hardware to use esxi 7.x.
 It need to be able to have 2 NICs (maybe one through thunderbolt or usb adapter) to run my pfsense firewall.
 Noise is also a concern, it will be on 24/7 in a small apartment.
 I understand most of the recent NUC may cover that ?
 ​
 I would also like to try GPU&USB passthrough with windows to be able to run windows virtual hosts and some 'game' on it. My main computer is a mac mini.
 How is the GPU passthrough with esxi 7.x and windows ? is it always a gamble for each hardware / software update ?
 Can I find a small SFF that I can add a modern graphic card ? or a 'tower' model with a modern graphic card that work ? Do I need to look at more 'server' style hardware (more noisy) ?
 Or forget about GPU passthrough and simply by an XBOX for Christmas ?
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Gl.Inet axt1800 Slate ax router which has micro sd up to 512gb and usb disks options for a Samba network share. I want to utilize this so I have all files in a single place on a network. I access the network both via 1gbs ethernet and wifi6.
 I don't want real bulky NAS that's why I chose this router because it's a portable solution.
 I'm in doubt which disk type to use. I need around 1TB of space. 
 Should I use 2.5 mechanic disk which may require additional power via usb hub which is less practical? Also I'm concerned about writing speed for a lot of small files like git repos or similar?
 Or should I use $70 nvme disk with 30$ usb adapter which is more expensive option but more performant?
 Another option is 50$ 512GB micro sd card which is less space and not so performant but could be an option.
 Which option should I choose?

 https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/wprm_print/26284

 There are hundreds of recipes, but the numbers at the end of the address jumps at random intervals (ex. 540, 588, 607, 690). Is there someway a scraper or something could go through and check every number to test if a page is there and then download the webpage?

I've been doing the later with about a dozen different distros, just periodically checking to see if they've been updated and downloading the new one manually. Works fine for a few ISOs, but it becomes a pain with more. Just wondering how other people are doing this.
 I've been bamboozled, y'all are just a bunch of horny nerds 🤣 
 More seriously, it looks like rsync and cron jobs is the smart way to go for actual Linux ISOs

 Hello self-hosted community, 
 First time here so please be nice 😊
 I would like to present to you my latest project (self-hosted of course), which I have been working on for the past few months, and I would be happy if it gets some exposure.
 So Introducing MonoBox: a music player that can stream songs from your computer's local library to your phone's app. 🎵
 This is a full-stack application, which I built by combining React Native with FastAPI.
 You are invited to read all about MonoBox and form your own opinions, and of course don't forget to star the repo! ⭐
 Check out the MonoBox repo!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit to answer FAQ: hardware choices are for cost and versatility, the whole budget for this build is under $350. Raid config is RAID 10 + 1 hot spare and four more drives on hand to swap in for failures. I am not afraid to cut holes in this case. 
 I've also posted this over on homeserver, but the level of jank I'm striving for fits a lot better here I think. 
 I'm currently working on building a home file server that could potentially host both Plex and Pi-Hole. I've already got the drives on the way but I have not ordered the rest of the hardware. Right now I am bidding on an auction for an Optiplex 7040 MT, i7-6700 with 8GB RAM. There will be a dedicated SSD for the OS. I know that the specs will be sufficient for any of the individual uses, but will they be enough for all three at once? Also, what would be the best way to install 11 drives? I'm not afraid of jank, so "creative" solutions are welcome. My array plans are for 11 2TB drives with 10 TB logical storage for full parity with 1 hot spare. I will also have 4 cold spares. Here are the solutions I'm looking for ideas on: 1. software. Currently thinking about Samba but would be open to any other free options
  
power. Will the 240w dell power supply be enough for 11 spinning platters or do I need another solution?
 
connection. Do I need to use a specific PCIe expansion card to make sure my OS can see all the drives?
 
physical mounting. How the heck can I get 11 drives connected to this thing?
 
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, selfhosted community,
 We're excited to announce that we launched Automatisch, an open-source Zapier alternative. We have been working on it for more than a year together with u/farukaydin and started to get early adopters. Now it's time to announce it to more prominent communities.
 In case you don't know what Zapier is, it is a product that allows end users to integrate the web applications they use and automate workflows.
 If you want to check it out directly, you can use the following links:
 Website: automatisch.io
 Docs: automatisch.io/docs
 GitHub: https://github.com/automatisch/automatisch
 If you want to check out the screenshots of the product:
  
Apps
 Flows
 Editor
 Executions
 Execution details
  
There are existing solutions like Zapier or Make in the market, but we still wanted to build Automatisch as an open-source alternative because you can keep your data on your own servers with Automatisch. It's a critical requirement for companies with private user data that can't be shared with any other external service, like most of the health or financial sector companies. European companies also have similar concerns with the current GDPR law with products hosted in the US.
 You can check the available integrations here. We currently have limited integrations, but we are working on adding more and improving the existing ones.
 Please give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback, and if you like what we are doing with Automatisch, please give us a star on GitHub.
 ​
 Edit: We have incorporated a brief description of Zapier in the post above.

 Obviously any reports are going to be anecdotal and not a guarantee, but I'm curious as to if any of you have experience with used enterprise drives and reliability in that region of use.
 From my own personal experience, it seems that if a drive is destined to die it tends to die relatively quickly, and the ones I've had in the past that made it to 10,000 hours typically lasted another 50k+.
 Ultimately I spent £30 a pop on each of these, so I'm tempted to just consider it a good deal regardless and put it out of my mind. Am I crazy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, few months ago, I bought EnGenius access points, EnSky EWS377APs x5, EWS850AP x1, SkyKey-1, and now there is a need for two more APs for the same site, and EnGenius just release a new line "Fit" which has no backward compatibility with EnSky , i.e SkyKey can't manage Fit APs, and FitController can't manage EnSky ; and EnGenius has no plan for EnSky series (old) to EnGenius Fit Series ( -FIT). 
 Given these facts, would you: 
 1- Get 2x EnSky EWS377AP (old line)
 2- Get 2x EWS377-Fit and 1x FitController 
 3- Burn all EnGenius **** and replace with something else, please suggest (not cloud managed).

 Thank you

Backblaze costs money per-device, but I have multiple devices so that solution doesn't work for me either. I also don't need more than 1TB.
 I'd like it to be as streamlined as possible (so no manual pushing/pulling, and preferably no complicated setups).
 Can anyone help?

More specifically, we rarely talk about the process of restoring, if it works, how well it works, etc. I read many folks say they couldn't restore cause of a corrupted backup because of the backup tool they used -- not cool.
 So, I'm wondering, for folks who have had to restore data and it was successful, what tool were you using to do the backup + restore? Comment with your thoughts/experience.

 As the number of services I selfhost increase I'm facing 2 problems. How to use the same password every ware (LDAP)? How to add login page to a service which didn't natively have one (SSO)?
 I've setup Authelia for SSO. It's nice and easy to setup.
 But I have trouble setting up openldap for the identity provider.
 Here is my question :
 Should I stick with openldap & Authelia combo or should I switch to a all-in-one solution (which one)?
 Thanks a lot

 I've recently been trawling the internet for an alternative to Cloudflare to sit my Plex/Emby behind, the most promising I've found is GCore, they're pretty upfront, you get 1TB, after that you pay - cool.. 
 But then I found Yakucap which is listed on ProductHunt, its got quite a few reviews etc, it got "product of the day" etc. 
  
https://www.producthunt.com/products/yakucap
 https://yakucap.com/
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js4R8scCDfk
  
It looks promising and probably worth bookmarking, but I'd say approach with caution for now - researching on LinkedIn, TrustPilot, and Y Combinator etc, their presence elsewhere is surface-thin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my personal mastodon server ran out of space. Mastodon is cache-happy but not 5TB happy, I thought my new Photoprism installation was the guilty party, but that was wrong too:
 Turns out I had mounted the remote storage root share via sshfs on /root/something (to find selfies for Photoprism). And /root/ is backed up in borg. And borg saves to remote storage. Whoops.
 Alas, even after deleting the problematic backups, the borg directory was still consuming 2TB+. I decided I don't particularly care for older versions of this server and tried deleting more backups, always doing borg compact, and prune to boot. Still 2TiB+. I got curious at this point, and borg-deleted every single backup. borgmatic list was empty. borgmatic compact. prune. du -sh. 2TB+.
 I finally looked it up, tried borg compact --threshold=0, and boom, free disk space.
 From my understanding this shouldn't be the behaviour, the default threshold is 10% and compact should be part of prune which I do regularly on borgmatic? but in any case I'm gonna add compact --threshold=0 to the crontabs after the weekly prune.
 Also while I'm writing for search engine future people: you can ugprade to borgbackup 1.2 (via pip if your distro doesn't have it) and run borg compact --cleanup-commits to clean up some data left over by a borg 1.1 bug. You only need to do that once per repo, and borg compact can be run server-side without repo keys.
 (n.b. don't do like me and delete your precious backups on impulse; you can use borg recreateto exclude specific files that were included by accident.)

I knew what i already got for the most part, but i never really made a list/labeled them. In total i guess somewhere around 250 floppys & 4-5000 cds.
 Since many of them are nearly 20 years some even older, i am looking for a way to digitalis them.
 The first thing, is there an efficient way/program to convert them to isos?
 The second thing, are you familiar with any archive/collection management program thats selfhosted and where you could link the said isos?
 (Like Collectorz just Selfhosted, Browserbased & OpenSource)
 Thanks for any ideas

 I’ve been considering some pooled sort of RAID like unraid or omv zfs for many years, and realize it means the loss of one drive for parity, but overall the bigger fear is that something will go wrong that will trash the entire pool of Files versus just one drives worth of content - tv and movie files which could be replaced. Anyone else have similar fears and how did you resolve? I just worry the implosion of say 100tb of a pool would be riskier than losing a regular 14tb drive. My drives are all of various size btw ranging from 5tb to 14tb all gutted from desktop cases so not bleeding edge. Also isn’t raid going to run slower than jbod on my 4u Xeon rackmount?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Kubero aims to be the most similar clone to run Heroku on your own Kubernetes (Cloud or selfhosted). It is 100% open-sourced.
 3 weeks ago, I promised this subreddit, I would build a CLI for Kubero, when the main repository reaches 100 ⭐. Thank you for this motivation booster. So here I am to deliver too.
 Kubero now has a CLI. And the best part is: It comes with an installer. So it is super easy to play around on your local environment. Spin up a Kind Kubernetes cluster, install OLM and Kubero just by running kubero install. This will start the fully guided installation.
 This is the current command tree:
  kubero ├── apps │ ├── create │ ├── fetch │ ├── list │ └── delete ├── config │ ├── addons │ ├── buildpacks │ └── podsizes ├── help ├── init ├── install └── pipelines ├── create ├── fetch ├── list └── delete 
 v0.0.3 is ready to download here: https://github.com/kubero-dev/kubero-cli/releases/latest

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The recent power price increases have hit our country hard, and a discussion with the CEO and CFO at Chez Knurpel led to a review of the heavy power users. Turns out that each of the two R710s sucked 270 Watt on average. They were replaced by one 16 core Threadripper machine I had sitting around. After fiddling with the power limits of its BIOS, the Threadripper box draws around 155W at the wall, while running the same VMs as the now disabled R710s. Savings: 385W. Bonus: The Threadripper machine is quiet (thank you, Noctua), it sits under my desk, and it heats the room in wintertime. The R710s were loud and needed their own air-conditioned (in summertime) room.
 The plan is to fire up one R710 once a month for a longer-term backup of the Threadripper machine. (No worries, 3-2-1 warriors: Like the R710s before, the Threadripper is backed up continuously to a NAS.)
 Sorry, lights out

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of DRM-free games on my NAS. I often use steam in big-picture mode. Every time I want to add a game I need to go into my NAS, drag it to my program files, and then create a shortcut through steam. Once I run out of space, I need to delete it, and the cycle continues. To make matters worse I basically use my system like a console. That's not even counting my multiple devices.
 It'd be great if there were a Steam-like alternative download client that could manage my already owned/downloaded games and had fullscreen controller support. I've never heard of such a thing but it'd be nice.
 My dream solution would be a way to integrate Steam with my already existing game libraries. Like Plex but for games. You'd be able to go to your game library and delete then reinstall your games on demand like any normal Steam game but it'd be sourced from your own NAS. It'd have some Steam features like file verification and proton support. 
 Steam has a command line option that might allow a limited execution of this. After doing some research maybe make a NAS server that's compatible with SteamPipe then adding the games through the command line? Thoughts?

 It's a long shot, but there is a chance someone had a similar issue. 
 The trouble is, at the very end on the system load, the NetApp "blinks", all the drives disconnect for a moment and then reconnect. With different device names. /dev/sdc it becomes the /dev/sdaa or something similar. It messes up the ZFS for some reason. Even thou it looks like the pools is created by disk ID's not by block device names:

 I think, something is faulty in my box. Either an LSI or the NetApp. This exact same thing happened in Ubuntu and now happens in the TrueNAS Scale.
 I have two cables, so far, I tried to connect a single cable to NetApp IOM1. I didn't try it with only IOM2. That would be a next thing to try, but I am not eager to mess with my data without absolute need.
 So far, I managed to load, by unplugging the NetApp, booting the NAS and hot-plugging it back. zpool import picks up the pool with no issues.
 Have anyone experienced anything similar?
 Thank you.

 I work for a company and we have digital files (raw footage, photos, edits, and project files) stored on about 100 HDDs, most are Lacie 2TB to 5TB capacity drives. We also keep a copy of these drive's contents on a cloud-based DAM system.
 I want to us to have a third storage option for our content so that we abide by the 3-2-1 rule and that considers long term storage, I'd say for the next 10-15 years.
 Altogether, we probably have close to 100 TB of data that would not need to be accessed frequently (we use the DAM for that). What are some storage/backup recommendations for this case?

 Weary of putting any data on the 5/6 drives even if they recognize. I email their support regarding the issue looking for a resolution. No real response for a week until they sent an email that it was forwarded to their 'IT" department; however what was weird was the ticket was 'closed'. 
 I emailed again to reopen the ticket 3-4 days later but no response. I emailed again another 3-4 days later with the same result. They are simply ignoring the support ticket even though there is a DOA Warranty for 30 days. I'm well paste the 30days and had to pay UPS customs/duties of $185. 
 BUYER BEWARE: I heard good things about these guys from the serverbuild forums years ago and thought I would give them a try. I am sorely mistaken with their overall lack of honesty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I work in a media production business and am looking for some advice on our current archival process. 
 Our projects are typically each 0.5 - 2TB in size, totalling up to 20TB per year, contain mostly media files like video, images, audio and project save files, anywhere between a few hundred to a few thousand files per project. 
 Currently, we keep a copy of the project backed up on an office raid server as hot storage.
 As warm storage we .RAR the project into multiple 300GB .rars and store on external drives.
 As cool storage we copy those .RARs to LTO tape. 
 If projects get old, we eventually delete the Hot storage off the server, leaving only the .rar on external drive and lto.
 My worry is the reliance on the .RARs. Whilst I run WinRars archive test after archiving, I still worry about the issue we may face with a corrupt archive wiping out a large part of the project.
 I have started adding a default 3% recovery record.
 The only reason the zipping has been introduced into the pipeline is because apparently LTO does not suit reading/writing data with tons of small files. 
 What do you guys think about this current workflow?

 I really appreciate any input. These discs will be used very heavily. For me the most important factor is reliability. Premier failed disc has resulted in loss of happiness.
 The price is also dropped and for the first time, these seem like they can fit into the budget.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! Hard for me to summarize this, so apologies for block of text. I'll try to bold the more important bits. Thanks in advance.
 I have a 12U Gator rack I won't be using now that I'm selling my DJ equipment, and I want to build a reasonably quiet gaming desktop that's rackmounted. It'll fit nicely with the Furman power conditioner and shelf.
 In case it helps, here's my current PC Part Picker list.
 My problems begin with the rack's depth only being 16.5".
 That makes finding a rackmount chassis that fits difficult enough. So far the best one I've found (15" deep, reasonable price) looks to be here:
 Sliger CX4150a
 I'd love to find some 6U or 8U unit so I could get loads of fans running at low speed to keep it quiet and a bunch of 5.25" bays, but north of 4U appears to be either unicorns, or priced as unicorns. The two other variants of that linked one above ("i" and "e" suffixes) have one or two 5.25" bays, but can't fit a deep power supply like that "a" variant.
 I don't intend to have dozens of drives hooked up daily or anything. I just want three to four 5.25" bays available for 1) a Blu-Ray drive, 2) at least one 3.5" hot-swap bay, and 3) at least one 2.5" hot-swap bay.
 So I'm wondering if it's possible to have a separate case mounted directly above or below the linked one, and run the SATA and power cables to it (plus extra fans, I assume) for these drives?
 This subreddit just introduced me to "JBOD" (funniest acronym ever?), but even with that hint, most of what I'm finding is still into four figures. I'm literally just looking for a 1-2U piece with a handful of 5.25" bays that wouldn't be too difficult to link into from the other piece.
 Anyone have ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to get a new storage solution for what's now about 25 TB of data (mostly video files) with room to grow at several TB per year. We previously had some DROBO units but due to downsizing we got rid of the server they were attached to and the units basically bricked when we tried to update the firmware with the intent of moving and repopulating them. So now that data is just sitting on some external drives until we can get a new system. 
 I was initially looking at something along the lines of a QNAP tr-004 DAS (or similar device) to populate with 16 TB drives (I was looking at Ironwolf Pro) and run in RAID 1 for 32 TB usable space, but I've seen some bad things about them so I'm doubting that plan now, and it would only last a couple more years. I have absolutely no desire to build a NAS from scratch, and am wary of anything that might be locked to a specific device without recovery options if it fails. I'm wondering if I should just get the drives and any old enclosure as opposed to running a RAID at all, then make my own redundant copy? 
 To be clear, this isn't data that we're actively working with. It's archives that we just need to be able to access on occasion. I'm open to suggestions on how to approach this, as my research consistently leaves me with as many questions as answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been trying to bypass Wi-Fi blocks at a place I go to frequently. I have my own server at home or on Azure to run it.
 I've tried OpenVPN and Wireguard (with algo). OpenVPN refuses to connect and Wireguard connects however I cannot search or directly connect to IPs (it does work on other networks.) Another thing I've noticed is that I'm able to connect to my Minecraft server, but not join as it cannot connect to Mojang's authentication servers. I'm not completely sure of how the block works though, since I am unable to connect to any VPNs on that port. Let me also point out, Hotspot Shield's "Hydra" protocol is able to bypass these blocks but I'm not paying for a VPN if I know there is some way out there to bypass these blocks.
 From what I know:
 The network has its own DNS, using Google's or Cloudflare's just results in a "The connection reset" page instead of the block placeholder page. The network also has it's own search domain (on macOS)
 If you have any questions about the requirements, let me know and I'll reply to the best of my ability.

 https://servertailor.com/products/dell-poweredge-r430/
 Is there a limitation of power usage with the riser? i was reading some say 25w limit but maybe that was for x20 series
 I have dual 550w PSUs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All,
 I'd like to add a cloud backup outside my normal routine. I would just like to find somewhere that would let me just upload via FTP. I need a decent amount of space 10tb or so. But I will be uploading about 6tb weekly (I can do bi-weekly if I have to.) This is for some VMs and is just another layer of backup. Obviously need something that can accept data at a good rate, I have 1250mbps up but fine with 500mbps up or so. I'd like to keep it around $100 a month. I'm ok paying something to download, if things go well I would never download. TIA

I would like to create an NGINX Proxy Manager as a container with the same parent interface ovs_bond0 that I created a macvlan from for my AdGuard Home container. 
 Tried creating a macvlan from the same parent interface ovs_bond0 that I used for AdGuard Home:
 sudo docker network create -d macvlan -o parent=ovs_bond0 --subnet=192.168.7.0/24 --gateway=192.168.7.1 --ip-range=192.168.7.253/32 npm_network 
 I get an error after running the command:
 Error response from daemon: failed to allocate gateway (192.168.7.1): Address already in use 
 I am trying to use the network that AdGuard Home (running as a container) is currently using. Here's the output the macvlan I created for AdGuard Home.
 "Name": "adg-home_network", "Created": "2022-11-14T14:58:47.62068652-08:00", "Scope": "local", "Driver": "macvlan", "EnableIPv6": false, "IPAM": { "Driver": "default", "Options": {}, "Config": [ { "Subnet": "192.168.7.0/24", "IPRange": "192.168.7.254/32", "Gateway": "192.168.7.1"
 It seems like Docker does not allow you to create a macvlan with a gateway (192.168.7.1) that is already being used. Can I set this up with the same gateway 192.168.7.1 for the macvlan for NGINX Proxy Manager? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.

 My 2TB 5200RPM Drive its having a long death, so time to find its replacement. 
 Im running a Xeoma Docker instance, connected to around 16 IP Cameras, Resolution 4MP, all H265, each has a data load of around .5 - 2MB/s with my current settings, so a total for all the cameras 30 - 40MB/s. 
 My current WD Golds data transfer average its 180MB/s, so that means a 7200RPM drive can handle a lot of cameras (64 Cameras)... Im thinking my numbers are probably way off. 
 But well, the latest Seagate 2TB its having a premature death, so maybe this setup its a little hard on the HDD's.... or not?. 
 Would it be better to setup an small 512 / 1TB SSD as a cache of the recordings*?, and then send each day to the HDD?. Not sure if a lot of writes are better handled with a Enterprise SSD, or a spinnning one. 
 *For the unfamiliar, Unraid can use SSD's as cache, and a little script called "Mover" can send the data to the HDD at certain intervals, generally each night. 
 Current Setup:
 2TB Seagate, Single Pool Device, BTFRS partition. 
 Requirements: * No need to have parity protection on this data. * Try to not kill the HDD / SSD too fast. * Able to handle future expansion, maybe 20 - 30 cameras in total
 In other subject... -- Are the CCTV HHD Drives any different?. 
 Thanks!

After seeing the post a couple days ago about local cost vs cloud cost I put a power meter on my server and did some math:
 After 1 day, 22 hours, and ~30 minutes I used 2.318 KWh. https://i.imgur.com/NS7udB2.jpg
 So that boils down to 2.318 KWh over 1.9375 days or ~1.2KWh/day
 At my (admittedly low) rate that averages ~10cents/KWh with a high of 12cents/KWh i average ~$45-$55/year on power for my server.

 The hoard is on a Synology serving Nvidia Shields and Kodi. I was using Tiny to scrape the metadata and had Kodi pulling it locally instead of searching the net (faster and organized/renamed the files). 
 I'm open to other ways of doing this that do not involve Plex.

 I wrote some scripts for converting the UTZOO Usenet archive to a Mongo Database.
 Background
 I recently found out about the UTZOO Usenet Archive, a collection of something like two million Usenet posts archived by Henry Spencer from 1981 to 1991. I wanted to play around with the data, so I wrote some Node script to convert the files to a Mongo database. It's a little bit hacky, but it works.
 Getting the data:
 The data was available on the Internet Archive. You could download the data from the UTZOO Usenet Archive page. After legal demands were placed requesting the internet archive to remove the data, the data was removed and replaced with its checksum. Fortunately, some friendly folks on Reddit have preserved the data. You can download the UTZOO archive from …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! 
 I was hoping you lovely folks of /r/selfhosted would be willing to partake in a short (maximum 6 question) survey! TLDR at the bottom
 Context: I was looking at setting up a couple services from scratch a few weeks ago and thought to myself, "I wonder if I can just buy something with it already installed." So I've been looking into it and I personally have not been successful in finding any kind of seller that provides this (self hosting as a service?). I have played around the idea a bit in my head and I am of the belief that there may be a few that would be possible with this method of deployment. 
 Those of you who have went through the pains of starting to self-host for the first time, or those of you that are just busy: Yes or no, please let me know! This survey is completely anonymous. https://forms.gle/bXZSfXjAzoa1FsyS9
 TLDR: I want to know if a "pre-built" device containing requested services is something you would ever consider purchasing over setting it up from scratch yourself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set up a Nginx server and, for one web application, it forwards request to tools/ to a webapp hosted locally on Tomcat (version 9). In the webapp, however, are a couple of javacript scripts and some pngs and the requests for those aren't getting forwarded.
 The Nginx is behind SSL, but is connecting to a Tomcat which is not.
 Here is the relevant config: https://pastebin.com/M12m3qDr
 The domain monkeypower.co.uk is only accessible on my local network. What have I missed? I know I could host these files on the Nginx server and have them served statically, but I'd rather keep them in one place and it's only a couple of files and only being served occasionally on my local network, so ease of config/development seems to me to be mroe important than performance.
 What am I missing?
 Also, I noticed that Caddy is an Nginx alternative - can it do forwarding to Tomcat? Would it be a better option for this kind of thing?

 I'm currently running it with 128gb. 4x 32gb rdimm ddr4 2400T. Looking to add 2x sticks of 128gb optane pmem. Will bring the machine from 128gb ddr4 to 384gb of "Memory Mode" space... 
 #1: I am unclear whether or not ALL DIMM speeds need to match, or can I combine 2x 128gb sticks of pmem100 @ 2666 with 4x sticks of rdimm 2400T? Will the optane pmem dimms clock down or will it just not work? 
 #2: It is my understanding that on this motherboard, optane dimms only works in memory mode. Is that correct? The description says "up to 1tb in memory mode". Can you run less than 1TB in different modes? 
 #3: TPM Modules: I have to buy a SM branded module right? Are there other options or just get the SM part from a known vendor? 
 #4: Anything else I should know?

I have been wanting a server but the cost kept me out of it till I came across this old thing. I have it running and was able to setup proxmox along with various other applications within the VMs I have created. Just this morning I noticed the health and memory lights were blinking on the front of it. I am going to assume that it is a RAM stick that is not seated correctly so I will take it apart and take a look at that. I was just wondering if there is a recommendation for RAM replacement on this thing. I know it has 6 slots available. I would probably just replace all of it. Not 100% familiar with server memory but if this thing has UDIMM in it and I purchased RDIMM then i would have to remove all of the UDIMM sticks correct? Any decent places to pick up some ram?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 This has been bugging me for a while. There are great options for replacing the majority of what music services like Spotify or Apple Music do - Jellyfin, Plex, etc, supported by software like Lidarr and the like, to make it easy to self-host your music library, expand it, access it with ease from anywhere with a plethora of clients etc.
 The one thing that's missing, to my knowledge, is a discoverability/recommendation engine. Features like 'Daily Mix', dynamic playlists that encompass popular songs from a particular category, 'Discover Weekly' etc. These are IME very nice features for discovering new music and expanding your music library.
 Is there something out there that's usable with something like Jellyfin? I know there are tools like Gnoosic and TasteKid but these are external tools that can't really hook into the 'stack' so to speak.

 So I'm currently digitising all my grandma's photos from pictures from the 1950s and 1960s right through to the 2000s and 2010s. I was just wondering how you'd organise them all? (1000+). At the moment I've got a folder for each person, then within that I've got "Group" folder "Solo" folder and "Documents" folder. But when multiple people are in the group photos, having 10/15 copies of one photo seems overkill. There must be a better way to approach this? 
 Would love to see any examples whether it's screenshots or links to a folder set up. Just any help would be much appreciated! Also naming conventions too. Initially I had "Surname, First Name - Event" however, my grandma has 11 siblings so I can't list everyone within that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to get some thoughts on a setup to segregate my network a little bit using my current ASUS ac3100 router. I would use one lan port of the router to plug into a dumb switch that will have my hue station, voip, ps5 and TV connected to it. Another lan port will go into a NIC on my proxmox server that would be used in a virtual OPNsense only as it’s WAN port with another NIC going out of the proxmox box as the OPNsense lan port into a TP-Link 24 port SG1024DE so as to take advantage of VLANs. The only devices that would use this OPNsense router would be my unraid server, the other proxmox VMs and potentially my main gaming machine but that might not work due to double NAT so that may have to go in another way. All my google home devices and other wireless devices would all go through the ASUS wireless as normal but wouldn’t be able to communicate with my servers or potentially my gaming rig if I can figure out the double NAT issue.
 Edit 1: The router can't provide vlans so the vlan side of things would be the lab network and the pieces I don't want a part it would go through the asus router and not the opnsense
 Edit 2: I would love to run opnsense on seperate hardware but I don't really want another machine and I don't want the edge router to be virtualized as it leaves alot of openings for issues when updating and potential vulnerabilities in the hypervisor.
 Edit 3: After some digging and thought process I came up with, that I could just setup a guest wifi network with wpa2 and a key and move all devices that don't need to access the lan for any reason to that guest network probably would be the simpler plan.

 I’m working with my MacBook Pro M1 on a docking station with Final Cunt. The power of the M1 is absolutely sufficient for my workload. But the Storage Capacity isn’t.
 But now there is the noop question. When I have all the data on my new NAS, will I be able to still use the M1 power? Or do I need to build a powerful CPU into my NAS??
 Or differently spoken; where is the Power needed? On the Maschine that is running Final Cut, or on the nas?
 Sorry, I really struggle to build this question in the way I mean it. But I hope my problem becomes clear and someone can help.

 So I want to replace my old PC running esxi with a small intel nuc.
 I just want to have confirmation that it will work.
 Intel NUC NUC10i5FNHN
 https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/214591/intel-nuc-10-performance-kit-nuc10i5fnhn.html
 From what I read, I will need to add the driver for the NIC but the storage controller should work.
 It's the tall version so I should have space to put an SSD 2.5.
 I will add RAM.
 ​
 Do you see any problem?

 thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Ive been looking a bit for an internal Reverse Proxy for my Homelab.
 I do not need any external proxy functionality, since I already use NGINX Proxy Manager for that. I just want an internal proxy.
 I plan on just using something like cluster.lan.local to get to my Proxmox Cluster Webinterface, if the proxy could also load balance the request, in case the first Node being down, that would be perfect.
 I thought about just using keepalived on my nodes and setting a custom DNS entry on my Pihole, but there has to be a better way to do that, right?

 Something that I managed to snag from work since it was going to be recycled otherwise.It was an appliance we use for Control Case. Something that scans our network for stuff. IDK exactly, it is above my pay grade.It all looks to be Supermicro stuff with a sticker on it. All the model numbers had that make. Case, board, PSU, I think the NIC.I am going to use it as a NAS since I was already using a i5-4570k for that and the hardware I picked up looks to be the exact same with server/enterprise bits tacked on. I just need to get a LSI/SAS/HBA card. eBay and y'all say $40ish for that. And a new case. Rack mounted stuff just doesn't work in my place.
 But the hardware mounted inside:
 Supermicro X10SLL-F mobo
 Xeon E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz
 32GiB ECC RAM
 2 port Intel Ethernet card with a model number of AOC-SGP-i2 on it
 2x 2TB Mech SATA HDDs. I think. I didn't pull those out, they didn't have it explicitly written on them, and I am taking a guess from the model number which has a 2000 in the front.
 It boots. I got to a VMWare screen but didn't have any of the passwords. Wonder if they will give them to me. But then I got high, watched the Bolts, and played video games. I will mess with it more during the weekend.
 Added pictures. I thought I added those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A couple of months ago I posted about a project to automate management of firewall rules for Docker containers, whalewall: https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/xgw5cq/whalewall_easily_manage_firewall_rules_for_docker. The positive and constructive response and replies inspired me to keep working on it and release another much more polished version. I originally created whalewall for myself and made it open source in the hope others would also find it useful as well. It's very gratifying to learn that others receive value from something you created, so thanks again to everyone who gave me feedback and use whalewall.
 Probably the most useful addition in this release is the addition of a Docker image, which should make deploying or trying out whalewall much easier. Full changelog is here, please let me know what you think!

 Just curious why that is?

I saw there were some options, including buying a pixel 1... or paying $30/month for google enterprise that has either a 5tb or potentially unlimited space. 
 Two questions - is the latter still a thing, or is it limited to 5tb? If it's limited, wouldn't it just make sense for me to pay for 5tb plan on google one for $20/year (annual)? 
 And second, is there a better option out there? Or am I worrying for nothing and probably won't hit even my 2tb limit anytime soon?
