        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks, this is probably a really basic question, but I have a Hetzner Storage Box (FTP cloud storage) and I would like to download my torrents to directly upload to the cloud. I have a few large torrents I'd like to download that are too big for my computer, and I plan to move them to the cloud anyway, so sending them directly to the cloud would be the best option for me. Is there a tutorial on how to do this? I'd like to use as little third party software as possible, and without paying for a seedbox or something.
 I currently use qbittorent on mac but I also have access to a PC and wouldn't mind switching torrent clients. Thank you!

 I've tested successfully my Plex Server with the Meta Quest 2 app Bigscreen so I can have a theater experience that can be shared with friends, and added a build of the Home Assistant app for the Quest to get diagnostics and use for automations!
 That got me thinking, are there any cool apps you self host that can be useful in VR? Preferably docker containers, if possible! I'm trying to build a mini metaverse for my students and I'm looking for ideas!

 I have thousands of books downloaded and they aren't all named consistently. I'd like to rename all of them by "author-title-year" and group duplicate books together. Some duplicates may be different editions/quality scans so I don't want to delete them right away, so if it's possible to check if they files are exactly the same or not that would also help. also... the files are all stored on an FTP cloud storage right now, if that makes a difference. I have both a Mac and PC available.

Then it dawned me that I frequently access these devices through their web interfaces on my open laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everybody, I am going to transfer about 400 gigs of .MP4 files of my very old Fraps gameplay videos from a 2TB Seagate external hard drive to a 2TB internal hard drive on my Windows 10, but I want to do this in the safest way possible, and to preserve the lifespan/integrity of both drives, and also the files, I just want to make sure everything goes right.
  
To begin, the videos are all in a single folder, I could just simply copy and paste the whole 300 gb folder to the other hard drive, but I am afraid that this will overload either hard drive, or cause issues because of how big it is, so some of my friends told me to do it slowly, like, I am planning to instead transfer 10 gigabytes per minute or something, instead of everything all at the same time, idk, is this a good idea? or no?
 
From the threads about it in here and elsewhere, people say to not drag the files to the other hard drive, but to ctrl+c ctrl+v it, so I will be doing this, also I do not care how long it will take, as long as everything goes right (I think it will take around an hour or so)
 
I know that the external hard drive gets super hot when doing this, should I put a ventilator beside it? cause if so I have that ready, same for the internal hard drive too?
 
I am planning to delete the files from the external hard drive they are in, because they are just uselessly occupying too much space, but I am planning to wait some few days to see if the files are alright on the other hd.
 
 That is all, pretty simple, but I wanted some advice cause I am not too much tech savvy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 My ASUS RT-AC66U has finally started failing after 7 long years of faithful service, so I got to work replacing it with a TP-Link Archer C7 I had lying around.
 The one feature on the ASUS router I really enjoyed was the built-in DDNS server they had running. You chose any domain you wanted and it was registered to <yourdomain>.asuscomm.com. I used this for many years to access my home services and, more recently, to self-host using NPM as my reverse proxy.
 I have Namecheap as my domain registrar and while setting up my Archer C7, I discovered that Namecheap has an article specifically for configuring DD-WRT-powered routers. I was able to follow these instructions successfully, and saw that the WAN IP I have was updated properly in Namecheap's portal, so I know that's working.
 However, I cannot hit any of my services at their appropriate DNS entries. I've already confirmed the ports are forwarded, and used a port checker. I can use <WAN IP>:<PORT> and it works fine, so I know it's an issue with my DNS config, just not sure where.
 Prior to swapping routers, my DNS entries in Namecheap were:
 CNAME record, *, <ASUS DDNS domain name> CNAME record, www, <mydomainname>.com
 My new namecheap records include an A+ Dynamic DNS record, but I'm not sure how to map the entries.
 Appreciate any help with this, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there !
 I'm currently a bit shy about my setup and wont psot any pictures of it now, but i'm planing to do so.
 While I try to get enought courage to do it I'm thinking a lot about getting an actual server or get an upgrade on my current pc, as I don't have absolutely none experience with server hardware I'm kind of excited about it but ... there is always a but, here in Brazil every piece of tech is very expensive right now and used hardware is rarely reliable (a lot of fake and damaged stuff).
 I have a good pc right now, a Ryzen5 5600g + 16gb ram + asrock a320m + rtx3060 + ssd and nvme hd.
 One of my thoughts right now is to repurpose an old Athlon 3000g by upgrading my currently mobo and ram, so i can give this athlon a new place to be with this a320 + 16gb ddr4 2666 and get a new b450m + 16gb ddr4 3200. In the near future the plan is to get a dedicated CUDA gpu fot the atlhon pc.
 Would this pc be a good/viable option to run a 24/7 server runing proxmox ?
 I do have a mini pc (n5095 + 16gbram) running proxmox with a few LXC containers and Hassio on a VM, but I really want to get a way to run a face detection software with gpu processing and maybe a plex server.
 The "lab" includes an old rpi4 runing OMV, whitch I would transfer to the Atlhon pc as well.
 Financially speaking this upgrade would cost me less than a server, a used proliant gen8 can be found here for 600 ~ 1000 USD, a used r720 starts at 1500USD and to get the upgraded pc it would cost me something around 350 ~ 450 USD.
 Considering that regular pcs not always get to work well with 24/7 operation and server kind of are made for it, would you recomend? Does it worth the effort to upgrade the pc or its (much) better to wait more (2023.2 probably) to get a real server?
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any tips and sugestions.

 the main alternatives I've found are snappymail and sogo. sogo looks really nice, but it seems heavy, as it has everything, and I only have 2.5g ram with 1.5 taken up. I also can't find a good docker image for both snappymail and sogo (i use nginx proxy manager to host everything so using docker for everything makes it easier because i can type in the container name in the dashboard, I also don't really know how to get a service on the host into nginx proxy manager)

 I'm looking for a very low powered device to run proxmox and a couple of LXC's (the tailscale subnet router and maybe a backup vpn lxc)...
 It would need to have gigabit ethernet but other than that.. just low power..
 A pi would be perfect but the prices right now are stupid..
 There are plenty of thin clients or tiny pc's out there but i don't know which to buy..
 I'm looking at sub £50 if possible.. (if it's also got Vpro then that would be awesome!)
 If the £50 didn't make it obvious.. i'm in the UK :)

I've got a couple of small SSDs but I have an 8TB HDD that's almost full. I do have an equivalent amount in external and I use those to make back ups, but I want to expand to 12-14TB in my new build. What's really odd is that most recommended PC builds I've been looking at have HDDs with around 2-4TB. It has me thinking that maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Aren't 5-10TB hdd drives cheap? Why so low when today's AAA games are 100gb+ and 4K video sizes are enormous? Should I be data hoarding a smarter way? Let me know before I buy a 14TB HDD for my new build.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ill try to keep this short and easy to grasp what I'm thinking.
 Currently my media is on various 14,16,18TB disk drives. - I don't like how slow it is to wake the drives up and load the content.
 I currently have 12 4TB mx500s. - I was thinking of raid 5 or 6 for parity. 
 HOWEVER - 
 If I take 4 - 4TB MX500s and raid 0 - 16TB - ill gain 4x on read speed on top of the already gain from going from disk to ssd.
 Ill use the spin disks to make backups of each "x4-4TB raid 0" so if I lose a SSD in the raid I can rebuild from the spin disk.
 If I'm paranoid about it I can make two backups ups of the raid 0s just in case if I need to spin up the disk that has been sitting for a year and it fails ill have a backup to that backup.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had such an odd issue.
 I have a 10TB SATA drive I'm trying to get working in a new TrueNAS build. I can't get it to show up when connected to my HBA or directly to the motherboard with a SATA cable. I've tried getting to show up in lsblk on this new host but it just won't seem to.
 The model is WD101EMAZ-11G7DA0, which I don't believe needs the 3.3v mod.
 Here is the Crystal Disk Info: https://imgur.com/a/FCSN460
 I've tried multiple SATA power connectors, as well as multiple breakout cables and SATA data cables and nothing seems to help or make a difference
 The really odd thing is that the disk shows up just fine on the R720XD that I've been using until now as my NAS.
 Is anyone able to provide some insight on something I might be overlooking?

 Ive been labbing for around 7 years now and its grown to the point where I host quite a bit of stuff for friends/family on a semi serious level and have put a decent chunk of money into it, but aside from the bare minimum, ive not done a lot security wise. 
 Just logged into my FTP server and found 18k failed login attempts and that suddenly prompted an oh cock moment. 
 What would be your general tips for security hardening? I dont do anything super stupid (unique passwords for each vm, dont use root for everything, dont have unnecessary ports open, just installed fail2ban) - but I dont take any extra precautions either. 
 Any beginner to intermediate hardening tips?
 Would it be worth paying someone some beer money to do some quick easy pentest stuff?

I really want to like Datacrow, it seems like exactly what I'm looking for, but I can't really find any sort of tutorials/wikis/guides outside of the in-software help menu. Which, while extensive, is difficult for me to read through and doesn't seem to answer a lot of questions.
 If any of you know of a resource that might be of use to me, please share. 
 And if anyone can help me out with my two biggest questions right now, that'd be great: one, is there any kind of dark mode? I've looked through the color/view settings and while I've found some options, the large center fields remain white and it's hurting my eyes. Two, how are individual tags separated? Brackets or something? Because ultimately, that's what I really want from a catalog system, the ability to search and filter by tags and I can't figure out how to separate them so they're usable

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I am a member of a Minecraft archival group that goes by the name of Omniarchive. Our primary focus is to preserve the game's history by archiving missing versions of the game, as well as other content such as screenshot, videos, mods, maps etc. We made a post on this over a year ago but I thought it would be a good idea to renew the appeal.
 We have also relatively recently been featured in numerous articles thanks to our efforts with finding a particularly rare build of the game. Example: https://www.pcgamer.com/minecraft-archivists-have-found-their-holy-grail/
 You can join our Discord server if interested: https://discord.gg/h45wxnE and our website: Omniarchive.net

So I came to ask if there are any free and easy ways to archive large quantities of images somewhere private where I can access them from any device. I'm interested in archiving a ton of art (nothing nsfw FYI) so I can have it all in one place. So is there any site or application I can use to do that for free and conveniently (for example it has to support uploading images en masse so I don't have to upload them one by one)?

 This guide walks you through creating a live chat for your website using a self-hosted app called Chatwoot.
 Deploy Chatwoot to your own machine or sign up for the hosted version
 You will first need to set up your Chatwoot instance. There's a guide on how to self-host in the official docs. If you feel like testing without deploying a self-hosted version, go to the official website and create an account. 
 Configure the website channel
 Go to "Settings", then "Inboxes". After clicking “inbox” then clicking on “Add inbox”, a wizard process will guide you through the steps to set up your website. Click on “Website” and enter your website's details, such as:
  
Website Name
 Website Domain
 Widget Color
 Welcome heading And other data
  
Adding an inbox in Chatwoot
 Selecting the website channel
 Configuring your website
 Set up agents and install the website code
 You can select yourself as an agent to get the messages in your inbox. Then, copy the code and paste it into your website following the instructions. You would usually want to add it to the head or the body tag in your HTML, on the top level of your website structure.
 ​
 Copying the live chat snippet to paste into your website code
 The result
 A website live chat widget that customers can use to contact you directly from your website. With the self-hosted version, data is stored directly on your machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 What anti-spam protection are you using and how it's working for you ?
 My config for Incoming:
 I am using ASSP + 2 x Postfix as in this picture https://sourceforge.net/p/assp/wiki/ASSP_Advanced_Workflow/attachment/mime.png
 For now it's working ok but the internet domain is young so no spam yet.
 Even so, I'm looking also for additional protection since ASSP has only some of the protections mention here at Automated techniques for email administrators: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-spam_techniques
 So I'm looking to add Spamassasin to the "chain" at least for the Checksum-based filtering, Hashcash, e.t.c.
 Anybody tried this combination "chain" ?
 Fot Outgoing:
 For now I have none but I'm looking at PolicyD: https://wiki.policyd.org/
 Do you have other suggestions ?
 P.S. I have activated: DKIM, SPF, DMARK, PTR=banner, SSL/TLS, no open relay and the rest that comes default in ASSP also I found my static public IPv4 in one blacklist from over 100 and remove it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying out many, many different photo setups for my photography hobby but I can't seem to find one that really suits my exact needs. For photos from a phone with photosync, its an easy choice, but for more involved photo editing, it doesn't seem like theres a good solution.
 My biggest need/want is Transferrable metadata
  
I want to be able to move the metadata of files in and out of services so Im not locked into an app. If Photoprism dies tomorrow, I don't want to have to redo all my tagging and rating in Piwigo (for example)
  
Id love to be able to Edit photos in DarkTable/another app, and then have the data populate to a web frontend for viewing. 
 Right now, I use Piwigo and Love the granularity of it, but all of the tagging/album creation is done 'in app', and means that if piwigo goes away, or a new better solution arrives, I have to redo it all again in the new setup.

 I'm looking for something that will get me down to a single app and an f-droid only phone. I've been thinking of running a synapse server, but it still seems like it has a few too many rough edges and requires a fair bit of active monitoring. XMPP wonderfully boring and stable, but I don't know if they're fully featured enough that they wouldn't get in the way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are some types of information that you want to be highly protected, but at the same time easily accessible and easily backed up. For example ssh keys, backup OTP codes, backups of password manager files etc.
 One way is to add all such sensitive information to a folder on the local disk, then move it to an encrypted archive. This offers good protection and is easy to back up, but it is not easy to add new information. I think the better option is an encrypted folder in a self-hosted Seafile installation. Seems to be well-protected and easy to add new information. What do you think about this? Or do you know other self-hosted applications to save such information?

 I was wondering if the old disk still has some value. Is there anything me or someone else can still use this disk for? And could I consider selling the old disk or is it just junk at this point?
 It's a WD RED 8TB (WD80EFZX)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Huge fan of the sub. I'm trying to gain a better understanding of those of you who use a cloud service to hoard, whether you have been grandfathered into an unlimited storage deal or not. 
 1) Wouldn't it be more practical to use an on-prem storage solution? I feel like the cost of a cloud service would eventually hit the point to where simply buying your own storage would become more economical. 
 2) Do you still feel you are in complete control and own your data? It's hard for me to imagine trusting someone else to maintain all of my data for me. 
 3) I am currently visiting outside of the US (my home country) and I use a Synology 1821+ to house about 70TBs of my data. The upload/download times are terrible. How long does it take you to upload or bring your data back down? I understand your internet service will play a large part in this, but it seems like it would take a long time to upload a single 4k REMUX that is >50GB. 
 4) How often are you accessing the data? Is it for archival purposes or are you regularly accessing it? 
 Thanks in advance!

 After a few days, I liked the idea and started to use it, but soon I started to find things that I didn't like so much (no 2FA, no offline...) so I started doing what I always do, looking for its self- hosted alternative.
 Until now I have found Obsidian, Affine and AppFlowy, all of them announce that they are the best alternative for notion. I see them very nice but similar and instead of trying several weeks each of them, I come here to ask your opinions. Which one would you recommend?
 ​
 EDIT: So many options! Now I am even more confused hahaha
 Usually there is two or three best alternatives from proprietary applications...but it seems there is no clear winner with this one.

 Alex here with another update on Immich.
 It is October already, the autumn is here, and I hope you are all enjoying the cool weather before the cold gets here (You see, I have lived in America long enough that the first thing that comes before any conversation is about the weather :P)
 This update includes many QoS improvements for the app. The important one is fixing some critical security bugs. Thanks to Huntr.dev and their researchers for helping with testing and reaching out to notify us of the vulnerability.
 We finally removed the Mapbox dependency. It was used for getting the location's name (city, state, province, country…etc.) of the photos/videos based on encoded GPS information. Immich now has that functionality baked in, so you don't have to worry about any part of…]]></summary>

I plan to expand to (4) 8TB drives soon and had a question. I remember reading somewhere that sometimes the units can have a max they can take for HDD space. Is there any restrictions on this unit that would prevent me from continuing expanding it? As it sits it works entirely fine for my use (Plex Storage). The unit has been upgraded from its 2GB RAM to 4GB.
 Any advice would be helpful thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi-professional video editor here.
 In 2016 I was working on a documentary project that involved a lot of footage. I wanted a secure way to back up all of these assets. After a ton of research I ended up purchasing an mLogic mTape Thunderbolt 2 LTO-6 Ultrium External Tape Drive. This was especially attractive at the time because the Thunderbolt 2 interface promised speed and it worked with my Mac.
 After purchase I filled a total of 14 x 2.5 TB tapes.
 Project finished a few years later. Fortunately I was able to complete all my work without any mishaps.
 A few weeks ago, though, I decided to review my tapes to see if I still needed all of that data.
 4 of the 14 tapes (28%) are unreadable.
 As I said, my work on this project was completed a long time ago and, thankfully, this data is no longer essential.
 However, the experience has left me wondering:
 Is this a typical failure rate for LTO tapes (all high-quality FujiFilm LTO Ultrium 6 Data Cartridges)
  
 I can’t imagine this IS typical - since everything I’ve read about tape backup touts it as the most reliable of all backup systems - but assuming it is, what other possible explanations could account for the failures?
  Is there anything that can be done to salvage the failed tapes?
  
Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll spare a lot of the details on how this works, but the still-long-gist is: Ubuntu home server runs VirtualBox Windows VM. Windows VM runs an application that allows the screen to be casted to the Nintendo Switch. The Windows application connects to the local IP of the Nintendo Switch( in this case, 192.168.230.1) Everything works fine locally. The developer of the application is no longer working on the project and I can't find any contact information. Nobody else has done this before as far as I know. 
 The Switch is listening for a connection on port 2222-2224(3 ports for various things). Locally, awesome. I want to be able to connect to my home servers VM on 5G data, hotels, etc. So I can't port forward my phone data, or a hotels router..I tried running an OpenVPN instance, connecting to it on my switch, so they're on the same network.. but in this case, my Switch is connected to my hotspot, and still doesn't seem to be able to listen on the ports.. Hope this isn't too unrelated, and if it is I'll take it down. If anyone has any ideas, let me know!

 Is there any good way to pack an entire website crawl into a single file?
 I've been crawling with wget, but it bothers me a bit that all the images and js and crap "polutes" my filesystem. I'd like a website to be contained into a single file that could simply be opened in a browser.
 I've found singleFile, which is cool (packs a webpage into only one html file), and has recently added crawling options for entire websites, but in those case the fact that then the browser has to open a 500MB html file slows things down to a crawl understandingly.
 Is there anything that can do that, ie, basically pack an entire crawl into a single file that can easily be opened in a browser (without having to unpack)? Basically a .cbz equivalent but for websites

 so I've saved a lot of posts and only recently found out that there is a limit of 1000 posts until they starting to disappear.
 So I've requested my data at reddit and it seems like all the posts are there but I'm not entirely sure as I'm apparently not a lot over the limit (there are a bit over 1000 saved posts showing up in the data log they sent me)
 So my question: Does anyone else have experiences with this, maybe someone who saved a lot more than 1000 posts, could you recover your saved posts via data request?

 https://github.com/AbdBarho/stable-diffusion-webui-docker
 And installing that seems easy enough the issue is giving the LXC container access to the GPU without giving the container more access than it really requires and setting up the host gpu drivers 
 And if possible I would like a tutorial that does more than nvidia, if running stable diffusion on non-nvidia even is possible at all ?

Unfortunately, despite us paying for storage, this has resulted in OneDrive randomly blocking our account for 24 hours because it seems to think it's some sort of piracy ring. 
 This is some really frustrating downtime, and so I'm on the lookout for a cost effective way for 7 people to have a folder that's about 200GB shared between us all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a 4 disk ZFS raid 10 setup for over 8 years that has been rock solid... 30TB usable storage that's mostly movies/tv shows and more recently I have begun to consider switching my implementation towards reducing power consumption (disk spun up time) since anyone accessing a single plex for 1 or 2 media streams cause all of my 4 disks to be active all the time. 
 UNRAID seems like a good compromise that could help by only keeping the disks with the actual file stored in use that need to be while keeping a parity disk (which seems like it would only be able to tolerate a single disk failure at a time; two data disks failing at once in the array seems like it would be catastrophic for unraid). 
 I'm wondering if anyone has any horror stories or advice to share about this? ZFS has been very very good to me over the years. There is no doubt that I could keep things the same but after awhile it seems like I could be able to use storage tiering (dedicated cache, merged filesystem) with UNRAID plus reducing power consumption by turning down the 24/7 four disk array active most of the time due to some minor I/O activity.
 My workload is primarily Plex media server, NFS/SMB. Going to UNRAID for everything could work; but I could also do a unraid hybrid setup with 2 disks ZFS mirror for my documents and photos while leaving the movies+tv files in other disks (this would increase my hdd count from 4 to 5 though due to parity needs)... a third option (probably very time consuming) is openmediavault + https://github.com/45Drives/autotier + ZFS (on each disk, simply to get the ability to 'zfs send/receive' to backup to another zfs server nightly)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[DISCLAIMER: I am not Cisco savvy. I am just getting a homelab set up so that I can start to study for the CCNA.
 I am trying to SSH in to a Cisco 3850 switch so that I can do configuration changes without going through the console port. I have it working where I can access it on the same vlan as the device I am on, but I want to work on setting it up over a management vlan using the MGMT port on the back of the switch. I have tried a lot of the guides I have found on Google but I am not having any luck on being able to get SSH working through the management port.
 My current setup is this:
 OPNsense router/firewall
 3850 switch
 3560CX switch
 My desktop PC on VLAN 10 (192.168.10.200)
 My laptop on VLAN 10 at home (192.168.10.201) and VLAN 69 while on VPN (10.10.69.4)
 Here is the relevant config I have on the 3850 so far: https://pastebin.com/6zspQaXW
 For OPNsense, I have the 3850 management port in igb0 of the router and Gi1/0/1 trunked in to port igb1 of the router. Right now, the management VLAN 42 is set to pass all traffic as a firewall rule but do plan on restricting it to only SSH and TFTP traffic in the future.
 Is there something I am missing or does someone have anything to add to get this to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a thought I had. I can't decide where I want my cluster to go next.
 I currently have a 4 node k3s cluster on Raspberry Pi 4s. It used to be 3 masters but a recent update screwed up etcd latency so I've had to go down to a dedicated single master.
 I used to run rook ceph for storage. I really liked how it "just worked™" and I could mess with the cluster all day and not worry about data loss. Adding disks was so simple, just plug in a blank disk and it sucks it up. It doesn't natively support arm though so it was hacky and hard to update.
 I moved to Longhorn, but longhorn has a lot of issues. I have to constantly babysit it.
 I want to move to an x86 cluster, ideally with 3 masters and room to expand workers. If each node had a boot dive and space for a secondary drive for rook ceph to use, that would be awesome. There are some good HP, Dell and Lenovo options but I don't know which would be best.
 Everyone's workload is different. What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As of right now, I have approx 600 GB of personal files (documents, pictures, videos, code, etc.). It's not that well organized and I can probably shrink it (a lot) down. But I'm working on that.
 As of right now I have 2x 1tb portable drives (HDD), I keep one of them always with me and once in a month I manually copy/sync the files to the second one.
 I plan on having one plugged into a RPI 24/7 and setup a samba share. Then make a script so that I can plug in the second drive and it will automatically copy everything to it. It sends an email notification when done (so I know when I can disconnect the drive). The drive will be stored offline at my friend's house, so I have to go there and pick it up and bring it back everytime (which is fine for me, I come there regularly).
 To copy everything I'm probably going to use rsync with the -b flag (=incremental backups). One folder containing all the up-to date files. If a file has changed it will move the old file to a folder with the current date as name and update the file in the "up-to date folder" with the new contents. Same for deleting (moving to the current date folder).
 So before running the script:  /backup/files/test content: test1 
 Then change test1 to test2
 After running the script: ``` /backup/2022-10-08/test content: test1
 /backup/files/test content: test2 ```
 Do you have any tips/recommendations?
 Also, should I include cloud storage in my backup plan? Or maybe get a VPS with a lot of storage? I've been avoiding cloud storage since encryption is a must for me.

 I've been processing ArchiveTeam's YouTube discussions dataset into something more workable than the unwieldy raw JSON responses saved from YouTube, and I would like to share it to anyone who's interested in the data. This all started when a reddit user asked if their channel's discussion tab was saved, and I challenged myself into processing this dataset for fun. Here's some code that I wrote for this, if anyone is curious.
 Hopefully someone can find a good use for this dataset!
 The dataset is in newline-delimited JSON, divided by comment year (2006-2021), and compressed with ZSTD. Each line represents a single comment.
 Some fun stats:
  
23.1 GB compressed (97.6 GB uncompressed)
 2.1 TB of compressed WARCs processed (~16 TB uncompressed)
 245.3 million comments
 32.3 million…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a home server that's running a number of different services. Some of them are typical web servers each running in their own Docker container, with nginx delegating web requests to the right server based on subdomain. Others are non-web services running on a specific port. (e.g. OpenVPN, ssh, a game server, etc.)
 What I'd like to do is prioritize each service so that they all get a certain percentage of my total bandwidth, depending on which services are active and using bandwidth. This however includes differentiating between the different web servers and the non-web services, which makes it tricky.
 Here's an example:
  
https​://foo.mydomain.com has a priority of 6
 OpenVPN has a priority of 3
 ssh has a priority of 2
 https​://bar.mydomain.com has a priority of 1
 all uncategorized outgoing traffic (such as normal user web traffic) has a priority of 1
  
...therefore if all four are uploading at once, foo.mydomain.com gets twice the upstream bandwidth as OpenVPN, three times as much bandwidth as ssh, and six times as much as bar.mydomain.com or regular user web traffic.
 Further, if any these services or web servers are being accessed on my LAN, then I don't want there to be any bandwidth limiting at all. ~(So I think that excludes being able to use limit_rate directive in my nginx configuration.)~ edit: Nope, I figured out how to use limit_rate depending on source IP.
 I know this kind of thing can be done at the router level with the right QoS feature, except that kind of QoS is based on what port the traffic is coming through. In the case of web servers, it's all coming through on port 443 so I can't use that to distinguish between them!
 Is there any way to accomplish what I'm trying to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! We're a small triathlon club, and I'm looking for a self-hosted shared calendar where all the members can add their own races/competitions, and any other member can add itself as attender, no need to send any invitation. For example:
 If I've a race in 2 months, I add this race on this shared calendar. Other member has the same race, and go to this shared calendar to add it. When see this race is already created (by me), just add itself as attender. If other member are looking for some race in few weeks/months, and see in a race there is already 2 people, maybe just helps to decide to sign in to this race too (and add itself as attender).
 I tried the Nextcloud calendar, but I think only has attenders if already has been invited. One approach can be every attender just add the name into a comments section, but will be more visual to use the "attenders" section.
 Is there any similar calendar to do this? Maybe something like Eventbrite, but integrated in a self-hosted platform like Nextcloud to manage users...
 Thanks a lot!

 I have only one issue that I couldn't manage to find a solution for even after trying everything. I can access everything locally by using the IP and the port of the service I want as all my devices are on the same network as my server and all my devices work fine I can log in to Nextcloud or HA etc but only one device won't connect. Samsung A73 phone I get an unreachable error. I tried with a Motorola android phone, my pc and an Android tablet they all connect except this A73. I tried everything resting the phone, the router and assigning static IP etc but nothing works the phone connect to the internet fine but not locally not matter what. Any help would be appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 I'm using a self built server running Unraid. I've been spending the day playing around with DNS-filtering. Long story short, I ended up using Technetium DNS server because it allowed me to filter domains and also use DoT (DNS over TLS). However, being the paranoid internet user that I am, I feel the need to test whether the DoT is actually working, but I can't figure out a good way to do it.
 I've tried this tool and I'm a bit confused by the results https://1.1.1.1/help
 When I use DoT with Quad9 it tells me that my DNS requests are not encrypted, but if I instead use Cloudflare's DoT it says everything is working. Since the tool is made by Cloudflare I am wondering whether the results are accurate. I would prefer it if I could use the Quad9 DoT.
 Are there any good (impartial) tools for testing DoT?
 Edit: I realised that it might be good to also include that I've set the Technetium DNS server as my default DNS in my router, so my entire network should be covered by it.

I have an older laptop that I can use as a PXE server to store the ISO files for building the OS's and have a QNAP NAS which I understand can be used as a PXE boot server. What is the most flexible (for example be able to easily update the OS's available when new Windows or Linux versions are available) and easiest to manage for a relative novice to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Hope you have a nice day ahead!
 Anybody here got Seafile in Docker working? 
 I currently have a Seafile instance not Dockerized that works just fine, however I would like to move it to a Docker container.
 I followed the migration doc of Seafile but that does not work.
 By checking the error it tries to connect to MYSQL on localhost which is NOT what I have in the conf file. I think this showed once only.
 I'm guessing it cannot read the conf folder or maybe it's the service URLs in the config that creates the issue?
 I double checked the folder structure and it seems fine. I changed the permissions to root, my user or Seafile which all lead to the same result.
 When doing a curl on the exposed IP and port of Seafile I get a Bad Gateway error from Nginx inside the container.
 Can someone help out? 
 Thanks!

 imagor is a fast, Docker-ready image processing server written in Go.
 imagor uses one of the most efficient image processing library libvips. It is typically 4-8x faster than using the quickest ImageMagick and GraphicsMagick settings.
 imagor v1 now implements libvips streaming for parallel processing pipelines, achieving high network throughput.
 imagor is highly extensible, alongside imagorvideo the imagor video thumbnail extension using ffmpeg C bindings.

 Cherry UI Dark Mode
 Cherry is an open source self-hostable bookmark service
 I've spent several months of my off-work time crafting it. It’s built with SvelteKit and uses SQLite for data store.
 It supports full text search, powered by SQLite fts5. You can also import bookmarks from Pocket, Chrome/Firefox/Safari bookmark export and CSV files.
 It has a simple, and probably quite opinionated, web UI. So It’s probably not for everyone, but I do wish there are people enjoy use it as I do.
 Please give it a try and share your feedbacks. Happy self-hosting!

It's been running without issues until around two weeks ago, when it started abruptly powering off.
 I found that one of the heatsink retainers had broken, so the heatsink tilted up off the CPU.

I'm looking for something more simple. Like Angry IP scanner but is hosted in a server/container that scans the network and lets me know of new devices, keeps an inventory of devices and that's about it. I'd like it to be my system of record for other services like Zabbix.

 ​
 Any advice/recommendations on a good drive to backup to? Any real advantages to desktop or portable? Should I get 2 drives, or 1 drive and cloud storage? I've been eyeing the WD Elements 4TB or desktop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been hoarding for probably close to 2 years now, and even though I've learned a lot in that time I'm still definitely new to this. I started out with a 1TB external drive that I thought would last me forever (oh how naive I was), then a 4TB one, and then I finally got serious with a 4-bay NAS loaded up with 6TB drives in RAID 5. However, I've now gotten to the point where it's just a matter of time before even that is not enough.
 Since this is the first time I'm properly in the situation of having to upgrade four separate drives, I want to make sure I don't screw myself over. What sort of prices do you all consider good, particularly for 8 or 12TB drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[According to this page on the Seagate website, connecting SATA drives to SAS controllers is possible, but not the other way around. That's fine. That's what I want to do.
 I have a mirrored RAIDZ of 18TB SATA drives in my Debian VM, currently using a cheap PCIe SATA controller passed through to the VM in Proxmox. However, this is causing the VM to take literally a full minute and a half to boot, and I don't like that. I have been informed that this is likely due to the VM trying to boot from the SATA controller before it gives up and actually boots from the boot drive, which is strange because the boot drive is given priority in the VM settings.
 Whatever the cause, I was told that a decent LSI HBA like the 9211-8i with a firmware flash into IT mode would solve this problem. Indeed, I was informed that the 9211-8i is the go to card for homelabbers to connect their RAIDs to. Old faithful, if you will. So I bought a 9211-8i that is already flashed to IT mode.
 It is a SAS card, and I cannot seem to physically connect the SATA drives to the card. Is there some adapter I need? Is this actually not possible and the link I posted is bullshit? I have done a bunch of googling and I keep finding people asking about connecting SAS drives to SATA controllers and the odd other article about how SATA drives and SAS controllers are compatible, but nothing about how to actually do it.
 Can someone please shed some light on this for me?
 EDIT: Wrong card.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current setup is a Synology DS1520+ with 4x WD Red Plus 8tb WD80EFBX drives. I was filling up on space, and instead of deleting stuff I didn't need, I got a 5th drive. It was a WD80EFAX 8tb, but from my reading online, it seemed to be the exact same drive as the WD80EFBX, just reporting now as 7200rpm instead of "5400rpm class", plus it was a steal at $110 brand new.
 Well the drive is reporting much slower write speeds than my other 4 drives in my Synology. The reported benchmark speeds of my drives are below. Is this something I should be concerned about when I add it as a SHR drive? I can also return the drive for a full refund, but I would need to find another good deal on a WD Red Plus still... Thanks in advance!
  
WD WD80EFBX #1 - Read IOPS 200, Latency 14.6ms | Write IOPS 774, 1.4ms

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I will be selling my main computer in favour of building a new one next week. There will be a period of time when I will be stuck with my laptop but still need to access my data on my SSD and HDD. 
 I've thought of getting a SATA->USB dock, but I've read some reviews and they mention GPT corruption. 
 My current idea is to shift around the data between the HDD and SSD so that I can get everything I will need for work on the SSD and buy a regular enclosure for it for the time being (and use it as an external drive). While the HDD sits tight until I get a PC.
 Having both drives available would be ideal though.
 What would you guys suggest? The time frame where I will be without a desktop will probably be around 2 to 3 months. What's the cost-effective solution here?

I think it is an incredibly valuable book which I can buy a physical copy of but I think a digital copy would be incredibly valuable. It is out of print and very hard to find! 
 https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=46C0F8FB4D55280A4CFBAE2669AADF8E
 I was wondering if anyone could help point me in the right direction for getting it accurately converted to text. Ideally raw text so I can convert it into a high quality epub.
 I've tried Google Drive to Docs, did not work well at all.
 I've tried tesseract and it was very inaccurate. 
 I've tried Adobe Acrobat pro version and it didn't work much better than tesseract.
 The best result I've gotten was with Abbyy but I was only able to convert like 50 pages and it seems silly to pay $80 for a month of the service to convert a single book...
 Was just wondering if anyone is willing to help me out on this. Maybe there is some preprocessing I am missing? Very new to this.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I have a networked drive (Server: Windows 10 Pro, Client: MacOS Monterey) that is extremely slow (15-20 MB/s R / W) via SMB 3.
 It is running SMB_3.1.1 as verified when I run smbutil statshares on the Mac.
 I have tried multiple fixes unsuccessfully (disabling SMB Signing, among other random recommendations).
 ——————————
 SERVER | Windows 10 Pro
 5900X
 32GB
 PRIMARY STORAGE: 2TB NVME
 NETWORKED STORAGE: WD Black RE 1TB HDD (CrystalDisk = R: 120 MB/s / W: 114 MB/s)
 ​
 CLIENT | MacOS Monterrey
 Macbook Pro 2021
 4TB Onboard NVME
 ​
 ROUTER
 Homehub 4000 (ISP issued but is a their brand new flagship model)
 ​
 CONNECTION
 Wireless (I do not have the means of running a wired connection, even for tests).
 TX / RX (Transmit Rate) on both Server and Client is 1200 Mbps
 I ran iperf, if that helps, with Windows as the server, but I don’t really know how to read it. See results here:
 https://imgur.com/a/jxAKmBf
 ——————————
 I’m thinking of shooting a bullet in the dark and setting up TrueNAS via Hyper-V to see if it solves it, but that would require extra time and effort so I am looking for guidance before I go ahead with it.
 Many thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am shipping my NAS around the world with the rest of my equipment and I want to make sure all the equipment arrives safely. I welcome any suggested changes to this plan.
  
Unraid Server
 Case: Fractal Design Define 7
 Drives: 14 hard drives, 2 SSDs
  
The interior of the case will be filled with those expanded foam packets to support the CPU cooler and other bracketry.
 The Unraid USB drive will be backed up and stored in Google Cloud. The USB drive will be with me in my bag.
 The bottom 4 hard drives are backup drives for the main array in a BTRFS file system which will be removed and carried with me on the plane.
 The questionable part: The remaining 10 drives will be left in the case which will be in the case's original packaging.(Molded foam blocks and all that.) Which will be palletized with the rest of the equipment and shipped by sea for one to two months. So it should be have less direct handling since it will be moved around as part of its pallet.
 I do have a second option of shipping this one computer case box by air as long as it is no more than 35kg. However, it may experience more direct handling by the shipping company.(Kuroneko Yamato)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 I have a few services in my homelab that are reliant upon the apache2 web server.
 There were a few configuration vulnerabilities flagged by my vulnerability scanner with guidance to update the values in httpd.conf ( /etc/apache2/apache2.conf) in the case of ubuntu 20.04 that i'm running
 I made those changes such as modifying the following values
 (Options None) for root directory
 TraceEnable off 
 ServerTokens ProductOnly 
 ServerSignature off 
 LimitRequestline 512 LimitRequestFields 100 LimitRequestFieldsize 1024 LimitRequestBody 102400 
 ​
 I've however stumbled upon some comments since then that modifying these values directly in the apache2.conf file isn't a good practice as that file can occasionally be replaced during a package update and conf.d is preferable. I've also read some conflicting information that the conf.d directory is deprecated
 ​
 ​
 What is currently considered best practice for making persistent config changes such as setting TraceEnable off ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Forgive me if this is a stupid question - I got my start a few years ago on r/homelab but have continued expanding with more drives (currently 8TB WD Red, 8TB WD White, and an 18TB Seagate Exos). 
 Also installed a Dell H310 6Gbps SAS HBA w/ LSI 9211-8i P20 IT (from the Art of Server) since I’d essentially tapped all the SATA ports on my motherboard. 
 I have everything in a Fractal Node 804, since it has so many drive bays. Eventually, I’d like to move to a rack mounted server (as I continue to add), but the Dell/HP servers I see all have caps at like 8TB/drive?
 Is there a different option - or an empty rack chassis that I can install my own CPU/RAM, etc., into? Then I could continue to run OMV and just keep adding drives as necessary?
 New to this (still) and just thinking down the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I self host for fun at home and am familiar with docker VMs and networking. I have a work assignment that MS Project would really help with. I just can't justify the cost. Is there something similar to MS Project that can be self hosted? I looked into Project Libre desktop and it just doesn't have what I've seen in PWA (MS Project Web) before. Having it be accessible on the local network would also allow my assistant to do the updating.
 FWIW I'm more concerned about tracking financial commitments (projects other people are doing that I'm funding) that span multiple years, have preliminary budgets, actuals, etc. I'm not looking for a task management system. There are tons of those.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 i am running a HP ProLiant ML350 G6 with the following specs:
  
1x Intel Xeon X5680, 6 Cores
 4x Micron 4GB (= 16GB total) ECC RAM, 1333Mhz
 3x Seagate Ironwolf 4TB SATA, 256MB Cache
 8x HP 15k 146GB SAS, Hot-Swap 2,5''
 1x SanDisk SSD Plus 240GB (boot drive)
 1x Dell Perc H310, Dual SAS as RAID/HBA
 1x HP SmartArray P410i (integrated)
  
My plan is to use this build as replacement for my former NAS and do some virtualization stuff. So I will try and go for TrueNAS Scale as my OS of choice. But I have a problem setting up my Dell Perc H310.
 My plan is to set up two separate ZFS pools (one with the 4TB drives and one with the 146Gb drives). To achieve this I connected the 4TB drives directly to the Onboard SATA controller of the server. The integrated SAS caddy is wired to the onboard RAID controller (HP SmartArray P410i) which cannot be used in HBA mode to pass the drives to the system in order to use any form of software RAID. So gain access to the drives directly I needed an real HBA to replace this function.
 I ordered an Dell Perc H310, as it is the most common one around here. The setup should be pretty easy compared to other models. But it needs to be flashed into IT-mode manually as mentioned in this guide. As I am struggling with setting up the proper boot drive, because an security feature of my server prevents me from booting of USB drives, I came across a different problem: My server won't boot anything while the HBA is plugged in (any port). The guide told me to wrap some pins with electrical tape to get around this problem, but it won't. The startup screen comes up as normal, but it won't boot my disc or any bootable drive. Across multiple forums people stated that wrapping is key - but I cant figure out what I am doing wrong. As soon as I remove the card from my system everything works fine. 
 Does anyone experienced something similar or is there an tweak in the BIOS or something? I appreciate all answers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there hoarders,
 first of all, I'd like to drop a big THANK YOU. I read the wiki and some posts and it occurred to me that I was, in fact, not backing up everything I got. In the background I'm now in a bit of a frenzy, ripping CDs, DVDs and games (including keys) I only got on optical media. I mean, what if I dropped a dishwasher on that box when my fiance and I move out?
 Speaking of which, right now I'm limited to an old (but entirely fine) external HDD and an S3 Glacier archive I push some things to. My fiance and I want to step up our game. Right now we share our flat with two friends and have little space and no LAN ports or bandwidth to spare. Seriously. Our network topology could only be worse if we managed to jam a loop in there.
 So, we made a plan. And I'd very much appreciate if you could look it over real quick and give some feedback:
  
Buy a couple identical NAS drives and chuck them in external USB cases for now to save space. Subscribe to Backblaze for a cloud backup solution that I won't have to sell my first-born for once the wild hoarding ride goes into overdrive.
 Hoard data separate from one another for now to leave our LAN in its current miserable state.
 Once we move, buy another two NAS drives identical to the ones already present and put them in an actualy NAS system in RAID 1.
 Copy our data to the NAS, wipe the external drives and put them in the NAS.
  
Additionally, pray to bit almighty that our temporary solution doesn't implode. Thank you in advance!
 P.S.: While writing the above, I discovered that my Unreal Tournament 3 disc ate it. Serves me right.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Say a text file initially said "hello" and a few days after the full backup was changed to say "hello world." Does backup software generally store the incremental backup as "hello world" or "world?" The former is easier to implement in programming but wastes disk space. The latter is more space efficient but requires restoring the previous version through all previous incremental backups and then doing a file diff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, 
 I am hoping that someone here can help or point me in the right direction (I know it may not be an exact fit for this sub). I am looking at digitizing my old negatives and slides and need some advice, as although I have been doing a lot of reading up on the subject, I am getting to the point where I am feeling that I am in over my head. This may be a long post.
 First off, I have a range of undeveloped film (35mm, APS, 110, a few old disposables and even a couple of film disks), as well as negatives and slides (Kodachrome).
 MY questions: The general consensus seems to be that the Plustek 8100 and Epson v600 Photo are the minimum requirement for current gen to achieve decent results, my question here is whether this is still accurate as a lot of the information seems to be from many years ago?
 I have looked through a lot of the standalone and flatbed options, and most seem to be 35mm only, however this seems to only be a limitation of the included mounts, with aftermarket mounts available for the likes of the Plustek standalone and Epson flatbeds. I guess I really just wanted to confirm that this is the case, and I am not missing something?
 It also seems that if this is the case, it should be relatively easy to rig something up for film where it would not warrant the cost of buying an adapter, even if only able to scan one image at a time. I cannot seem to find much information on people actually doing this though, so it may not be viable in practice?
 Well, I guess not as many questions as I thought... I suppose I really just want to find some confirmation from those who know about these things that picking up one of the above scanners is what I need. After I have the scans, I am much more confident with digital manipulation in PS/GIMP than I am with getting them digitized in the first place, and I know whatever way I go at this, it is a long-term project.
 Appreciate any input or suggestions!
 ​
 Cheers,
 ​
 A.

 I seriously need to keep track of it all. So what I'm looking for is something like a simple webpage that I can add a list of stuff. Something that looks good and isn't just a load of blue links on a webpage. That also scales to mobile/tablet screens.
 I could set each service up with fancy domain names, but I'd still need a directory of sorts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need help managing over 50,000 photographs. How can I easily go through them?
 My setup: I have a 10Tb external drive I use as a backup. The files are all in the root folder, sorted by Date Taken. (Maybe the photos should not be in the root so that my drive can open before it starts loading them?) The computer I have is over 10 years old with an AMD APU, and it seems to struggle with loading them all. I was given an older SSD which has increased the speed of Windows significantly. I am not at the PC now, but likely have 16Gb of DDR3.
 Is the bottleneck coming from my processor, or possibly the RAM? My mission is to compile all my photos of my cat, and to also get the photos of all the other animals we have had around our home. Viewing large thumbnails would be preferred but due to the quantity of photos it is a very laborious process. I also don't want to stress the external drive too much. (There's not AI that can identify animal photos is there?)
 ​
 Additionally, I am wondering if there is a way to 'label' each photo, i.e. this photo contains photos of my garden and contains a searchable tag of 'garden' or my cat 'lily', or 'wedding', 'raccoons', 'basement', etc.
 If anyone has any ideas I would be interested in hearing them. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My self-hosting journey started about two years ago when I discovered both Kubernetes and this amazing sub. Since then I have hosted many applications on Kubernetes. However I found the process not as easy as it could be and for 6 months I have been working on a tool to facilitate the deployment of applications on a Kubernetes cluster → https://openlizz.com.
 I just released a first version of this tool. I'm already using this tool to manage my own cluster and applications, but it's still at an early stage. In addition, the number of compatible applications is currently limited, but I plan to add more soon. The goal of the project is to make self-hosting on Kubernetes easier and more accessible.
 If you are interested, there are two tutorials that show how it can be use: https://openlizz.com/docs/tutorials.
 As I said, this project is in its early stages and I'm very interested in any feedback, comments, or even maybe contributions.
 GitHub: https://github.com/openlizz/lizz
 Looking forward to discussing in the comments :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current NAS has two pools of two drives, and assuming I don't change the file structure, it's easy to use robocopy and let it skip existing files during backup as both pool and backup drive are the same size.
 When I replace this NAS I'm thinking of using a single pool of drives instead, and let the NAS handle large directories for me.
 What I wonder in this case is, how do you do backups for offline storage?
 The pool size is most likely going to be larger than the backup drives, so as I see it, NAS files might end up on different backup drives, so you'd not be able to skip a lot of files.
 Is there a backup solution that accounts for this, other than cloud storage?

 I'm interested in getting them working with motioneye.
 That is, in fact, done.
 But I was curious about the fact that the chipset changes from all winner, mstar and hi3518.
 I was curious about how easy/hard it would be to 
 1.) Create docker build environments for each chip set, 2.) Unify some builds so that it supports all the different chipsets. 
 I've done a little (poor) work at www.github.com/SimonMcN/yi-hack-Allwinner to try and convert the all winner chipset to hi3518.
 I don't know if this is pointless, at the moment it's an intellectual exercise I'm failing with github actions but if someone can explain how I can identify the correct cross compiler prefix without being able to see the files stem in github I'd appreciate it.

 Over time I do plan to upgrade the memory and storage but this will be more than enough to migrate away from freenas jails and onto a proper hypervisor
 My immediate plans are the following - ESXi w/ vSphere for VM management - Nextcloud - iRedMail - Plex
 Plenty more to come no doubt as I go into the open source rabbit hole :)

 I am looking for a self-hostable vinted "light". I would like to provide it for my family and friends. It should really be a minimal version in which you can place things with a price and someone else can buy it. 
 I was not able to find such a software. Does anybody know some?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The longevity of recordable compact discs (CD-Rs), recordable digital versatile discs (DVD±Rs) and recordable Blu-rays (BD-Rs) is uncertain, leading to a widespread lack of trust by libraries and archives. Research studies, anecdotal information and manufacturers’ literature suggest that the lifetime of recordable optical discs can range from a couple of years to more than 200 years. This Note explores several of the factors that affect whether a disc will fail within a short period or will continue to perform well for many years.

The flapless one has a bit narrower a gap than the flap one though. However the flaps were often causing the drive to get stuck so I just removed them. Isn't anything that's holding a drive in just by the sata connector bad for it? Also do hard drives benefit at all from uasp?

Any help would be much appreciated, I've scoured search engines and similar sites but no luck on finding them even uploaded anywhere else so far.

I added a 3rd NIC on a PCIE 1x card. The way I have it setup right now is the PCIE NIC connects to the cable modem and is the incoming signal for OPNSense. One of the onboard NICs feeds from the OPNSense VM to the LAN, and the 3rd one is the host OS's NIC.
 I have noticed some weirdness with my internet speeds where it will sometimes drop to almost unusable speeds and a reboot of the VM fixes it. 
 Does anybody think it would be beneficial to offload both the OPNSense VMs NICs to an external card such as this: https://www.newegg.com/intel-e1g42et/p/N82E16833106035 ?

 So long story short few years back i went with Google Nest WiFi and it worked great until Google made some changes and took all setting away so i have zero control over this device. I have 3 of them since it is mesh. Now google also did something with their updates that most 2G WiFi connected devices wont connect and i had to reboot google at lest once a day. to fix this issue i added TP-Link 1GB router and i disabled WAN and 5G and kept only 2G which worked but it was having issues. Since everything is 1G i switched and made TP-Link main unit and Google 2nd this setup worked but now my network is extremely slow and i have keep switching wifi on my laptop back and forth.
 Can someone with more brain power assist here please

I want those files to be from something like a static site. I can make the code download from a URL. I would need to host something like a static website to do that.
 I thought about using caddy, but there is no way to protect the webpage. I know i can use authelia to protect the page, but I'm not sure how I'd pass the login credentials through python when trying to download the fike, if it's even possible to do that.
 I'm a real noob at this, just spitballing. Maybe someone understands what I'm trying to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I post this just because I occasionally see these for sale on r/homelabsales and elsewhere I picked one up (maybe a year ago). Searching about it yielded not much info - thanks Datto /s. It mostly just sat there as I procrastinated downsizing my homelab. Finally getting around to setting up the hardware I discovered NVMe is not recognized by the bios but post POST the OS can see it. This means I could install an OS on the nvme drive, but couldn't boot from it. It's nearly identical to the zotac zbox mi522nano (even sharing the same model name) and their updated bios addresses this issue. I was unable to flash the bios via USB/dos or even via windows. I did some searching to see if I could be lazy about it, but why not just try to flash it with the zotac firmware - 'what could possibly go wrong?'
 Happy to say that using the CH341A (w/ 3.3v mod) and neoprogrammer v2.1.0.19 to flash the zotac bios (Version 2K160308) on the GD25B64C chip did in fact work and after removing the stupid glowing Datto logo and covering it (from inside) with black vinyl tape, you'd now never know it was a datto box and best of all NVMe boot works as well as using the mPCIe slot for my coral board.
 TL;DR flashing zotac firmware on datto s3x1 worked for me to boot from nvme drive. I had to use CH341a flasher and neoprogrammer software. Posting just for those who may find themselves searching for this in the future as I couldn't find even datto firmware update (unsurprisingly).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just built a new 3U ATX rack server with the following specs:
 - Gigabyte X570 Pro Wifi
 - Ryzen 3900X
 - 128GB 3200 DDR4
 - 2x2TB Samsung m.2
 - 2x250GB Samsung SSD (OS drive & cache drive for vsan)
 ​
 The goal is to build another one with matching specs and do a 2 node vSAN build with a 3rd witness node but until then this single node can hold all my VMs I need. 
 This issue im running into is I cannot RAID the m.2 without vSAN on the node (due to a limitation of the X570 mobo). I would have to run two 2TB datastores, which would work but want to RAID them and have a single 4TB datastore. Is there an issue with running a single vSAN node for the time being?Im not worried about data risk, I do daily snapshots with the synology. Once I build the 2nd node I can just add it to vcenter and added it to the vSAN cluster. Would this work or am I better off just running two datastores and migrating everything to the 2nd vSAN node when ready then add the 1st node to the cluster.

 Caution [C5] Current Pending Sector Count : 8

 I know it's bad, but is it catastrophic? I've seen people with 100+ Uncorrectable sectors being warned that any moment their disk may break down, is the case the same in my situation?
 I am only asking because I need to last with this disk as my main only for a fev weeks, then I will upgrade from this 1TB HDD to a 1TB NVMe SSD as my main drive - I will use this HDD only as backup storage.
 Also, Power On Hours: 25210 (2 years 320 days 10 hours) ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not 100% sure this is the exact correct sub but, it's still hoarding related.
 So, I've got a TrueNAS VM setup and I was following a guide on setting up the ARRs which involved creating individual media datasets and linking them to their appropriate app. https://schnerring.net/blog/install-qbittorrent-jackett-lidarr-radarr-sonarr-and-plex-inside-truenas-jails/
 That one actually. The problem is, and I'm only just now realizing this, hardlinks don't work properly with that setup, so my 2+tb of media now occupies 4+tb of space and it's still growing.
 Currently I'm running /mnt/NAS/MEDIA/(dataset for respective app according to the guide)
 My question is, is there a way to somehow juggle the files around while I destroy the datasets? Maybe throw everything up to /MEDIA/, create regular corresponding folders, then move it back?
 Also, if I wiped all but the torrent folder, would ARR pick it back up automatically? Or would I have to do an import?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well, since my collections expanded quite substantially over the past year i am nearly out of storage again :/ But this time i am looking for sth that should hopefully last me for the next years. 
 I looked through many cases but most of them are only 24 bay and it feels a bit like wasting space since my rack is also quite full. 
 The case should be:
 - 35+ bays (best would be 48 bay like a Chenbro NR40700)
 - topload for 3.5" bays
 - Standard atx MBs
 - good vibration protection for drives
 - sas 6g (12g would be nice though) backplane
 - ATX Psu would be nice
 - not to loud (fans replaceable) if possible
 - under 1k $ for the case if possible
 So far the only thing that kinda fits this is the Chenbro NR40700 but i havent seen any of them for sale (ebay or reseller / Europe).
 Any recommendations or places where you can still buy those?

 I've been using [Joplin] for some time now. I really like it.
 Nevertheless, I will like to be able to edit folder and files outside Joplin. This means being able to recognize which file is which by having names and folder as well.
 ​
 Do you know any application that is able or resemble to it ? 
 It can be hosted in my server or, as Joplin, be a desktop application that can be linked to my nextcloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got this update (automatically) from the Google Drive macos client which is described here: https://support.google.com/drive/answer/12178485
  
Introduced by Apple in macOS 12.1, File Provider provides native support for accessing cloud-based file systems like Google Drive. Users who stream files will notice slight differences from the previous experience provided by Drive for desktop. 
 [...] 
 To find streaming files: 
  
Open Finder. 
 
On the left, under "Locations," click Google Drive. 
 
 Like before, files are not downloaded until actually used. Files that have not been downloaded yet are marked with a cloud icon. 
 Notes: 
 For advanced use cases (e.g. Terminal), you can find your files under ~/Library/CloudStorage. 
 Items in an application's recent file lists will not open until they are accessed in their new locations through Spotlight search or in Finder. If you have configured applications to explicitly use file paths referencing Drive for desktop’s streaming drive, you will need to manually change these paths to continue accessing them as you did previously. 
 If you previously had configured your content cache to reside on a secondary volume, your content will be moved to the same volume on which your home directory resides.
  
My question is: now the "location" of my GD is named "Google Drive - <email address>" ... is there any way to change this to remove the "Google Drive - " prefix? I find it annoying for various reasons.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for the best (free) option for making Minecraft work outside of my home network and, if possible, with my own domain. 
 I'm currently running a sup'd up Synology DS720+ with docker images serving Minecraft, Plex, and other apps. I have Cloudflared and mydomain.com set up to limit exposure. I understand Cloudflare only handles HTTP traffic, and it does so swimmingly but does not address Minecraft. If possible, I would like to point to minecraft.mydomain.com. I'm only expecting 4-6 concurrent users at most.
 Has anyone done this successfully with a similar setup? If so, I appreciate your guidance!

 I'm looking at older used pcs to start as a base and I'm not really sure what to look for spec and power consumption-wise.
 One i was looking at was 150 for
 I7-9700f CPU
 (2) 2133MHZ DDr 4 
 ASRock B360M/OEM LGA 1151 
 Some Nvidia graphics card 
 The other one I was looking at was for 250
 - Intel Xeon E3 1230 Quad Core CPU
 - 16GB DDR3
 - Gigabyte Z77-DS3H Motherboard
 - GTX 1060 3GB GPU
 - Samsung 840 250GB SSD
 - 1TB Toshiba HDD
 - 430W Thermaltake 80+ Power Supply
 ​
 Is either of these decent?

 I mainly plug in the drive occasionally to just watch whatever I want on command. Not that often though. Probably once or twice a month or less. This is my usage. 
 Right now I have it all stored on an external hard drive (G-Drive) and its held up for about 5 years now. 
 How can I back up my Data to keep it safe for long term storage in case the hard drive fails?
 I heard flash drives have less moving parts so theyre better and that SSDs arent good long term if you don't use them often? Im a noob at this guys please help. What would you do if you were in my situation?
 Much appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm looking for a self hosted help ticket system that would allow the users of my media server to request help. I'm looking for a solution that can connect through OpenID / OIDC or SAML or LDAP (least prefered) so they can use the same account on it. I'm looking for something very simple, just simple text tickets that allow me to answer them. Does it exists ?
 If possible, I would like a solution that is available as a docker image.
 Thanks in advance for your help, have a great day

 Casual Reminder: Self-Hosted Defined
 I have seen an influx of confusion about what does and does not qualify as "self-hosted" as defined by what is and is not allowed in this subreddit. So, let me pull from the link in the sidebar/wiki
  
Self-Hosting, as it pertains to the /r/selfhosted subreddit, is any software that the user who puts said software into place has whole control over the hosting environment either at the Operating System level or at the level where they fully control all data pertinent to the software being hosted, including data related to the func…]]></summary>

 So I think it's finally time to create a dedicate post for my personal project KitchenOwl. I've mentioned it sometimes in comments, but until now have never felt like it was polished enough to make a post about it.
 KitchenOwl is a cross-platform app with a self-hosted backend. Everything is shared between users, be it recipes, shopping lists, or expenses. It tries to suggest recipes you haven't cooked in a while and adapt to the typical order in which you remove items from the grocery list.
 If you're interested take a quick look at page linked above, there you can find some screenshots and a full list of features.
 Why did I create KitchenOwl?
 Me and my roommates always used bring! to keep track of what groceries we needed. Since we also heavily relied on recipes to plan what to cook we wanted to have a common list of recipes and what we needed for them. Bring! only allows to store recipes for yourself and not have a shared list. That's when I looked for self-hosted grocery lists and recipe managers. There where many which I liked like Mealie and Tandoor. But none of them had quite the same capabilities when it came to shopping lists. That's when I decided to just create my own app.
 It started rather basic with just a clone of Bring! but since then I added many many features and functionalities.
 ​
 Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments.

 Before the end of the year, I plan on downloading around and potentially more than 15TB's of Linux distro isos.

With my current internet connection, 15TB's would take a minimum of two months to upload. I am using some seedbox activity an in attempt to upload faster. Seedboxes over a certain TB are not practical cost-wise. The other source will be over Usenet. The usenet process is manual with the use of Newsbin Pro 64.

 It’s probably the power module, I know.
 While we recover from this nightmare that at the very least (and hopefully only) will put us back 10 days behind schedule, I want to know HOW THE F**K this can happen, and how can I avoid this in the future.
 Any advice?

 As a long-time lurker and superfan of this subreddit, just wanted to throw out a huge thanks for all the sage sysadmin advices I’ve gotten here over the years as I’ve built out my movie collection and servers. Respect!
 To that end, I was curious about the group’s opinions about a few things:
 - Most of my films are 1080p RARBG releases, with the audio encoded in AAC.
 - Is AAC a viable codec for maximum compatibility with a range of devices(receivers)?
 - I’ve considered re-encoding / Downloading my media recently.. to (AC3, DD?)
 So that‘s got me wonderin about how folks feel about downloading h265 movies?
 (I’m after direct-play compatibility for a max range of devices above all other priorities)
 Are peeps still waiting to switch, waiting for AV1 Maturity, etc before upgrading their libraries?.

The disk behaves quite "bursty", eg it works good for a short while, then slows down to a halt for a while, and repeats. https://i.imgur.com/OSqOQen.png
 I searched around and only found typical "disable superfetch" and such results. I'm pretty sure it's nothing wrong with my system, I haven't had this problem before with any other drives.
 Here is the information from CrystalDiskInfo, showing caution on "Current Pending Sector Count". Is it probable I got a bad disk, or what should I do next you guys think? Thanks for any ideas!

The one thing I'm not too sure on is my subdomain's DNS record. I think I need to point it to my Public IP, but then after that I don't know what to do. I'm still working on getting my servers/containers/vms up and running, and I'm looking at setting up Nginx Proxy Manager. I've been looking online though my googling skills are terrible and I haven't found much about it so thought I would do a post. Any advice would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am facing a problem with my Nginx config.
 My goal is to have a „utility” server where I can access tools like Umami, Uptime Kuma etc. The preferred way to access Umami Analytics would be via umami.domain.com.
 Expected behaviour should look something like:
 umami.domain.com → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 Current behaviour:
 umami.domain.com → JSON Response (from Nginx Proxy Manager)
 umami.domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 domain.com → localhost:5003 → Service #1
 domain.com:3000 → localhost:3000 → Umami Dashboard
 ​
 ​
 Nginx Config
 ​
 Question:
 How can I route my localhost:3000 port to umami.domain.com without specifying a port in the URL?
 ​
 I understand that this might be an error due to my limited understanding of networking and proxying therefore I would appreciate any recommendations for further reading or a basic introduction to networking
 ​
 Tech stack:
  
Docker
 Umami Analytics
 Nginx Proxy Manager
 NameCheap Domain Name
 Small VPS
  
​
 The JSON response: {"status":"OK","version":{"major":2,"minor":9,"revision":18}}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm not sure I've ever seen a deletion quite like this for a videogame. Such a short amount of time before the game was just completely replaced by it's successor. While it is a relatively new game, it still seems like a huge blow to the games preservation community. Is it even possible that someone could have a copy of Overwatch 1 considering the nature of the game? I think it's a very interesting case, maybe it hasn't had too much effect so far, but I'm interested to see how it affects the future. I just hope this does not set a precedent for other game companies, as this would be a terrible practice to start seeing commonplace.

But none of the archive websites I found would display images or videos, only comments, and reddit video downloaders don't work either, because the video is banned. so at some point, I decided to try The Wayback Machine, and, that actually worked. I saw the video appear like normal, BUT, I couldn't watch it, because it was continuously loading. also, the "save post" and "share" options don't work, so I don't know what to do. If anyone knows how to download or watch these anyway, please tell me!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I am a little new to the world of reverse proxies and, in general, self hosting. In the past I have port forwarded for wireguard and ssh. Just recently, I've managed to setup a free Pbx box and got that all going. Port 443, 80, clearly Ip, and then a udp port range of 10001 to 20000.
 All works but then I thought that it was a little exposing. Nginx proxy manager, vanilla nginx, traefik, not sure it's possible. Standard 443 and 80 is pretty straight forward, however, a port range seemed a little more complex.
 Ssh forwarded through I think is what they call the stream option in nginx. Can that be done in nginx proxy manager too? Reading into it it seems that nginx can do a port range too but I'm just not clear on it.
 Has anyone done this or would be kind enough to offer their two cents?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just purchased a VPS from Ionos (UK, for £1 per month (£1.20 after VAT)). It's 1 cpu core and 512Mb ram. I don't know what I'm going to use it for, but I'm thinking I might host a small site on it.
 With these limited specs is this feasable? Using docker, how many services might this support? The ram sounds really low, especially as my pi4 has 4GB.

 I have OneDrive synced on my PC, and I'm looking for utility to do a scan periodically and copy new files to the share as a second copy.
 Can someone suggest such a utility, or similar ones that I can modify to fit my needs? I haven't done any Win32/C# programming for a long time...
 Personally I've never dealt with real NAS system, and I wonder if this is some basic support from NAS, to run a deamon to monitoring and sync...
 Thanks in advance.

 I have a setup where I send my CCTV image to Doods for people detection, whenever a human is detected I send a notification to my phone with the image. What I want to do is also save this file to a directory, for review purpose, so that i can look back and see how many times there something was detected. 
 What I need is a suggestion for a photogallery that can let me see all these images easily. What i am looking for is something simple, I dont need metadata tagging or AI processing in the gallery, just need something that can scroll through all the images , grouped by time ( per day, per week etc ).
 I already have photoprism as the gellery for my actual photos and its just overkill for this purpose.

 I’d like to keep the files uncompressed so that I can open them and access files whenever I want to but if that’s not an option, does right clicking on a folder and clicking on Compress “Folder Name” work well?

The only issue is that on startup, I get a few POST errors that I can only bypass by pressing enter. Obviously this is not ideal considering I'm not going to have a keyboard or display attached to this PC. Is there any way to disable these messages? I've looked through all the BIOS settings and I didn't find anything, but I know some manufacturers hide settings behind certain keybinds.
 Is it even worth the hassle or would I be better off just buying one of these generic x99 motherboards so I wouldn't have to deal with any of these issues that come with proprietary parts from old prebuilts?

 I am a bit confused as to what the filepath is to my Samba folder. Seems to be /home/ubuntu/share/websites. If anybody has a bright idea I'd love to hear it. I'm probably just doing something stupid but I can't figure it out, and I'm really not sure where else to go for help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an UnRAID server that I used MergerFS to make "shortcuts" as I couldn't make symlinks on UnRAID for some reason.
 This has come to bite me as I'm moving to TrueNAS. 
 I merge many directories this way on boot: 
  /bin/mergerfs -o use_ino,cache.files=partial,dropcacheonclose=true,allow_other,category.create=mfs "/mnt/user/Development/2022/United States Customers" "/mnt/user/Current Projects/USA" 
 If I run the command above before I rsync my data to the new server, all the files will be duplicated on both left and right directories.
 If I don't run the command above before I rsync, I'll have some files in the left side directory, and some in the right side directory. 
 Essentially I want to move/consolidate all files in the original (left side) directory, so I can rsync everything.
 Could anyone please suggest a way to fix this fuck up? Much appreciated. 
 I found mergerfs.consolidate on https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs-tools but I'm not sure of the right syntax or if it's indeed intended to fix this.

 I'm backing up a hard drive to another using Veeam free agent for windows. as a secondary option I'm also syncing the whole hard drive to another using FreeFileSync. so to summarize: 1 hard drive is being backed up onto 2 different hard drives, one being handled by Veeam and the other by FreeFileSync... all on the same PC
 I'm yet to actually use Veeam for recovery (fingers crossed) but what I've noticed is that the Veeam backup is almost twice the size of the source hard drive. Is that normal? if so, why is that?

Because of the 30TBish of storage I require I will be using my University Alumni Google Drive account (Managed by University IT). For my Synology I'm going to use Hyper Backup for encrypted NAS backups. I do also have a stack of external drives that I'm using for my Plex Server. I'd like to get these files uploaded but encrypted for obvious reasons. What's the most recommended Windows application I can use to encrypt and backup? Keep in mind I don't have the storage space to duplicate the files with encryption, so I'd like to either have on-the-fly encryption or an automated "encrypt a file, upload file, delete the locally encrypted file" type of workflow.

 Is it possible to run this without RAID? I need to use it to add SATA ports to my server and can't use RAID since it is going to be pooled with Drivepool anyway.
 If not, what do you recommend to add 4 SATA ports via PCIe? I don't need anything high performance. Just needs to be reliable.

 The things I'd be running on it: A Minecraft server for me and my friend, Pi-Hole, and maybe an unturned server, but it'd never run along with the MC server.
 Current setup: An old HP notebook with 4gb of ram and an AMD E2-7110 APU with AMD Radeon R2 graphics running Arch Linux (only reason I didn't go with something like Debian is I just wanted to learn Arch Linux)
 I really don't expect much from it, and I'm not worried about noise or anything from it, as it's gonna be running from a shelf in my basement that already has a loud freezer right next to it. Would this be a reasonable upgrade?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Title paints a pretty clear picture I reckon. Let me preface this by saying I have shucked about 5 MyBooks with this exact method without it failing me.
 The drive is recognized when I use the included PCB, it was formatted to ExFat, but I read that could be causing the problem so I formatted to NTFS.
 Whenever I try to use it as an internal drive, the whole system doesn't boot. I've blocked the 3.3v. Multiple times with tape and finally with a box cutter. The drive still spins up when it's connected internally, but I don't get past a bios flash.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow homelab professionals.
 This question should be fairly easy for any of you who have a TP-Link sfp/sfp+ switch.
 I've been looking at getting a TP-Link TL-SX3008F but have been holding off for a while as I'm unsure about their SFP+ module support. Being in Canada I would like to get my modules from fs.com as they are cheaper and I don't have to worry about shipping across the border. 
 I would be using single mode fiber with an LC connector 
 Now here is my problem:
 None of the SFP+ modules list a compatibility with TP-Link devices (see here) so I have been unsure if either:
  
They are unable to make it work with TP-Link.
 They are all compatible and TP-Link switches don't care.
 Or TP-Link's SFP+ interface is actually not their own brand and just uses like a generic Cisco or Intel chip so should work with either.
  
I just have not been able to find anything that says TP-Link other then this one on amazon which is still pretty cheap but I'm worried that being rated for 10km I'll end up burning it out on runs shorter then 10ft

 I have a RAID 6 array with 7*4TB Seagate IronWolf drives. One of the drives has a slowly increasing number of "Reallocated_Sector_Ct", currently at just over 1000
 As the drive is under warranty still, I asked Seagate if they would accept an RMA, to which they've told me:
 "in the matter of bad blocks, having bad blocks (also known as sectors) on a drive does not make the drive faulty, over the lifetime of a drive, you may find many thousands of sectors may occur, and these will be re-allocated to other sectors on the drive"
 Am I just being overly cautious?

 I feel that the raid is slow for some scenarios I'm currently planning and I'd like to add a nvme cache disk but seems like mdadm doesn't support that feature.
 I've seen bcachefs and lvm-cache as options but both would require formatting the raid. Having to backup and restore more than 100TB of data would require a very long service downtime and I'd prefer not to.
 Any solution that I'm not aware of that would allow me to add a cache disk woithout having to backup/restore all my data?
 In case there's none what would you do? Zfs ? lvm-cache? bcachefs? other?

 I have a few basic questions that I couldn't find in the wiki or FAQ for those who have time. I am just starting to get into data preservation now that I am starting a family and want to make sure nothing is lost. I am trying to plan out where and how to back up my data in a way that makes sense and this sub has been very helpful.
 For my longer term back-ups, I was planning on buying a couple external HDDs and storing one at my home and one at my office. My plan is to refresh the data on these every 6 months from my working data (local nextcloud server). If I do this, do I need to bother checking the quality of the data to make sure no data has been lost/corrupted? Would best practice to be completely re-write the data to the drives as opposed to updating only deltas to assure no data is lost? Sorry if that is a super basic question. 
 Finally, are there any recommendations for external HDDs to look at? Seems to be a ton of options and its hard to pin-point what is best for my use case. I require <10 TB capacity with relatively infrequent read/writes. The top priority being reliability.
 Thanks in advance!

 I'm trying to get up and running my server with debian 11.
 ​
 The first two, and for the moment, only apps I want to get running are Gitea and OpenProjects.
 I got good and running gitea thanks to this helpful tutorial : https://golb.hplar.ch/2018/06/self-hosted-git-server.html
 The gitea instance is good and running.
 Now I'm trying to get running OpenProjects with Caddy but can seem to get the configuration right for the caddy server. Do you have any configuration hanging somewhere in your room ? 
 I found in the documentation the following
  
function as the web server forwarding to our internal server listening at localhost:6000 by proxying.
  
Hence I did in my caddy configuration : 
 openprojects.siteweb.fr{ reverse_proxy localhost:6000 } 
 But when going to the site it does not work, since the "secure connection failed"
 As a wider question, I'm really struggling with all this servers and redirections and subdomains and where the app is... and I cannot find any good tutorials online to understand how to implement and where to search or write what, I'm open for any good books/videos/tutorials :)

My case can take 4 2.5 inch drives. 6 3.25 drives. And 3 DVD drive bays and a single NVME drive but I’ve got tonne of pcie ports if I wanna expand. My questions is what would be the best capacity drives to file these bays?
 Ideally I want 4 SSD as quick storage for things like editing pictures and videos as well as working software projects. With the 6 hard drives being deep storage as well as games and videos and stuff for the media server. I was also thinking about converting those DVD bays into hard drive bays if possible

File server 
 Media server 
 Remote Retro Gaming server
  
Apart from that, if it can run Onlyoffice and extend to other server apps that would be a bonus.
 I've been reading a lot but the information is all over the place and though I think I can get a NAS running I'm not sure how the rest of the 2 would work or which approach is beginner friendly/quick to execute.
 I've had experience with linux and I can casually use it. I'm unsure about what kind of stack to run. I'd want to have windows installed as sometimes I do get stuff that I need done on it (maybe a remote desktop access as well)
 I would love it if anyone can point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a huge fan of documentaries and last year they dropped a 10 part 'The Center Seat: 55 Years of Star Trek' documentary on a number of services and cable TV. While piracy is common thing better than a 720p rip of this docu series released and in not the best quality. I'm not above buying documentaries I want to keep and re-watch once or twice per year but that usually means buying the DVD or BluRay and ripping that. This... I'm pretty sure won't see a BluRay release. But it is on iTunes at 1080p! But I'm not stupid and I'm not paying for DRM controlled media that only runs through Apple Software.
 So my question is, if I purchased the full 'season' set off iTunes, how could strip out the DRM without re-encoding the video through any lossy process so I could have the docu series to freely rewatch and enjoy for years to come?
 I obviously tried Googling but this is a topic with fairly high SEO for 'handy but scammy retail apps' and I have no idea how to tell the BS from the useful software.

Doesn't even recognizes the drive.

I used rsync with an ssd adapter to pull all the data (a little over 600gb) to my other computer. Is there a GUI utility to checksum every file and tell me what files differ? If not is there a command line utility? I tried teracopy at first but it seems to fail with that many files. I want a GUI utility mostly cause I'm scared shitless of deleting everything and I know some sectors have read problems. I wanna know what files I gotta pull from my back ups and which are fine to keep on my hdd
 Edit: my back up server is at a family members place with a data cap so I'd rather not pull ever file only the ones that are corrupt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Kinda new to home servers, need help configuring things in the best way.
 My setup:
  
An Ubuntu laptop as my server - where all of my containers run.
 Asustor NAS
 Other clients are just my TV/PC.
  
My current setup works great, no issues at all. I just want to make things cleaner and easier for me, and to learn.
 My goal: putting together a DNS server to access stuff locally on my LAN using host names instead of IP/ports.
 Tools I need:
  
DNS server - pihole will be ok?
 reverse proxy - I saw nginx is recommended.
  
I would like everything to be dockerized, as I don't have additional hardware like pi hole, or another server.
 When I run compose-up, I get a default network named after my stack. So the containers are all running in trash network (named after these guides that taught me how to setup plex and *arr apps).
 The only container not in that network is Plex, it's in host mode.
 So my question is about the DNS server. How do I configure Pi Hole to be the main DNS server for my entire home network? Should I run it in host network? will the Ubuntu server become my DNS server technically? Can I configure my ISP router to point to that server's IP?
 Hope I didn't make a mess of my questions.
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically I would like a nice GUI that's web accessible for me to access and download game files to install and play my personally own games. I know GOG Galaxy and Steam do this but only for the games you have purchased through them. 
 I have a ton of old PC games that I have ripped to my storage and really don't want to have to purchase them again, if it's even possible to find them. Right now I have them all stored in TrueNAS, and have the folder shared to Owncloud, which works. But I would like it to manage my games folder like one of the arrs, Plex, Steam style interface. Any suggestions?

 So far I love it :) Before I used Heimdall and then Homer as my dashboard.
 I would love to run some more services in my homelab but unfortunately where I live I can only get maximum 25Mbps DL and 5Mbps UL FTTC connection.
 I am on 5G now as my main broadband and speeds are better (can get up to 600 Mbps DL and 50 Mbps UL) but sometimes they drop drastically for few days. Still far better then slow FTTC.

 P.S - Solution was to use nextcloud apps that has both excalidraw and draw.io integration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This sub gets a new "what do you hoard" thread every week, which this is kind of like - but a more interesting take on it. It's not unreasonable that people here don't exactly want to share their hoard, but if you've uploaded to archive.org, it's meant to be preserved - which presumably means that people should see it. Also, y'all probably have some really insightful responses with stories behind them, rather than the usual linux isos / steam games / movies / porn.
 I'll start:
 On March 4 2019, the Facebook page "I made this page to bully shitty doge pages" (now renamed "I made this page to shitpost about alcohol lmao") ran a series called "Doge Noir". Throughout the entire day, they'd continuously post a bunch of images that all told one overarching story, one at a time. 
 I guess the best comparison would be like a webcomic? But webcomics are usually posted on multiple platforms and have their own website or something. By the time the day was over, if you wanted to revisit this obscure story, you'd have to dig up an ancient Facebook meme page. At least until it got an animated adaptation. 
 You can check out my reupload of Doge Noir here. 
 Is this worth archiving? Well, the whole thing is a whopping 7MB, so I'm not exactly straining their data centers with this. I thought it was pretty entertaining. The ending was funny. Doge is my favorite meme, so maybe I'm biased.

 When we first bought our home in 2014, a huge selling point was that the previous owner had wired the whole house with CAT-6e. He left us a simple router and patch panel mounted to the wall in the outside office.
 Humble beginnings
 After we moved in, I installed my modem, a modest Cisco router, a 24-port Netgear switch, and housed my Plex library on two Netgear ReadyNAS devices. I spend a lot of time organizing and perfecting my media library, so I added a Synology DiskStation NAS with equal storage capacity to run nightly delta backups of anything added to the media library—and all of the NAS's have a 1-disk fault tolerance.
 Everything was housed on wire-rack shelving, with a sma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently helping out my dad who owns a very small company that primarily does work as a utility contractor. Our family has been in the industry since the 80's/90's and because of an abundance of paper files and bad practices it is impossible to find anything you are looking for and slows down daily operations in the office. My dad would like to transition to a completely digital system with my help. After some research I have decided on a paperless filing system using a DMS such as Paperless-ngx or Papermerge self hosted with backups to a cloud based solution. We would only need to access the documents on location but being able to outside wouldn't hurt unless that adds complications. Documents would be everything from invoices, bills, tax records, bank statements, time cards, etc. Essentially anything that doesn't need to be kept in its paper form we would like to convert over.
 I need help deciding on the hardware (NUC, NAS, Old Desktop, etc.), any applications I might want to host and use alongside of the DMS, best backup options (can I just use google drive, onedrive, etc?), and anything else you can think of that might be useful to know starting out.
 If at all possible I would like to be able to run two instances of this solution for two different businesses under the same roof. Ideally the hardware would be powerful enough to allow this and maybe some room for growth. Also while on the topic of going digital there were talks of doing some sort of DocuSign for the second business and if that's something that can be self hosted or at the very least be backed up that would be great. Price is a large consideration, but If it is worth the price in quality of life improvement/time savings I will consider it. 
 Thanks a lot!

 I have two main home servers, one hosting a webserver and the other hosting a Nextcloud server. I have a dynamic IP on my router/from my ISP that I'm using in conjunction with duckdns.org instead of a proper Dynamic DNS service (if that makes any difference). 
 Basically I'd like to be able to access both the webserver & the Nextcloud server externally by simply visiting "<myduckdns>.duckdns.org/websrv" & "<myduckdns>.duckdns.org/nextcloud. Is there a way I could set it up to access my webserver with http & https then have /nextcloud connect my Nextcloud Server? 
 I have a couple of solutions I've come up with myself that solve the issue, but not perfectly for me. I could use different ports of course for both of them, but then I wouldn't be able to access them through normal web browsing without adding the ports. 
 And of course I could move the nextcloud srv to the web server or vica versa, but that wouldn't be ideal for me either.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I lease a small industrial bay that only has ADSL internet currently. Fibre buildout is happening but has been delayed 6 months.
 The building next to mine has cable, and the ISP can offer up to 2Gbit connection off this. Speaking with them, they're saying if the owners agree, they can run a point to point connection from one building to the other. Either wirelessly or just by running a coax cable between the buildings.
 Running the wire is ideal just from a reliability standpoint I think, but I'm not sure the owners and other tenants would love this... Can't dig up the parking lot, and tough to run a wire across the road in the winter when snow removal is happening. Buildings are only 30-40' from each other, could possibly run it from one roof to another.
 Anyway, I'm wondering if point to point wireless is the way to go, and if this is reliable enough to run servers off of. This setup would be temporary until the fibre build is complete, but it still needs to be reliable, or there's no point.
 Was looking at something like this: https://mikrotik.com/product/wireless_wire
 Thanks for any insight!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 After my last post stating issues I've had with NPM, I decided to try out Cloudflare tunnels. Although this is still something I may do, I want to try one more option.
 I was running Nginx Proxy Manager on Windows 11 Pro, and obviously this was not working properly.
 As such, I want to install it on Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS, running on one of my Raspberry Pi's. This Pi will be dedicated to ONLY running Docker with NPM installed, and nothing else.
 The issue: I set up Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS and installed Docker (Which I verified was working), and installed NPM (which stated as running). I then ran "Sudo sfw 80/tcp" & "Sudo sfw 443/tcp", as well as for UDP, and attempted to log into the control panel for NPM on my main desktop. The page did not load. I then opened port 81 as well, and it still did not load.
 I'm at the point I'm asking for help again, as Googling for hours and trying various options has not worked.
 Please help. Thank you all!

 I recently revamped my media server set up and switched from Docker Command to Docker Compose to run my docker containers. Everything is running smoothly except that my Transmission, Jackett, Sonarr, and Radarr web UI's will not load. I find this odd considering my PLEX web UI loads just fine. I have been going through my logs to try and pinpoint exactly where the issue is, but I suppose I'm just having a hard time knowing exactly what it is I am looking for. Is there some type of tool or utility that helps with digging through these logs and narrowing down certain problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on some projects that involve running games and other software on very old operating systems, mainly Windows 3.11-XP. I'd like to be able to host these OSes as VMs on my servers and stream the video, audio, and input to remote clients. Usually people achieve this sort of streaming using Parsec, Steam, or Geforce within the VM. But none of those run on these old OSes, and they shouldn't have network access anyway. Another solution would be to run the old OS inside DOSbox or VMWare Workstation on Windows 10, both of which are designed for high performance local VM interaction, then stream that over Parsec. But this only works well on bare metal. Trying to run this on top of a hypervisor Proxmox [Bare metal] -> Windows 10 [Qemu/KVM] -> Windows 95 [VMWare Workstation] results in nested virtualization, which absolutely trashes the performance of the inner VM on my server hardware. What would be ideal is if the hypervisor could directly handle the streaming of the VMs to remote clients using H.264 instead of VNC or SPICE.
 Does anyone know of a homelab hypervisor solution that is capable of realtime streaming the contents of multiple VMs, without resorting to nested virtualization? I recall finding that VSphere or Citrix had something like this, but cost like $10,000 yearly or some garbage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have
  
TP-link TL-SG1024DE 24-Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch
 TP-link TL-SG3428 24 Port Gigabit Switch, 4 SFP Slots
 TP-link TL-SG108 8-Port 10/100/1000 Gigabit Desktop Switch
 BLADE RackSwitch G8124 24-Port 10Gb rack switch. (No links needed since it basically does as what the description says it does.)
  
I started with the TP with 4 SFP, not understanding that 10Gb was SFTP+. I added the other switch for failover/redundancy, got the desktop switch for either work isolation or home isolation (still have a plan of setting up personal NAS with NextCloud for mobile backup and entertainment deployment for both cellphone and laptops), and planned on using the 10Gb switch to connect my powervaults storage to my other servers. (A mixture of poweredges, sunfires, and a Power7 server of all things equipment.)
 However, I came across these items for a great deal:
  
4 Fortinet FortiSwitch 448D-POE, switch
 Fortinet FortiSwitch 1024D, firewall/vpn + switch
 Fortinet FortiGate 200D, firewall/vpn management node
  
and now I'm wondering what I should do with them. Replace my current switches for these, or sell them for at least twice (probably closer to 3 times) what I paid for them? I still need to buy SPF+ cards for my equipment to take advantage of 10gb BLADE I do have, let alone all the Fortinet stuff (apparently, all 10gb SPF+)
 I'm also afraid I'm not knowledgeable enough to manage these Fortinet equipment. (Currently failing at setting up pfSense through Proxmox on my Dell r320. I stupidly cannot get the internet passed through a virtual linux bridge to my containers and vm. :( )

 I have an Eaton 5P 1500 Battery backup, 3 batteries inside all were replaced, and the unit says its protected, but the display complains that it needs service. 
 About 2 years ago, I know a client that had one of these and I replaced the batteries and did some type of reset with the front panel. Powering it on while holding buttons OR something. I cannot for the life of me find this combination, and my google-fu has failed me dearly.
 Its up and running right now, and I downloaded the Eaton SetUPS program to update the firmware, but of course its telling me it has to be off in order to update the firmware, so I am trying to find some time to do that…
 But Im hoping someone here can maybe help me with knowing the combination I can just use to reset this and move on with life. 
 Anyone?

 Litfibre.com is their site. Looks like a limited roll out in the midlands so far, not sure if they’re piggybacking on BT’s fibre infrastructure. I’d assume so but I thought that network would be supporting symmetric speeds for some time yet. Would be interested if anyone knows more!

 Not sure how to accomplish this or if it's even a good way. I'd like to have the 2x 4TB in the Windows PC to store games and media and such, but in RAID 1 for better read performance and some redundancy. Don't necessarily need the backup to the NAS, but if there is an easy way to do it I would. The NAS is an old PC with a 1Gbps ethernet to PC and entire network.
 I don't know a good way to make a RAID 1 array to do this, as I've heard both good and bad for making the array in windows, in the motherboard uefi/bios or with a hardware card.
 Is there a better use of the drives?
 Would a single 4TB SSD be more reliable and a safer spot for data vs 2x HDD's?
 Please leave suggestions below.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had some downtime thanks to a crappy economy and started sorting through boxes sitting at the shop from customer projects. I found an OpenWRT board that wasn't used and wondered if it would work for TrueNAS. I then wondered if I could piece together a NAS just from the unused and/or broken things in the shop (almost). I did have to buy some DDR4 for the openwrt board and the case, but the rest are odds & ends from other projects. 
 Frankenstein has a 150W 12v psu, a 100W pico ATX psu (just for the control board) and two 12v to 5v DC-DC converters for the SSDs and HDDs. If it's plugged in and the main switch is on, the SSDs have +5v power regardless of the motherboard state so firmware is free to do whatever it does offline. The second switch is for powering the two HDDs and a small fan for the HDDs. Sans HDs, it's whisper quiet.
 The control board is an N6005 at 3.2Ghz, 32GB RAM, 11 SATA ports, one nvme and 4 2.5gbe ports.
 Power is ~21W idle for control board + SSDs, ~32W idle for everything. I only had five free SSDs sitting around, so it's missing a few in the photo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a freenas build that I created in 2017 that I am looking to repurpose from a zfs + vm/jail server to just a vanilla zfs file server. My plan right now would be to upgrade the memory (16gb -> 64gb), replace the drives with 10Tb drives (maybe), and throw into a rack case.
 Is there any reason why I'd want to upgrade the mobo/cpu? The mobo has an onboard sas controller that I am currently using for the drives. Will I run into issues adding more drives with a PCI sas expander? Will using this as plex storage (not the metadata) on another networked machine be an issue for any reason? Thanks!

 Been going round in circles so having to resort to need help... I have Home Assistant running on a Pi with NPM. Have set up three proxy hosts pointing at other points in my network. However, only the "fa" one works. "ha" gives a 400 bad request and "ph" an empty response. All of the internal address/port combinations work. I've tried this internally and externally with same outcome. Have set the logs within HA for NPM to debug, but that doesn't seem to give anything away - can someone point me at where else I can look please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think part of the reason we get involved in this hobby is to not have our data hanging out on other people's servers/available to the public. So, I'm wondering if this is possible.
 Is there a way to set "public" sub domains of my TLD to private? 
 For instance, if I set up a randomsubdomain.example.com is there a way to have that only accessbile behind a password protected TLD?
 I'm picturing, if someone were to try and access randomsubomain.example.com directly they would be send to example.com which has a Welcome message and log in screen. From there, links would be accessible to send the end user to subdomainX.example.com
 I am hoping to use my websites for job applications, and only have them accessible to recruiters/hiring managers as I dont want all my work history publically exposed etc. They're currently accessible directly, but each page is password protected. 
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

 what else can be causing the A2 boot error?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to scrape data from Instagram on Python. Obviously that requires me to login to an Instagram account. But they seem to be detecting them very fast. For example, I will create a brand new Instagram account on an IP I've never used before (in this case, it was at a library). I will then plug in those credentials to my script and run it.
 Once that happens, it usually comes back right away with a `challenge_required` message.
 So I go to the account, login, do the "challenge" (usually a code that is sent to the email affiliated with the account. The email being used is tied to an email address that has never been used on Instagram) and once I enter the code, it usually suspends me right away.
 How does it know? I'm doing all of this on a fresh IP that I've never used before, on an Instagram that I've never used before, which is tied to an email that I've never used.
 Is there a way around this? Is there a "cleaner" way I could do this without them sniffing out the account so quickly?
 What's funny is that when I run the script using my normal, person Instagram that I've had for years, it normally doesn't suspend it. It might ask me to enter a 2FA code, but that's it. I'll then re-run it and it works. I just don't want to keep using that because I don't want to get my real account suspended.

 I went from around 10 false positive notifications a day with eight Ring cameras to around maybe 2 to 3, and my cameras constantly record (what a novel idea, cameras that record constantly! Ring is a step backwards in this regard.), and I record specific events like cars, dogs, bicycles, etc. People detected go straight to my phone through Home Assistant, which is proxied through cloudflared for remote access.
 Seriously, get rid of Ring if you can. It's a privacy nightmare.

 I am using docker and from what i can find, crowdsec can read the logs from containers. The only thing i cant find, is how to write that down.
 the Docs state that you can set the source to docker. That was easy.
 but what about labels > type? i can't find anything what i am supposed to set as type for my containers. i see some examples with syslog but the example from the Docs say:
 source: <source> labels: type: log_type #log_level: <log_level> 
 Is there any list or overview of types somewhere, cause i can't find it. I saw a traefik example that defined type: traefik. but that is pretty much all i could find. which is somewhat limiting to understand what the type could be.
 does that mean i can simply set any type i want? Does anyone know more about this?

Even somewhat semi-newer shows that she may enjoy like MythBusters seem to have evaporated into the digital ether. Any suggestions on where I should poke around to find them besides used/thrift stores or someplace like half price books?

 I have an Ubuntu machine in my home with the local IP 10.0.0.xxx and the public IP [I'm not telling you]. I have a domain registered at example.com and pointing to the public IP, and it's currently able to see my /var/www/html/ contents. Great! I have a little homepage set up and everything.

 How can I access my Docker containers through example.com? For example, while 10.0.0.xxx:5005 takes me to my dashboard, example.com:5005 doesn't. 
 So, uh, help? Please?

 "Dear student,
 WGU has used many Google Workspace for Education products (e.g., Gmail, Google Sheets, Docs, Forms, etc.). The use of these products has been free and unlimited until now. Google recently announced that they are introducing a fee structure for Google Workspace storage which means institutions like WGU will incur charges for using/storing these products beyond a set quota. 
 Due to Google’s policy changes, and to use student tuition responsibly, WGU is instituting a 5 GB storage limit on total storage in Google. Total storage is a combined total of Gmail, Photos, and Google Drive. This same 5 GB storage limit will be placed on Microsoft Office 365 OneDrive accounts. We will begin applying these changes on Tuesday, November 8. 
 📷If you are over 5 GB, you will receive separate communication. If you do not receive a separate communication, no further steps are required. 
 If you would like to check your Google storage usage, you may check it at: drive.google.com. 
 To check your storage, log in to OneDrive, click the Settings icon in the upper-right 📷 > OneDrive Settings > More Settings > Storage Metrics. 
 For questions or further details on this change, please visit the following Student Handbook FAQ: File Storage. 
 Sincerely, 
 Ed Tech Communications
 Western Governors University"

 I use a couple external harddrives to store some videos/movies. I usully like once a week plug that drive into my computer and watch a video directly from it. Is this really bad for the long term health of the drive compared to just copying those video files onto my computer and then watching them? I'm also planning to purchase another larger extrnal harddrive since my current drives are getting older and I need to back them up. I saw some WD drives recommended here. Do those often go on sale since the holiday season is coming up? I wanted to decide if I should buy now or wait a couple months. Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So before we get started here, I just want to point out that I'm only using these SMR drives in environments where self-powered, small footprint drives, for less than the cost of 4TB SSDs are required. Once they've been written to, they're only ever read from thereafter.
 Write performance is obviously the problem I'm running into. It's particularly frustrating building multiple drives. What usually happens is that everything starts out fine, around 90 MB/s but eventually performance falls through the floor once they begin filling up. Writing files at this point gets REALLY slow.. 100 KB/s - 10 MB/s.
 I've seen others mention doing a DD Write of an entire drive to get around the SMRs internal micromanaging. Is it possible to create a 5TB image that I can mount and modify from a larger drive, then DD Write that image to the SMR drive when it's ready? I need to use ext2 partition for my application if that makes a difference.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a 5 year old drive that I just took out of service because it was failing. 16 pending sectors, 11 offline uncorrectable, 6 reallocated sectors. badblocks returned 261 bad sector read errors. It failed SMART long testing (obviously). The thing is toasted.
 I'm not going to trust this drive for anything I care about, but is it useful for things I don't care about?
 For example...
 I could use it for security camera footage in a mirrored ZFS pool to speed up reads. Every now and then it'd fail a read, but I don't care.
 Farm Filecoin internet money?
 Do any of you ever try to get use out of a failing drive?

 Has anyone installed an inverter that can auto switch between solar and mains power? Something in the sub kilowatt scale? Google is failing me at the moment.

 I could buy the same server (or even a Dl380) gen 9.
 Under the same load, will I save power? I tried searching for it, but it's quite hard to make that decision.
 Anybody got any insights?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 Long time lurker here, and thanks to you all, gotten some ideas on my vault build for personal archiving.
 I am here, though, to directly ask for advice before committing to buying the parts for the build.
 I do Youtube, Twitch, and do tutoring as my job, So I want to keep a record of these things, plus all the documentation of pay, income, expenses, scripts, etc. As well as restoration images of my systems and copies of my live boot images for my utility devices.
  
Which Live Boot OS/Firmware should I go with that I can run as a Read Only Live boot for security that would offer the most compatibility and give me SAN and NAS hybrid features for network data access and management?
 I am torn between using Data Disk Archive or a Tape Drive for offloading data for "Deep Storage" to free up space if needed; which should I go with, or should I use both?
 I am looking to go with ZFS for the system, but as a paranoid type, I want to encrypt my data in a way that will play nice with ZFS, is system agnostic, and will not play havoc with the "Deep Storage" I go with. So, which encryption method and/or software should I use the keep the data in the Z-Pools and storage medium secure from unauthorized access, that is brute force resistant?
  
Sorry if I'm asking a lot or if my questions may be dumb of me to ask, but I know that I know very little and mostly select info, so I want to differ to more knowledgable individuals than I so that I can get this right the first time. Again, though, thank you for your time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several self hosted apps and services that notify me about various things such as alerting me of errors, services going down, items of stock become available and just general notifications.
 Currently I'm just using SMTP to send emails to my personal address so I get notifications on my phone, which is fine... but my notifications are growing and I want it a bit more organization and cleaner.
 My thought was to create a private Slack and create channels to group the various notifications. Slack is wildly adapted as a notification channel so software support shouldn't be a problem however I have some concerns about privacy and I'd rather use something I have more control over.
 I know Mattermost is an alternative to Slack but not sure how supported it is in terms of sending automated messages, notifications, other software supporting it.
 Does anyone have any suggestions, or have solutions to similar issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I work for a locally owned ISP and we used to utilize TiVo. Our contract with TiVo ran out and we are phasing them out, they are past end of life so we were going to recycle all the boxes. One of the guys in the warehouse shucked all the drives, some good, some bad, some close to bad. I've got around 80 drives and want to know the best way to use them. 
 I already have an unraid server set up with a 4TB parity drive, but it's pretty much maxed out. I was thinking about buying 2 PCI SATA Cards with 10 SATA conneections each, and then using the onboard sata connectors on a motherboard (which I don't have yet) to run the parity drive along with the cache disks, which I will likely get new 1tb SSD's for. 
 I'm not sure how to mount 20 disks though, I was thinking of having my friend (who does 3D design for a living) design me a tower that could hold them all in place and 3D printing that, but it seems like there should be some sort of off the shelf solution. I don't have a rack and was hoping to use / reuse some old PC cases I have already. Any help is appreciated, thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My wife had a corrupted SD card, and I feel partly responsible for the loss because I had not previously set up a household data management system. Her 256 GB laptop has been sitting at 99% full for months. I decided it was time to make a change. 
 I recently built a new office PC for myself, which left an empty tower (HAF 912, 8GB ram, z77 extreme4 mobo with 8 sata ports) sitting around. I ordered five WD red+ 4TB drives for $70/each, and a new 200 mm Noctua case fan for the front of my HAF 912 to blow over the drives. 
 I wasn't sure whether I would be able to pull it off, but installing TrueNAS, setting up the pool, users, groups, permissions, etc. was all straightforward with the help of youtube. Useful volume is 10.9 TB, set up in Raid Z2. Performance is reasonable - around 90 MB/s over my wireless LAN bridge. For an "all-in" price of ~$400, I'm quite happy with the system. 
 I set up gmail alerts, weekly SMART tests, bi-monthly scrubs, and I have everything set to back up to BackBlaze B2 weekly. 
 Everything seems to be going.... too well. Is this really all that I need to do? I was considering doing some failure testing, i.e. unplugging a drive, and seeing how TrueNAS notifies me. Or unplugging two drives, and trying to manually run a BackBlaze backup to see if it will fail. 
 Big shout-out to the content creators and community for the helpful guides on pulling this off.

 What you need: A computer or Rapsberry pi, maybe an android can work too.

 You can create a ssh tunnel to open the Tailscale connection to LAN network
 Probably this is probably relatively unsafe because you are exposing your tailscale connection on lan, so beware other people connected to your network.
  
I've been looking for a basic way to this for a while and found a relatively simple solution. I'm new to networking so I don't have much knowledge. My problem is that I wanted to access a device that was in a far geographic position (A). For example, 192.168.0.60:5054, however, in location (B) with my Smart Tv, is not possible to install Tailscale. However, I have access to a …]]></summary>

 As a long time data hoarder, I saved it, and every other piece of spam I got until 2006 when the flood became too much and I lost interest.
 So now I'm thinking there might be some spam historian out there who would be interested. I would just publish it but there is the possibility that some personal email made its way into the hoard. Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tried finding the best sub for this and i figured you guys are probably one of the betters to ask. 
 Im running a gaming station, web server, torrent manager, media server etcetc all on the same computer. Everythings run in parallell, mostly to and from one large HDD and i actually sit down and use this computer for personal use as well, mostly not accessing the same HDD other than for some file transfers.
 Running W10.
 I use a program called Netlimiter to monitor and limit/throttle my network usage on a per application level, so i put a ceiling on for example my torrent client to have a maximum upload speed of 500KB/s as to not use up all available bandwidth and ruin it for everything else. (i know many programs gives control of this individually, but not all)
 Im looking for an equivalent but regarding disk I/O. Most of my media is on one large HDD. If this gets indexed, downloaded to, streamed from, unpacked to and library scanned at the same time, it quickly bogs down with 100% disk usage and makes streaming movies locally a buffering, laggy and impossible mess. Kind of defeats the purpose of local streaming.
 Many of the things causing the 100% usage can come at any time or at random, making a movie start buffering and getting stuck halfway through even if everything was fine and the disk wasnt used when the movie started.
 I dont need every process to have access to 100% of the HDDs read-speed at all times whenever the process feels like it. 5% would be enough for a reoccuring library scan and not interrupt my 90%-quota for my mediaserver for example. Netlimiter solves this fantastically in every aspect in terms of my network but i cant seem to find a good solution regarding the disks.
 Any ideas or tips on how to do this?
 TLDR: How to set hard limit on .exe to use max 1MB/s write speed to disk regardless of disks maximum write speed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to repurpose my old 2009 Mac Pro 4,1 as a VMware ESXi 7.0 hypervisor. I want to add some NVMe storage which I can do with a cheap PCIe converter card + a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD 1TB NVMe . The thing is, my Radeon RX 560 2GB card is so large that it is blocking the only other free 16-lane PCIe slot (there are 2 in the machine)....but I have 2 other 4-lane PCIe slots open free and clear.
 So my options are, in order of current preference:
  
Use one of the aforementioned free 4-lane PCIe slots
 Buy a PCIe extender ribbon cable to reach out past the graphics card and have the adapter just sitting lose in the case.
 Re-install the original Nvidia Quadro graphics card (non-metal GPU and much weaker)
  
I don't need GPU passthrough to any VMs so while 3 isn't ideal at all, it is workable. Not sure if a powerful GPU is even really necessary for a type-1 hypervisor at all...?
 My biggest question is:
  
Will I lose throughput / bandwidth by using the 4-lane PCIe slot instead of the 16-lane one?
  
Many thanks in advance.

 I've been dealing with that drive above for hours now trying to figure out if it or my OS is faulty. It only has 950 power on hours and based on some of the smartctl data (see here) it could be screwed. I'm not sure (more used to reading the data on CrystalDiskInfo). It also doesn't help that I got this from an auction and now I'm suspecting they reset the SMART hours somehow. 
 Is this normal for these kinds of drives to have really low hours till failure? Or is this drive just faulty? I also can't confirm if it has been dropped recently (I have some suspicions but nobody around me has come clean yet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I'm considering doing a GPU upgrade in my server and I'm scratching my head, wondering if I should swap my Quadro P400 and P1000 for a single P5000 or 6000. I know the server I have (IBM x3650 m4 w/ redundant 900W PSUs) can handle the power requirement of the P5000, but I am unsure of the P6000. As far as I can tell, the board has 2 x 8 pin GPU power plugs, but I'm not sure if the system would have an issue with it. 
 The reason for the upgrade is because my P1000 is pretty maxed out on its available transcode streams.
 If anyone has tried this, or has another idea that I'm not thinking of, any suggestions would be great.

The light is white (red when something is wrong like misseated or misarranged RAM) when pressed and the fans come on on the CPU cooler, case fan (not actually the case fan but an extra I found for testing), and GPU fan. No display, and no indication of working apart from the fans and the power light. 
 Reseated RAM, CPU, and all connectors. 
 Reapplied thermal paste and checked for bent pins, etc 
 Anyone here have a z440 motherboard, not inside a z440 workstation case, that is working?

I’ve got one system running TrueNAS dedicated and another running Ubuntu server that hosts SearXNG as well as a raspberry pi that runs Plex, PiHole, and Unbound. I’ve got all of this behind pfsense. I’m left with a little 1u pentium 4D(or something) server with 6gb of DDR2 ram. I want to make use of this somehow but I have no idea what to install on it. Any ideas on what I should do? I’m open to all ideas, OR if you think my setup is weird or unbalanced, I’d like some input to improve. Thanks for ideas in advance!!

 I was wondering if cutting the wire is some kind of industry convention indicating the PDU is broken or something?
 Is replacing the cable actually difficult and I am just being naive? Has anybody done it? Anything to be careful of?
 I hope this is the right place to ask and thank you.

 I can view the files fine on the VPS but I can only see the encrypted version on Goodsync and it will not accept the password from my rclone.conf file. For some reason in the rclone.conf file it shows password and password 2 (I have tried both)
 1, is there a way to do this?
 2, why are there 2 passwords in the rclone.conf file?
 TIA!

 Anyone know where to check HGST? Do they even still brand them as HGST? If not them I guess that one is no longer needed. I've also seen some software for such things (ex Lansweeper) but I'm looking for something simpler. I've only seem software meant for businesses or it is more of an asset management system, which is way overkill for what I need. I'm open to suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit non-standard this, help and advice appreciated.
 I was a very happy ownCloud user until I moved my data to a home server, at which point the client wouldn't work any more; it doesn't like network shares and won't allow them to be configured. There are workarounds, like installing an old version of the client and then upgrading, but I don't like workarounds, it's only a matter of time before they stop working completely.
 So I switched to Seafile, which seemed to work, but that actually stops syncing after a while too, I assume the problem comes down to file notifications across Samba or summat.
 I'm currently looking at switching to a hybrid approach, using Syncthing to sync my files up to my VPS, with FileRun on top to handle sharing and browsing. I'd do that on both sites, so I have an interface on both sites if I need it / in case of emergency. However I'd prefer to have the server as the master if possible. So before I make the big switch, are there any other options?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The features I'm looking for that is currently offered by Boomerang for Gmail are:
  
Email reminders if an email has not been responded back to for X number of days
 Send out my email only if an email has not been responded back to for X number of days
 Insert my availability for meetings and an easy way for the email recipient to book a time with me based on those availabilities
 All of these in a Chrome or Firefox extension that adds these features directly onto the Gmail interface
  
I know Gmail has some of these features built in but they're either hidden away via extra clicks (instead of just showing those features outright) or they suck. 
 Screenshots here
 Does such a thing exists for selfhosting?

 Similarly, it shows up in Disk Management but nothing can be done there earlier. I've googled around with no luck. Sorry if this is a common question here.
 It's a 4TB WD Green
 Edit: Nothing important on this hard disk as far as I know, so it's ok if there's a solution that nukes everything inside, as a last resort

 It's a simple tool to export your website's "vital" metrics from Plausible Analytics to Prometheus, so you can get a quick overview on how your website is doing in Grafana.
 I've been running it for about two weeks now and it seems to work great! Here's a screenshot of one of my Grafana dashboards (for riesinger.dev):

 I'm very open to suggestions and feedback, as well as contributions!
 ​
 The code is quite unorganized still, I'll hopefully find some time to clean it up, but you know the drill: Make it work; make it right; make it fast 😉

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what you're thinking.
 "You probably deleted it by mistake."
 "You probably never saved it to your cloud, but you thought you did."
 "Maybe you downloaded a flagged file and Google deleted it without notifying you."
 I can assure you, I double check everything before emptying my trash to make sure nothing important is getting accidentally deleted.
 I can also assure you that I'm 100% sure I've uploaded these files because they were mounted using rclone recently.
 So the only possible explanation is that Google is deleting files without notifying their users, which is stated nowhere in their terms of use.
 This Mashable article states that Google will delete your files for account inactivity, but that shouldn't apply to me because I use my gdrive almost every day.
 So what's the possible explanation for this?
 Edit
 For anyone thinking it's a sync issues, I don't sync my files with the official Drive app. I upload them and that's it. If I want to access them on my PC, I just mount gdrive with rclone, then unmount when I'm finished. I don't continually sync my files.
 There has to be another explanation for these files disappearing.

 I am OK with fronting a VPS instead, but my understanding is that many (most?) VPS providers ip blocks have the same issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks. Been trying to set up my raspberry pi cluster for a few weeks. Learned a lot, but still not there. After failing at a few tutorials that turned out to be too outdated, I’ve got the hang of setting up basics of a K3s cluster.
 I tend to run into issues with cert managers, DNS etc. I’m currently running K3s + MetalLB + Traefik + Cert Manager. I’m currently trying to install Rancher (in order to have dashboard plus easy install of Longhorn for storage), but came to a stall when I have to “Set the hostname to the DNS name you pointed at your load balancer” here. I’ve read good things about Tailscale as an alternative.
 In the end I want a cluster with home media capabilities (maybe Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr etc) available at my local IP or even better my_cool_ip.dev. Next step would be adding more apps like Bitwarden at my_cool_ip.dev/vault. I have a 3 node RPi cluster that I think I can do some cool stuff with if I can figure out ingress, certs, load balancing and IPs. Any tips would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am rapidly outrunning my current storage solution, and will have to build something new very soon. I am looking to build a system to serve primarily as a NAS, but also to handle some other services, so that I don't have to keep my desktop running day and night.
 My general requirements for the system are:
 + It should be able to run the operating system of my choice
 - This eliminates most pre-built NAS solutions (Synology, Drobo, etc.)
 + It should support at least 5 drives (I want to run 5x 8TB drives in either RAIDZ1 or RAIDZ2) + It should be expandable in future
 + It should consume as little power as possible
 The solution that I have come up with is to use a mini PC connected to a hard drive enclosure. The mini PC would run the NAS software and run ZFS on the connected drives. + The mini PC: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PBK35VD + The drive enclosure: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Y4F5SCK + The drives: 5x https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09QQX27GM
 Does this solution make sense, or have I made a mistake somewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright so I'm sure this topic has been discussed countless times, yet from my searching a few things still aren't clear to me, and I'm sure this same confusion exists for others as well.
 First, let me briefly establish what I do know. According to the internet, greedy companies have got copyright laws in the weird position where backing up your physical discs is legal in concept but not in practice, because you're not allowed to break the encryption on the blu-ray discs.
 Most people ripping blu-rays out there seem to be trying to break this encryption so they can make the blu-rays "DRM free" and save it as a regular file. I hate DRM as much as the next guy, but my primary purpose is to digitize my blu-rays for convenience of use and safety from natural disasters.
 So my thought is simple: Why not just avoid breaking the encryption? Is there some technical reason why you can simply copy the data on a blu-ray as-is into an ISO or something and just load that up digitally on the drive (like inserting the disc) whenever you want to watch it? Or is that not how it works? I don't understand how an encryption technique could prevent you from simply copying the data as-is into an ISO and then just treat it like a "regular" blu-ray disc?
 And if you can do this, then doesn't it partially negate the whole purpose of the encryption anyways? I mean, it isn't like someone couldn't just copy an ISO file just like any other regular video file.
 Can someone clear up why "breaking the encryption" seems to be so unavoidable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, so I got into self hosting recently by setting up a raspberry pi with an external harddrive as NAS with Open Media Vault and the hobby kinda catched me so I would like to expand a little bit by getting some small server hardware that has more capabilities than a pi. What would be your reccomendations for taking the 'next step'? Is there common server hardware that is sold used on ebay often for a good price? I would like something like a low power consumption server having at least 16GB of ram and a fairly strong cpu, powerful enough to run some docker containers at the same time, ideally maybe even a game server as container. It would be perfect if it could be upgraded easily by adding some more ram and maybe even switching out the cpu to a more powerful model at some point. Regarding the price I'm ready to spend up to 300-400$ excluding harddrives, if that would be sufficient? Thanks for your recommendations.

 When I tried to change the settings using portainer it still uses the volume and not the pre-existing database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to expose Nextcloud to the internet. For sensitive services I always like to have two layers of authentication/protection. 
 When I configured a Tautulli instance there was an option in the official app configuration to pass HTTP authentication credentials to my nginx proxy manager instance. 
 I think this is great because now Tautulli is behind nginx HTTP authentication and a Tautulli authentication portal after that. But the great thing is that the HTTP authentication was configured once on setup and users don't have to deal with it again.
 I would like something similar for Nextcloud. Currently, the apps don't expect an HTTP authentication portal before the Nextcloud instance so the client apps break. Ideally, it should be a one time setup so that the user really only authenticates with Nextcloud going forward after the initial configuration.
 I do not want to use a VPN because it is not as user friendly, it gives people access to my devices and you can only reliably run a single VPN at a time so I would not be able to use a VPN provider at the same time.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I currently have a Synology NAS and have enjoyed running a few apps such as Pi-Hole and BitWarden server using docker. I have been super impressed with how efficient these apps run. However, I am starting to bog down my Synology and would like to start using my Intel Mac mini for some contained apps. Its a high spec machine for being a Mac mini (i7, 16gb ram). I understand I could purchase another machine that runs solely linux, but for my current situation, I've got to use what I have currently.
 My issue is that I need something that is efficient but also not extraordinarily complicated. I am currently running a headless Windows 10 VM via parallels to run a Sonarr/QBit setup that has a PIA killswitch. But this is pretty inefficient and uses a bit more resource from the machine than it should for what I'm trying to accomplish. I have tried an Ubuntu VM, and the resource use is similar. I am also using the machine for Plex transcodes and it is a home machine for my family and I to use for basic schoolwork and web browsing tasks. I have read some on the Apple Hypervisor for VM's. But most of my research comes up with M1 forums which aren't helpful for my Intel machine. I am not opposed to using docker on the Mac, but most of what I've read says that it's super inefficient and not worth using. Maybe it's changed in recent, I'm not sure.
 Hoping someone that has some better knowledge about how container/VM apps work might be able to suggest something that would better fit my needs than what I have currently. Thanks!

 I've been wanting to learn rust for a while, and I had this project Idea I wanted to try. So here it is:
 https://github.com/dorianim/money-balancer
 It is a super simple web app and PWA which makes it easy to manage debts in a group of people, for example on a group trip. You just enter who paid how much, and it calculates who owes what to whom.
 It's kind of basic right now, but maybe it's helpful to someone :)

 Since it was brought up a few times in the comments: This project is similar to the commercial app "Splitwise", but not as feature-complete (yet).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I shared this post in a few developer communities like Hacker News and it was well received. Over the past few years I've been working on an open source project called Micro, an API first development platform and I'm now sharing Micro Services, a catalog of reusable real world Micro services.
 Most of what's here was built with the goal of offering a cloud service to developers but it is something that is entirely self hostable and actually an avenue I'd like to personally explore more. I've always taken a local first approach to development and Micro + Micro Services can be run locally. 
 A few years ago I was experimenting with running Micro on a Raspberry Pi and even offering some sort of official image. Longer term I'd like to build in a UI for querying services and a secure network. 
 Predominantly the goal of the project is to create a set of services that can be an open alternative to what exists already. Currently we offload a lot to the cloud and provide a single unified querying layer but if more could be built into each service they could truly be a self hosted alternative. 
 Would love to get some feedback on how this could become a defacto self hosted solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the need of building an NVR server for home surveillance and I kinda settled in getting an dell poweredge R2xx and installing the DVR software there.
 Would the R2xx (probably R200, R210 or R220) be a good candidate for the job?
 And which DVR OS/software do you guys use or recommend??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just set up my first home server running Debian Bullseye.
 I'd like the server to hold my movies and music, but I care much more about music functionality than bells and whistles on movies and videos.
 Most important to me would be that whatever setup I go with, it acknowledges my star ratings and date that I last played it. I also want to be able to give new star ratings when I get more music.
 The last time I had a good self-hosted music setup was when my ipod classic still worked. I occasionally synced my ipod with itunes on a Windows machine via USB.
 I tried out Jellyfin, but their android app for playing music is too buggy, and there's no way to assign star ratings or make smart playlists.
 I'm thinking of giving Kodi a shot, and hope that maybe there's a plug-in or something that will let me give star ratings and keep track of play counts and date last played, the way itunes used to.
 Background:
 The server is running Debian, and the Kodi docs warn of extra complications with Kodi and Debian. I'm not sure if I should worry about that or if it won't matter because the clients aren't on Debian.
 The clients will either be Android-based devices, or some flavor of Ubuntu.
 Questions:
  
Should I go with a different back end for the server, or use the one built into Kodi?
 Should I forget about Kodi and look at some other client/server combination?
  
I will be adding movies, photos, and home videos to the server, but satisfying my music library needs is most important.
 There are so many options and combinations that I'm just hoping to get some general direction.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope this is ok to post, but I could use some help. 
 My home is 3 stories, and I want to set up a solid wireless network that is as hidden as possible (read: high WAF). I’ve got an Amplifi HD, but I’m not thrilled with the coverage and speed. 
 I see locations where I can run Ethernet to all three floors, and would ideally like to use PoE AP’s so that I can hide AP’s in closets without running power, but am open to non PoE options. 
 I imagine that ceiling mount throws coverage mostly down for one room, so would that not work with one AP per floor?
 I’m also seeing that some consumer mesh networks automatically adjust coverage to prevent crosstalk and am not sure if more enterprise / prosumer solutions rely on the installer to map coverage to prevent crosstalk?
 Finally, while I do have a technical background, I prefer not to tinker with tech at home (fully realize I may be asking in the wrong subreddit here, but am hoping you all may know of solutions).
 Any help and advice greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 Before I start - I just want to say I didn't setup my homelab in the hopes of ever making money of it. I just recently thought it would be cool to repurpose some of my idle hardware to host some services for people, as a hobby / sidegig.
 ​
 Anyways, as the title suggests, do any of you generate revenue from your homelab? and if so, how? I wouldn't consider my current setup highend, and the majority of it consists of 12th gen dell and 8th gen HP servers. (Upgraded to highest end configs), however, I have a 1 gigbit internet connection, with ALL of AT&T's stock gear bypassed (ONT and Modem / router combo), pfsense, and a decent UPS combo, so in the uptime / reliability department, I think I'm (partially covered). No ATT gear to go bad, and a battery backup in the event of a power outage. 
 I was personally thinking of hosting dedicated game servers, the issue is competing with the flexibility, price, and uptime with current solutions. I would love to market towards setting up and old game servers that aren't officially supported (Games that had their source code leaked, like War Inc, WarZ, and pretty much anything on ragezone), but I'm not sure if it's a good idea, or if there's better solutions for a side gig.

 anyway, i like putting stuff in archives. dealing with tons of files its been helpful to keep stuff tidy and organized. i see that i can do recovery volumes in winrar when building my archives which from what i can gather work like par files. i wondered from anybody who has experience with this stuff if it is better to stick to a program like multipar or if this winrar feature is legit and these .rev files could help rebuild an archive in the event of corruption?
 thanks for any help on the subject

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am slowly getting into self hosting. I have made a TrueNAS SCALE machine that, so far, just serves as a media server. I use, and have used, Plex heavily for years, movies and shows only.
 I am getting into organizing and serving other media I use less frequently:
  
Photos, Images
 Audiobooks
 Podcasts
 Comic books
  
I'm ready to tackle the next content on my list: photos & images. I frequently see two self-hosted solutions recommended here: Photoprism and Plex photos to a lesser extent. 
 I recall a couple years ago Plex ended the phone auto-upload capability, which fed into its Photo libraries. However, I see nextcloud+plex recommended as a means to sync photos from phones to plex. I like plex's built-in abilities to serve content outside of my local network. On the other hand, should I be concerned that plex will pull the plug on the photos feature completely?
 Photoprism seems to have some extra capabilities such as feature/face recognition. The UI is unfamiliar at the moment though.
 I definitely want to use something with a native docker build in the truenas scale "app" libraries to keep things simple. I think I would like to, at a minimum, separate my libraries into photos and images (for things like digital art).
 Which approach would be best for a self hosting beginner with the above needs? Anything obvious I'm not considering? How big a deal is putting another "egg in the basket" by relying on Plex to handle another media type vs. diversifying into other applications?

Would a HDD or a SDD be better for me with. Will there be any data loss if im not using them for long period of time after filling it up as I only need it as a back up storage.
 When I look at HDD I see the External drives like the Western Digital Easystore or Mybook. What would be the difference in one of those type of externals and just getting a hard drive and putting it into an enclosure?

 I have small server running raid 10 (4-6tb drives) . the other day I lost everything in a particular drive until i used the windows error checking tool and it all showed back up.
 well now the whole thing says i need to format the drive, which is the whole raid server.
 individually when i take the drives out they all show up except for drive 1 which says it needs to format.
 ​
 is it just a bad drive? ive had bad drives before and they of course repopulate when a new one is inserted, will this work?

 I stumbled across grocy in this sub when looking for a solution to build a shared shopping list. While complete ERP seems overkill to me, I like the idea of automating the list. So it is installed and 60+ products in the database. 😂 However one aspect still bothers me: How do you manage one time items? E.g. a shop having a limited offer for clothing or tech? It would increase the wife acceptance factor by a lot if these items could also easiliy put on the shopping list.
 Cheers!

Last night I added the new disk and let it resilver overnight, but it did bother me that in smartctl it has (SMR) in the name.
 So today after searching about it I found all this info about how bad the SMR disks are for raid and especially bad for raidz, this one article says it took them 9 days to resilver a 4TB Red, and i'm here confused because it only took 8hrs for my raidz2 (56% full) zpool, so I have to ask if they are that bad? should I avoid them if possible in the future?

 I've noticed that with AM5, that if you want 8x sata ports, you need to buy 670e. However most of those only come with 2 x16 PCI 5 slots. Since I know some of you use some sort of Sata controller (probably either in a x1 or the x16 (4x) slot), how many would still upgrade, if you had to use the controller in the 2nd x16 slot (thus both now run at 8/8).

 I was using Onedrive for this. A python script used to copy the files into the onedrive subfolder, and I had enabled share on the folder and sent the link. That was when I was using my windows PC.
 I've since transitioned to a VM on Digital Ocean, and to use the Onedrive APIs I need to pay for a subscription and start an Azure account which I really don't want to do.
 Is there any free or self hosted option to achieve this?
 Thanks a lot!

 Looking to build a DIY nas to replace aging QNAP.
 Will be used as file server and backup. However, I also want to be able to spin up docker containers for OS, CI/CD self hosted agents, VS Code server etc.
 I’m a little confused and unsure if possible/how I can have TrueNAS setup for file serving, and have these home lab virtualisation flexibility, how I might split the storage pool to accommodate files and VMs, whether, with TrueNAS as OS I will still have access to the CLI to do docker builds etc?
 I feel I’m missing some basic understanding on how such requirements might be set up on a home lab.
 Grateful for any clarity!

 I want to replace my 10 year old Qnap TS-212p NAS. In the past, I used to have the webGUI exposed to the internet, but because a lot of vulnerabilities were discovered, I disabled this.
 A couple of friends used the webGUI to save photo's to my NAS and I also used it a lot for link file sharing. This was my preferred way to share files over 30MB+. I can also use different internet services, but this is r/selfhosted :D
 I preferably don't want to expose the webGUI anymore, but I do want to share files via this NAS. I think a Synology would be the best option when I want to do this. Is there a something I'm missing as a potential option to share (and upload) files securely from the internet?
 //edit: Side-note. I'm not going to expose my home IP anymore. I have a site-to-site VPN running to a virtualized environment in a datacenter. When I'm going to expose it, I will use a reverse proxy in my datacenter environment, to access the webGUI of the NAS at my home network.

 But my pc would simply not see it…
 Can it be some kind of issues with the drive (3.3V) or is it just my old machine which is causing the issues?

I have several webcams (5-10 depending on motivation) inside of my network that I want to keep isolated within my network.

 I want to create a 'gallery' on my apache server that acts as a proxy for those URLs, and pipes the data to the web server. I don't want to expose the backend cams or docker at all.
 At one point I had a system set up that used ProxyPass, but I can't seem to find anything like that anymore.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, im about to get into this rabbit hole...
 A bit of background -- Like 20 years ago i was an Integration Engineer for a Telco vendor and specialized in management systems. I was quite fluent on HP UX and whatever applications we used to use back in the day. Life happened and I went to the Dark Side and became a manager
 Recently i started a job as Prod Mgr in a software related company and I'm kind of fed up of not understanding anything of what our Development guys say (well, i understand the prepositions, conjunctions etc but zero idea of what they mean)
 I want to jump back and do/understand technical stuff. I definitely cannot learn by reading, I only do it by trying myself and seems that a homelab is a good way of achieving my goal
 I don't have anything specific i want to do initially besides learning. Areas of interest are Docker and Kubernetes as my company is moving everything to this. Also want to learn how to use Grafana, Loki, Prometheus
 Also some use cases that i want to explore to justify buying a server are Plex and perhaps Home Assistant
 Have already read the Wiki here which is EXTREMELY helpful. As of now im thinking on getting an entry level rack server, something like a Dell R720 to get started. Does this sounds reasonable?
 Any other help of pointers you guys can give me are much appreciated

 Is someone who is more experienced with backing up a site was able to give it a go as well?
 EDIT: Seems like the wayback machine has some of the forums backed up but ever post I tried to view was missing.

 I was looking up the Seagate Exos X16 14TB but many people commented its quite loud and they wouldn't put it in their main PC. Sadly, that's exactly what I want to do. 😅
 Are there any 14+ tb hdds that are also quiet but 7200prm? Hell, I may just go big and get 3. Preferably close to that ~$14/tb range.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I thought I was getting the hang of it, but guess I was wrong so I need some help :)
 I have a nice media server setup at home with all the *arr apps, and a couple of other apps, all running with Docker. I would like to access one (or potentially more) of my services over VPN, by using a subdomain of my main domain, which in this case is domain.xyz.
 Let's say I want to access my Overseerr instance from the internet. My goal is to go to overseerr.lan.domain.xyz and be redirected to my docker container which is actually 10.0.0.51:9443.
 With that comes a few questions:
  
I need to setup the A record for my sub domain, but what IP address do I use for it? Do I need a DDNS service that will give me a domain to my router's (also the DNS at my home) IP?
 
Maybe related to the first question, do I need a local DNS server in my home?
 
What do I setup in NPM after creating the sub domain?
 
Where do SSL certs come into this and how do I utilize them in this setup?
 
 Thank you :)
 Edit:
 Forgot to mention VPN. I saw most people recommend WireGaurd and Tailscale, so I'll just check that out as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently shipped a tool for stupid easy self-hosting , but it's focused on the cloud, not on personal hardware. So I ran a poll in our community to see what people actually use to self-host.
 Here are the results:
 - In total, 810 votes were cast (about 0.4% of r/selfhosted members)
 - The most popular option is "From a dedicated server/self-hosting machine at home" - 616 votes 
 - Next up is "With a big cloud provider (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS, etc" - 79 votes (about 10%)
 - "From my own personal device (PC, laptop, Mac, etc)" - 62 votes
 - "With a small local/community cloud" - 21 votes
 The rest had other options in mind (check out comments under the original poll)
 Takeaway: I might need to add the option to self-host on your own hardware to my product. Will work on that then. There's already some indication of what hardware people use (Raspberry Pis, old laptops, Unraid and custom servers..), but a more detailed review calls for another poll.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know I'm going to get ripped apart for this but here goes. Among other forms of data hoarding, I'm also a tab hoarder. I had like 600 tabs open on my Chrome on my android phone. 2+ years of "oh, this looks interesting/useful. I'll look at this later.."
 Some of it was probably just crap, but I had lots of important stuff open too. Stupid I know, should have used bookmarks and sync to backup or something. It was on my to-do list to get the backup sorted, but I didn't get around to it. Procrastination. I accidentally clicked "clear all data" and it's all gone. I've felt shitty all weekend, not even joking. How pathetic is that, I know. Can't stop thinking about the stuff I've lost (or more specifically, the stuff I don't know that I lost, which is 10x worse). Nobody else understands.. Know it sounds melodramatic and ridiculous but that's how I feel. Think this is probably one of the only places on the internet who understands the feeling, everyone I've mentioned it to is just like "so what?"

 It has to have a self-cleaning base and be fairly good at avoiding obstacles. My place is 90% laminate wood floors and a couple rugs (with a rug pad underneath). Mopping really isn't critical.

 I do not need any fancy features like being able to draw or anything, but standard markdown features like being able to insert pictures and create tables would be nice. It should also be able to read/organize content hierarchically based on the folder structure the files are placed in. The editor should simple and easy to use so that my wife also can use it for here notetaking.
 The most important thing is that the I am able to open the notes in any other markdown editor and that I can later replace the editor and just point to the same folder(s). I.e. I need an editor that works on actual markdown files rather than storing the content of the files in a database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I'm here because I have a small problem and can't find a solution googling online.
 I have a server in my LAN, it's configured with Ubuntu Server 20.04 and Docker, and everything runs on Docker.
 I have Traefik V2.8 as a reverse proxy.
 At the moment, my domain is linked with my house ip address, but I wanted to change that to be more relaxed in letting my friends use services like Nextcloud and Searxng or pihole around the world, so I bought a VPS (the $1 one from IONOS, with 1VCore and 512MB RAM) with the idea of creating a VPN connection and routing the HTTPS traffic to my LAN.
 Problem is, it's not working and I don't know why.
 If I put Traefik in network_mode: service behind the Wireguard container, I can ping the VPS Wireguard container from it, but I don't know how to route the traffic from the VPS to Traefik and make Traefik accept it.
 I tried with NGINX on the VPS, but the proxy_pass isn't working.
 I configured it like that:
 server { listen 80; listen 443; location / { proxy_pass http://10.13.13.2; } } 
 10.13.13.2 is the IP of the Wireguard container on my home server. 
 Also, I have to implement the same thing for a friend who can't open ports on their modem (that's why I'm not using other stuff like the docker overlay network). 
 Another configuration could be running Traefik on the VPS, and reverse-proxying to containers through VPN to solve the problem of having to proxy stuff through NGINX to Traefik, but in this case I have absolutely no idea how to connect Traefik on the VPS to the docker network at home... 
 Thank you in advance for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've long been using these mini PCs as my home router. The current gen on Amazon for reference ..
 https://www.amazon.com/ZOTAC-ZBOX-N3160-DDR3L-1600-SATAIII/dp/B01N95X5KH/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=zotac%2Bmini%2Bpc&qid=1664674168&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjEyIiwicXNhIjoiNS4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjMuMzQifQ%3D%3D&s=electronics&sprefix=zotac%2Bmini%2Celectronics%2C158&sr=1-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5&th=1
 I just install linux on one of these, configure routing / firewall / dhcp / etc. It hits the sweet spot for me, small, silent, dual ethernet ports. I don't care about the wifi and keep it disabled.
 Now I have occasion to run IEEE 1588 / PTP on my network. I'd like to host the grandmaster clock on my router. However, the box I have (slightly older version of the link above) does not support hardware timestamping on the ethernet NIC.
 ​
 0 % ethtool -T enp2s0 # the other interface shows the same capabilities Time stamping parameters for enp2s0: Capabilities: software-transmit software-receive software-system-clock PTP Hardware Clock: none Hardware Transmit Timestamp Modes: none Hardware Receive Filter Modes: none 
 ​
 I'm looking at new hardware, and I'd like to get something very similar to what I already have, but with a newer ethernet chipset / support for 1588 HW timestamping. I've had a really difficult time determining, for the candidate hardware, whether the onboard NIC will have this capability.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey people.
 I'm looking to build a more proper rack based homelab for VM's, NAS and networking but my office is upstairs and basically full and my NBN node is actually in my garage so it seems my only option is to set the rack up in my garage.
 Is there anyone here from Australia and more specifically in a more humid climate like QLD who has their lab in their garage? and if so is there anything extra that should be done? My garage is extremely clean and only other purpose is for my gym setup and a freezer so it should be a nice environment for it.

As an IT engineer I just wanted a place on the web that I could see my notes wherever I was. Unfortunately, after 12 years of keeping it up, I can't afford it anymore. It will cost £95.99 again this year, I can't fault Krystal Hosting as their customer support has always been really good. I just can't justify paying that this year.
 I'm going to speak to them to see if I can possibly get a cheaper package but I was thinking of just hosting it myself on and off. So it won't be on all the time. I have a spare Raspberry Pi that I could stick it on. Just don't know how easy it is to host your own wordpress site.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have an almost unused
  
HP Z220 Intel Xeon E-1240 V2 CMT
 32GB RAM
 256GB SSD for OS
 6TB x 3 for NAS
 4TB x 2 for backups.
  
Is this good for a Homelab virtual server + NAS.
 I am not into gaming or video editing. I will probably run Emby or Plex for media and will run 2 - 3 Windows VMs for family members and two Linux VMs as my dev server.
 I am planning to install Proxmox on it. It will be running a couple of VMs ( windows 10 pro + Linux Mint) and a TrueNAS instance severing as NAS. I am wondering if this config will be able to handle this workload.
 I am pretty new to all this. So bear with me if I have a few things backwards.

All the nextcloud alternatives I find seem to focus on the file sharing aspect of alternatives, so I'm curious if there are any other decent apps that could replace it.
 I tried homechart, but the requirement on a 3rd party account for a locally hosted server, along with the massively large ads asking me to subscribe, quickly made it a no-go.

 Could you please advice me on what are the specs that are needed to create a home media server ? I already have a NAS 720+ with arr apps and jellyfin but I am not satisfied with its transcodification capabilities (I've been struggling to read medias on my android TV).
 I solved the problem by installing jellyfin on my computer et the rest on the NAS but i'm looking for something that is standalone (basically I don't want to keep my computer on just for jellyfin)
 So I'm looking for a mini PC (or else?) that could transcodify movies and series easily and will handle arr apps + torrent and usenet downloader
 I already have a GTX 1060 with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 but it maybe overkil (also I heard that AMD cpu are not suited for video transcoding so I can't use it alone)
 Thanks a lot for reading, have a nice evening !!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just installed Deskpool and the entire thing is very very sketchy. First of all, all of the posts I can find about it are from the creator of it, and everything is in Chinese. The user interface seems very outdated(think ESXI but 10x worse and slower). And instead of asking for an API Key for hypervisor integration, it asks for the ROOT password.
 ​
 Also even though they accept commercial payments, they don't have any copyright (at least that I can find) or a entry in the Better Business Bureau database. There website https://www.deskpool.com/ is also sketchy (at least it feels like it with everything else) with basically 0 documentation to speak of. 
 Has anyone actually deployed this before? If so has anything been weird?

 I have an Oracle instance running a couple of apps, with nginx Proxy Manager, proxied through Cloudflare, with Auth0 handling the auth. It all works fine, except for the firewall rules in Oracle. I have all of the Cloudflare IPs and Auth0 allowed on the firewall, but I can't get beyond authentication unless I have a 0.0.0.0/0 rule in the firewall.
 Does anyone have tips on how to pinpoint the issue? It's my first time dealing with this combo of services, and I thought I had everything done correctly, but obviously not!
 Thanks.

 I have a mylastname.tld domain and am planning to host multiple services via docker (publicly but only for personal use) and make them available via subdomains via Caddy reverse proxy. I am pondering whether to use my aforementioned domain like for example git.mylastname.tld or to use other formats like git.home.mylastname.tld or another main domain (instead of mylastname) altogether.
 This is not about the technical realisations, these are clear to me, just curiosity about how others organise and use their domains or if there is something like a best practice.

 I would like to do something similar to this, but using nomad.
 If I understand correctly the nomad documentation I have to setup a CNI network for this. This is my config right now:
 json { "name": "mynet", "cniVersion": "0.4.0", "plugins": [ { "type": "bridge", "isDefaultGateway": true, "ipMasq": true, "ipam": { "type": "host-local", "ranges": [ [ { "subnet": "172.22.0.0/16" } ] ] } } ] } 
 Nomad parses the config, gives no error message. So far so good. Now here is my job file for pihole:
 ```hcl job "pihole" { datacenters = ["dc1"]
 group "pihole" {
 network { mode = "cni/mynet" port "http" { static = 80 to = 80 } port "DNS" { static = 53 to = 53 } } task "pihole" { driver = "docker" env { TZ = "Europe/Budapest" VIRTUAL_HOST = "pi.hole" PROXY_LOCATION = "pi.hole" FTLCONF_LOCAL_IPV4 = "127.0.0.1" WEBPASSWORD = "piholepass" } config { image = "pihole/pihole:latest" ports = ["http", "DNS"] ipv4_address = "172.22.0.2" volumes = [ "/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/etc:/etc/pihole", "/home/voroskoi/.docker/pihole/dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d", ] } } 
 } }
 ```
 If I use network.mode = "bridge" and comment out ipv4_address this job file works fine. However this version starts up normally, but it can not reach the internet:
  [✗] DNS resolution is currently unavailable 
 I have checked that CNI takes care of routing, the proper nat tables show up with ifconfig.
 Any idea how should I fix this? Anything else to check?

 The words can be heard by clicking on the small speaker icon. But there doesnt seem to be an easy way to download the .wavs themselves. The only way i have found so far is to right click > inspect element. I do know the source url though: https://www.learnpunjabi.org/stat_sound/1.wav. 
 But since we are talking 500 files this would take a long time.
 Is there an easier faster way with which i can download all the wav's in bulk? I know python if that helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have gotten very interested in citrix storefront (web ui) and citrix desktop (Essentially bringing a vm to another device). Mostly, the apps and the auto allocation feature are what I am looking for. Automatically creating VM's or spinning up and down apps for users who connect. The WebUI also seems great. 
 Proxmox might be a part of this, but it can't be the whole solution because it can't autocreate/allocate VM's for users and doesn't shutdown when not not in use. Doesn't help that the web interface is a bit cumbersome and mobile use is basically impossible. Guacamole also is good, but again it can't auto link in with the users database to create RDP/VNC sessions automatically
 I already have Authelia and LDAP setup and have SSO implemented properly. But sometimes I wish I could just spin up a VM with an easier user interface or create a new user with a VM already allocated that could be connected to easily.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an old gaming rig, some new hard drives, a list of things I'd like a personal home server for, and a few steps missing in terms of actually getting everything up and running.
 First is the OS, I'm thinking Debian since I'm more familiar with Debian based stuff than others, but if there's better options I'm up to learn.
 The next stumbling bock is that I'm vaguely aware of containerization being good for things like the game servers and probably an Element instance I want to have but I have no idea where to even begin with that. Is it a "definitely do this", "good practice but not strictly necessary", or "you're probably not gonna need it" sort of thing?
 The last is backups and storage. I've never actually done a proper network share before with Linux, but I'd like to. I've been using an external drive and Timeshift for backups, but it looks like it's more geared towards non-network backups. Is that a problem that should sort itself out once I get a proper share set up or should I probably be using something else?
 Those are my questions. I welcome all help and suggestions you got for me.

 The stats are as follows:
 - 364 tools in total, out of these
 - 229 are open-source
 - 19 are fair-code (licenses that e.g. disallow commercial use, like Elastic license) 
 - 45 are proprietary with easy export options (mostly for reference)
 It's also easy to submit new tools there if anything's missing. Hope these serve as inspiration, there are also links to websites and I plan to add direct links to docs so you can jump to self-host any of those quickly. Hope you like it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This might interest some of you. SanDisk has a lifetime warranty on a lot of their flash media, including MicroSD cards, which I have a lot of for various uses. Their cards don't fail on me often, but a couple times now, it's happened. The first instance, my MicroSD card was replaced with another unit of the one that failed, as expected. But this recent failure was a 200GB card, and I guess they didn't have any more 200GB cards laying around, because they sent me a 400GB card to replace it. Pretty good stuff.
 tl;dr SanDisk is real good with their warranties. Take advantage of them if you have the chance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some people want to use a computer in a room other than the PC is in. That's where these various keywords come in: Remote desktop / KVM over IP / 100ft+ HDMI cable.
 Overall: this is a niche market. higher lag uses are allegedly mostly covered by RDP. I am going to put my gaming PC at my TV and any office work will hopefully be within the cheaper, laggier options like RDP.
 Here's a summary of some things you can search for.
 Remote desktop / RDP
  
requires windows pro or similar
 presumably laggier than a direct wire solution
  
Non RDP software solutions
  
teamviewer
 anydesk ($120/year) https://anydesk.com/en/order
 p2p https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/p2p
 supremo https://www.supremocontrol.com/pricing/
 synergy
 barrier https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Pi-kvm
  
1080p50 (not a typo) x1 monitor
 $275 assembled + needed parts (power supply)
  
bliKVM
  
uses pikvm
 lives in pcie?
 https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/xskinf/looking_for_ip_kvm_shared_between_mac_and_pc/
  
Thunderbolt docks + Corning optical thunderbolt
  
$550ish for cable. additional dock cost
 hand assembled in clean rooms
  
Level1techs KVM
  
not directly relevant but good KVMs are hard to come by
 can't vouch for it but has the right buzzwords
 https://store.level1techs.com/products/kvm-switch-usbc-model
 he mentions around the 5m mark in the video that you can use a pi-kvm to chain a non-IP KVM over IP. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwsznhIBPMc
  
Keywords to look for:
  
optical
 fiber
 KVM
 KVM over IP
 KVM over copper
 HDMI over ethernet
 thinclient
 hdBaseT
 displayport (seems to support more than HDMI)
 note the differences between displayport 1.2, 1.4 etc. and the daisy chain possibilities in there.

 So im doing some research on how events affect donation behaviour. I hope to match news coverage of a specific area with donations to its main NGO. I have the donations data - but I need to figure out to how to scrap data on news for this location (its usually on the news worldwide). What I mostly need is: date of news, is it generally positive or negative, and country(If possible). To some extent also "intensity" of coverage. Any ideas where I could start ? Pretty new on coding so maybe worth mentioning that

 ​
 Parse NGINX -- I use SWAG-- reverse proxy logs (access, error) and fail2ban logs, save the data into a PostgreSQL database, and generate neat reports, maps, and more. Note that adding locations to parsed IP addresses requires the GeoLite2 database.
 ​
 BeatLog!
 Some features I'm proud of and use:
  
Rapidly parses log lines into useful data
 Characterize IP addresses as "Home" or "Outside", based on server's current public IP address.
 Assess outside visitors by location, and other useful metrics
 Separate certain outside connections, i.e. my own devices
 Count outside connections against fail2ban finds/bans. Assess connections that aren't found (filtrate).
 Help figure out appropriate exceptions to my blanket fail2ban filters
 Scheduled log parsing
 Geolocate coordinates when MaxMind database fails to provide names
 Make fun maps
  
​
 Check it out if it appeals to you, and please submit any bugs you find or feedback you consider. As linked in the bullets above, I've tried to put some effort into the documentation to get a user started. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've currently got a 14TB WD sitting on my desk full of legally ripped media and home movies. It was getting close to capacity so I picked up 3 more 14TB hard drives a few weeks ago during a sale. I have a total of 4 14TB HDDs now, 1 basically full. I've also got a 10TB synology DS220+ I back up critical files to that's mostly empty. 
 I was thinking about going with single disk parity on TruNAS or Unraid. I'd set it up first with the 3 new drives and copy all my media over from my desk. Then I'd shuck the WD and add it to my server. I'd then then compress everything to a backup archive once a week and send it to my synology server (I can add 1 more drive to this if needed). 
 Thoughts on the setup? Also advice on TruNAS vs Unraid would be appreciated!

 I would most likely use the NAS for backups and not edit video from it or anything like that. Do you guys think I could trust these drives? Should I maybe way for a better deal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help and have a lot of questions. I am unsure how to keep home network access fast, remote access secure and privacy for my traffic. 
 Currently running OMV + Linux based machine with docker (plex, arrs, vpn etc) but I want to move to a Proxmox host with VMs + containers. I acquired a Dell 730 for a killer price and will be moving to that in about 2 weeks. 
 I want to allow access to plex and something for plex requests to 3 users remotely. These 3 users will only ever access those two plex focused services. 
 I also want to expose about 10-15 services including the two plex ones above to 3 different users. Does this mean I need 2 different dashboards/sites for each user group?
 I thought maybe a reverse proxy (traefik) with authentication? (Authelia) put services behind wireguard to link to my VPN? Do I need something to handle certificates? Lets encrypt ? Cloud flare tunnels? So confused. 
 What's the least complex way to do this and what order do I go in (maybe Traefik then wireguard then ???) Trying to figure out the boot/compose order so everything is ready before the next service starts up. Right 
 I have a domain name that I bought but how to use it Suggestions, links, guides anything to help put these pieces together is appreciated.

 In my quest to replace the seductive tools from GAFAMs in my (and my relatives) mobile/computer ecosystem with self-hosted ones, I want to replace whatsapp. After some research, matrix-synapse coupled with the element client, seems to be a good option.
 If any of you have succeeded in setting up something similar to what I'm trying to do, have tips, suggestions, leads or answers, then I'm interested :)
 Some personal constraints :
  
No domain name bought for the moment, I don't want to depend on any external service, we'll see if this choice will last in time (I also plan to host my DNS server)
 Hosting on a home server on a modest ADSL connection, the upload speed is therefore very low, but I intend to make with it at least for the whole test phase and then eventually mov…]]></summary>

 Jellyfin, Sonarr, Bazarr, Radarr, qbittorrent, Adguard Home, Watchtower, Syncthing, Portainer
  
Only 2 things I use from Synology Package Manager is SMB Share and Tailscale for remote access.
 And I also require a Windows VM where I'll need a USB passthrough which Trunas scale and core didnt offer, which made me switch to Xpenology.
  
Downside I ran into is Jellyfin Transcoding requires Nvidia driver to be 470 or above, Xpenology only offers 440.44 with no way to upgrade.
 So I'm looking for a Free OS or Hypervisor, that allows me to run every thing i have now in Docker containers and also offers me HW transcending in Jellyfin using Nvidia, plus allows me USB passthrough in VM and remote access with Tailscale.
 Thank you in advance.

 I've tried looking online but searching "Wookieepedia archive" only gives fandom articles on archives which exist in the SW universe.
 I just despise the fandom website so much that I wanted my own copy of the old Wookieepedia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. 
 Hope this is the right spot to ask....
 So, today some weird things started happening on my network. All the apps that rely on "outside access" (nextcloud, home assistant etc...) stopped being contactable from the internet. My setup is wan <-> router (pppoe) <-> lan <-> nginx reverse proxy <-> apps/services. Nginx is running on an Unraid server, in a docker container with letsencrypt and duckdns "autobots".
 In any case, I started seeing that one by one clients started "falling off" from my services. My phone wouldn't sync with NextCloud, people's locations didn't update in HomeAssistant.... Checked port forwards, firewall rules, nginx settings/log and finally went to check if "my" domains were "listed" on DNS providers. Well, what I think I found out using dig web service is that my domains names - IPs aren't propagating through DNSes around the world. Most simply have no record of my domains, some have old IPs assosciated and just one or two point to the right IP. Checked also through https://dnspropagation.net and found out only 5 from 21 DNS providers checked gave any answer (the other timed out) and only 1 of those five gave the right IP (the other gave an IP that changed about half an hour ago).
 I checked also test.duckdns.org music.duckdns.org collage.duckdns.org (names that seemed would exist as (sub)domains) and all of them time out on most DNS providers.
 Does anyone know what's going on? Anyone experiencing similar things?
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to create a high availability cluster in my homelab and (it may not be 100% necessary but) I want to use 5 of the same exact machine. I don’t have 5 of any version of Raspberry Pi and it would be cost prohibitive to do so. And since demand is high for Pi’s…
 The thin clients I’m looking at have AMD quad core processors (2.4 GHz) and come with 8GB RAM and 64GB SSDs. Power consumption is typically around 15W and being x86, I’ll never have to worry about finding compatible Docker images. Best of all, they’re going for around $50 each, so my existing Pi collection - even selling them for less than the crazy top-dollar prices currently found on eBay - should pay for 5 thin clients. (That’s important because I’m currently unemployed and can’t add any $ to make this happen.)
 Does this seem like a good idea to you? If not, why not?
 Thanks for your time and consideration!

 ​
 Now planning to move the setup to a new machine with i5-9300U and Nvidia 1660Ti (6GB) machine with 16GB(can upgrade to 32GB as well) ram. I want to run the services that can also take advantage of the graphic card. So here are my questions
  
Is windows going to be better in terms of docker/services taking advantage of graphics? (I know docker in windows is VM whereas docker in linux run natively)
 I do see instructions to make docker use Nvidia graphics using NVIDIA container toolkit. Do they also apply to docker desktop? 
 Asking the above questions because it seems to be easy to manage docker containers through docker desktop app instead of old method
 
 Please suggest the services for photo/videos & surveillance that can use my hardware optimally (both CPU and GPU) to render the content. 
 So far I have only seen Jellyfin that I can make it use the graphic card for video rendering and it worked great.
 
 Also suggest if there is any service other than Nextcloud(pi) that is better and can complement Jellyfin/Photoprism 
 Seafile is not for me because of it's block based storage which makes it hard to backup my data to a cloud
 
  
Thanks for any inputs and suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 28TB in a Synology 5-bay NAS, and am reaching reasonable limits to upgrading within the five bays, so I was considering just building a custom NAS in an old PC case and running my storage/Plex of TrueNAS (haven't decided yet fully). The current drives are all still good and I would like to reuse them, but the data is stored in an SHR raid. I have a cloud backup in Synology's proprietary's HyperBackup format.
 Is there a smart way of moving my data onto the new system once I have it set up, or do I need to download the backup data and hope all works out with the Synology backup explorer (which I can only really test once I've deleted the original SHR data off the hard drives)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am running a single Proxmox server with a few LXCs and VMs. 
 On this, I have a single Ubuntu VM that acts as my main virtualized server for all my docker services. I am using Portainer to manage my containers like vaultwarden, gitea, photoprism, ghost cms and such. 
 The volume data for all containers are stored by a TrueNAS Core VM that provides SMB/NFS access to my ZFS datastores.
 This works flawlessly and is rock solid. However, I'd like to play with kubernetes a bit. I've already seen some tutorials about spawning up a few LXCs or VMs as workers and then start from there.
 However, I still don't understand the benefits of using kubernetes on a single host. I'd assume that it only makes sense on a cluster with several physical servers in case on goes down.
 If my single proxmox server goes down, then it does not matter whether I am using a single VM or a virtualized cluster of several LXC/VM on the same server. The likelihood that a single VM/LXC fails, which could be covered by Kubernetes, is considered very low tbh.
 Am I missing something or are there some benefits of using kubernetes on a single server? Is the increased complexity worth it anyhow?
 Thanks in advance!

 Whats the best way to check for this (besides going through everything manually) bc the data it would need is already there. 
 Does a program for that already exist?

 Buy something like blah404.xyz, it's about $40 for 10 years.
 Then, setup subdomains/zones like: *.machine_name.wan.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.local0.blah404.xyz, *.machine_name.vpn0.blah404.xyz, etc.
 And, of course, these can all be compatible with Caddy and other pieces of software for automated SSL certificate management from LetsEncrypt.
 And, yes, you can set these to Private IPs as well. It's low-risk to do that, AFAICT.
 And, I have a bash script that works on my linux server and my macbook that works with arrays and other goodies to help me quickly set the IPs (cron jobs too) by using Cloudflare's API.
 Now, I no longer need to mess with my AdGuardHome instance because, via standard DoH or DoT, I can access all the DNS records I'd need for public or private use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To clarify what I mean in the title: I need help deciding on the best method to use for remoting into my homelab/network from the outside.
 ​
 I've currently got three options I'm deciding between, and I'm not sure which one would be the best long-term. 
 ​
 Option 1: I have a router that has VPN capability built in. I can set up the VPN on the route, download the OVPN client, put it on whatever device I will need to have access the home network, badabing badaboom.
 Option 2: Bastion host. I have a few spare devices I could turn into a bastion. Got a Lenovo T470 that isn't currently doing much, got a RaspberryPi 4 that isn't doing much, I could also spin up a VM on proxmox to act as a bastion.
 Option 3: Jump server. This one honestly seems a bit overkill and superfluous. The idea of hitting a machine then having to reauthenticate to another machine on my home network just sounds like a chore (I've also heard some people argue that in the modern cloud a bastion host is a type of jump server, I disagree, but I digress).
 ​
 So what I'm looking for is just to get some ideas about what others have done for their home network and how well it's been working from a security standpoint and a reliability standpoint.
 Thanks in advance!

 fiber scared me as of now but as the days go on, my lab and date requirements expand, and the distances I need that data to travel fiber is becoming the only option. So fiber it is but im kind of walking into it blind so here I am turning to the smart people of reddit.
 ​
  
I have unifi gear, does ubiquiti have their own transceivers? or do they just use the same ones? format? standard? as someone else like cisco?
  
​
  
 multimode LC is the best for what i want right? (long 10g run through conduit)
  
​
  
 do i need to find the distance and buy the correct length? and if so where? fs.com? or do i want to learn how to terminate fiber.. which from what ive seen isnt rly something you just.. do.
  
​
  
how far under the rated distance can I be before i risk burning out the receiver?.
  
​
 i think thats all, thank you all in advance.

 I have two P822 controllers in my dl380 g6, to replace the p822 on the original backplanes, and they aren't able to turn on the blue led to identify the drive in question. 
 Is there some sort of fix for this? It seems odd that they don't work since it's all HP oem hardware. 
 I'm hoping it's just a seating issue or something from cleaning a while back, two drives read "5TB SATA 512e HDD" but the bad one reads "5TB SATA HDD", not too sure why as I haven't dug in too far yet as I'm occupied, but wanted to get this posted.

 Is there any alternative to meshcentral for a webui to manage multiple vpro systems with remote desktop capabilities?
 Edit : i've figured out what's going on.. i'm hosting Meshcentral on a vps and have 3 tailscale failover subnet routers.. one on each vpro server as an LXC.. it all depends on which subnet router is being used.. whichever it is is the one i cannot access from meshcentral... i'll bring it in house and away from the subnet routers and that should solve my issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently accessing my self hosted applications through a VPN (ZeroTier). The problem with this approach is that each user that wants to use a service, or even myself, needs to join the ZT network, and have it enabled. Even if other people were not to use the network, it's still bothersome to me, since the ZT network on my phone consumes a lot of battery, and all the traffic is going through it which I'm not too fond of.
 So the option is obviously opening ports. However this has security risks which I don't want to have, and I began looking for alternatives. It seems that a tunnel with Cloudflare would be a good option, but there's some thing I want to understand about it.
 Cloudflare seems to simplify security, since they automatically detect and block suspicious connections, and they offer many tools to manually restrict connections with various arbitrary filters. However, let's say that there's some services I self host that I want to allow everyone to access, and there's some others that I want to restrict to selected users, how risky is this? Isn't a chain as strong as its weakest link?
 If I have an application open to the public, couldn't a vulnerability in that application compromise my entire network? Assume each application is running on its own docker container of course.
 I use a reverse proxy with nginx to access each service with a subdomain. Does Cloudflare limit my ability to do this in any way? I saw that I may need to add applications one by one, can I use a wildcard redirect or something?
 And also, does Cloudflare have data limits and speed limits? Since all my traffic would be going through them via the tunnel... I guess this is par for the course. It would really suck if that's the case, but I guess deep down I already know the answer.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 I have a question at the moment. When or with what reasons to create a new Docker stack for your self-containers?
 For context:
 I have a Synology NAS and I use Docker to run my applications. The *arr, Jellyfin, Heimdall, Calibre-web, Dazzle, Portainer, Duplicati, Vaultwarden, Watchtower, VPN client and 2 VPN connected download services and others.
 Portainer is run separately and all other services in a docker-compose (a stack in Portainer).
 The domain name and subdomains are managed by Synology.
 I want to add Swag instead of Synology's reverse proxy. Because I have to open a lot of firewall ports to make it work with Synology's reverse proxy and I don't like it.
 After that, I want to use Home Assistant because I have many sensors in my apartment.
 Then add a Grafana to monitoring the services.
 And Authelia or Authentik
 So the stack is starting to have a lot of services. And I'm wondering if I should separate it or not. But I can't think of any good reasons. And if I do. Do I have to manage 2 watchtower services and 2 swags? One per stack?
 ​
 Sorry for the language.
 Thx for the sharing

Did a few searches and saw that it seemed like a good deal. I have always used the off the shelf routers like netgear....etc and figured this would be something fun to learn how to use and add to my home network. Can it be set up and used without having to purchase other devices? In other words replace my Netgear router for starters?

 I don't know if it is the right subreddit to post this, but I believe it will fit.
 I'm actually the happy owner of a dell R715 (Dual AMD Opteron 6320 + 256GB of DDR3 ECC). And I just setup jellyfin on it and then I wondered if I could put a GPU inside the server. Hopefully this server already have x16 pci riser so I could put any gpu I wanted. But I noticed that this server doesn't have any extra plug to add more powerful GPU like some server do. 
 So at first my head turned over my collection of old GPU, and I wonder if any of them could help in that regards (even just a little bit):
  
ATI RADEON HD X1300
 ATI RADEON HD 2400 PRO
 ATI RADEON HD 2400XT
 ATI RADEON HD 3450
 ATI RADEON HD 6350
 NVIDIA QUADRO FX 370
 NVIDIA GEFORCE 6200TC
 NVIDIA 7300GS
 NVIDIA 8400GS
  
The Radeon 6350 is the most recent of the bunch if i'm not mistaken, but I don't know if it is useful or not in this scenario.
 I'm also wondering what if I buy a new GPU, what is the best cheap GPU for this purpose (used or new) Should I buy an older quadro ? Should I buy a 1030 or 1650 ? And what would be the downside of each ?
 Thank you for any help ! Have a nice day !

Basically, I want to no longer be able to access the apps by typing in the ip:port, but through the reverse proxy. Would definitely love if there was some way I could do this in the portainer gui.
 My ultimate goal is to use the docker npm as the way to access my apps internally with simple names like homer.server.local or something like that. Then have another reverse proxy to use for external access pointing to the internal names.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am currently using SyncbackFree V10 to backup my files locally. However, the free version does not support versioning and the license for the paid version is valid only for the version that you paid for. Currently they are in V10 and I'm not sure when they will update to V11. I'm worried that if I pay for V10, they will update to V11 very quickly, then I have to pay again. 
 For cloud backup, I currently don't have any. I do have a Nextcloud server set up and is using the Nextcloud software to sync certain folders/files.
 I'm trying to see if there are better alternatives, free or paid. If free, I need versioning as my critical files are changing everyday and I schedule daily backups for those files & folders. If paid, is there a better licensing method compared to Syncback?
 My requirements are as follows:
 1) Local backups and Nextcloud server backups
 2) Able to choose which folders/files to backup for Nextcloud separately from local backups
 3) Versioning
 4) Incremental Backup
 5) Scheduling
 6) File integrity check
 7) Need to be able to restore individual files
 8) I'm not sure if I need image backups as sometimes I like to wipe my computer clean and reinstall only the software that I really need at that time. A lot of crap can build up over months/years of using the computer and I do not want those crap to be restored.

 As the title suggests, I need help. Since Dell decided to downgrade their user experience by pulling the platform specific bootable ISO, we've been force to use the repository manager, except the user experience of it is the equivalent of rubbing my bare genitals against hot gravel, and fails to produce anything bootable, when it does decide to download something.
 ​
 I was wondering if anyone had one they backed up or saved.

 So far I've scored a couple of Dell T5810s workstation and an unmanaged 5-port switch as well as two Thinkpads for my homelab. I don't know how I can start to begin processing it as I am somewhat of a novice, but I've got a couple of idea. The workstations themselves I think are around on the older side of Intel Xeon processors, and are mostly 16GB of ram without any sort of max storage. My idea was to get a couple of SSDs & HDDs and two more graphic cards (one is rocking a 1060, so I'll probably grab a few more or update to a 1660) to do some machine learning, but I don't know where to start on that end.

 I would like a storage solution that can hold on to at least 20TB of files without risk of sudden failure ("redundancy drive" seems to be a key term here). It needs to be able to handle multiple python scripts running at all times to record Twitch streams while serving video via Plex or Jellyfin.
 Bonus points for upgradability. The cheaper the solution that meets all these requirements, the better. Feel free to go over on price as much as needed. I'm aware that $500 is probably optimistic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to have my data, which is currently about 1.8 TB, encrypted and secured with a filesystem having the nice features of checksumming and compression.
 My storage media: 
  
My Passport (WDC WD20NMVW-11EDZS2) 2TB USB external HDD (My main disk)
 An old 1TB laptop HDD (2.5”) now in an HDD caddy inside my laptop
 An old 1TB 3.5” HDD that connects via a SATA-USB adapter
  
The latter two disks have successfully gone through badblocks and smartctl tests, so I assume they are wiped and ready to go.
 I use a 250GB SSD for my Windows and Linux dual-boot installation, and I don't intend to include it in my setup.
 Unfortunately, at this moment I can't afford adding a new device (I live in a very poor country with hyperinflation).
 BTRFS and ZFS seem to be the most popular and suitable ones for me, but don’t know if BTRFS has completely healed its bad reputation. ZFS sounds interesting and I really want to learn it, but I don’t know if ZFS is recommendable for my small setup, plus, my RAM is 12GB and non-ECC . I’ve also read about some filesystems that would cause problems if you run out of space, I want to avoid them.
 The ability to access the FS on Windows is good, but not completely necessary. WinBTRFS doesn’t seem to be 100% reliable to not corrupt the data on Windows… but not sure.
 So what filesystem do you recommend to me? What encryption scheme is recommended? I’ve heard that some filesystems have builtin encryption. I assume, first I have to create an encrypted filesystem on the two other HDDs and copy the files to them. Then I should wipe the external HDD, and create a filesystem on it and copy the files back.
 Your help would be much appreciated.

 The OS is Windows 10 LTSC.
 There's a couple of bus powered USB drives attached but for the majority of the day, it sits idle..
 It's pullin a pretty constant 50w of power..
 I can't for the life of me figure out why.. i'm hoping someone can tell me "it's your CPU" or something similar to stop me endlessly searching for a software solution.
 CPU usage sits at around 14% due to Blueiris and Goodsync running..
 Any help to get this thing running a bit cheaper would be appreciated!

 My budget is about $150. Need good airflow on the drives. I currently have an old Phanteks enthoo something with 8x8tb drives. Two of the drives are in the bottom of the case with no air flow, so I run the case without the front panel and a box fan in front of it, obviously not ideal I am ready to move on.
 I do not have a rack and not going that route, but if some type of rack mount style is the only thing with good airflow for 10x drives I would be willing to make it work. My mobo is mATX if that matters.

 I've gotten myself off of blocklists and my IP reputation and domain reputation shows to be okay on places like Talos and Spamhaus, however gmail still is marking my emails in spam.
 Is my domain permanently screwed now? I will never send any number of high volume emails from this domain because its for personal use only. Will it basically be impossible to rebuild my domain reputation because of low volume? Will the reputation recover over time even if I'm sending a very very low volume of emails?
 I don't host my own email, I forward to Office 365, and use AWS SES to send automated emails to myself for home automation purposes. In hindsight I should've used a disposable domain for automated emails for this reason. 
 As much as possible, I'd like to keep this domain because it's my family name.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I'd like to replace my enterprise servers with something less (noise-making, power-hogging, heat-creating, space-occupying) and more (processing power, memory).
 Currently I'm using Proxmox to run 3 or 4 VMs on an ML110G7 with 16GB that's been working fine for years, but the E3-1220 is starting to pant a bit under load. It's hosting Homeassistant (OS) , Jellyfin, LMS/Subsonic and Piwigo, each on separate guest machines (I know I could run them all in docker, but.. I don't wanna).
 My thoughts are to replace the ML with either a couple of HP Elite or ProDesk minis for a slight processing upgrade, or a single Beelink SER with a Ryzen 5 or 7 for a bigger bump. Prices are roughly comparable for 2x micro business desktops or one beefier Beelink. Think around $500 CAD.
 I don't need dual NICs (or >1Gbps), don't need more GPU grunt than the iGPUs, and 32GB ram is plenty for the use case, so expandability isn't a concern. 
 Your thoughts on mini business DTs vs Beelink (or similar) mini-pcs?

 I'm getting more and more services in my selfhosted setup, some of them would benefit from having a mail account set up. So I was thinking about a mail server for just internal use. I would set it up with whatever DNS records are necessary and then restrict it again to local use. ideally, it comes with a web client.
 Any suggestions for what to use? Already checked out https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted#communication---email---complete-solutions but can't really decide, what's useful.
 I'm running a Dell PC as server with Ubuntu 22.04 and Docker, I have a own (full) domain.

Got it all working on a reverse proxy and the windows client, web client, and iOS client can all see the docker through my domain. However the time on the iOS app keeps coming up as UTC instead of GMT standard. 
 I can't for the life of me figure out how to change that. The windows client has the correct times however. Wiznotes support page mentions this but I have no idea how to enter the commands. Tried in console to no avail. Any help on how to do this and where greatly appreciated. Not so versed in console/terminal commands for linux. 
 " 
 🕰Modify the Time Zone
 For example, change the time zone to UTC/GMT+08:00
 docker exec -it wiz /bin/bash cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai /etc/localtime exit 
 ⏳Get local time zone
 Linux
 Add -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime
 to the running command to get local time zone
 run --name wiz -it -d -v ~/wizdata:/wiz/storage -p 80:80 -p 9269:9269/udp -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime wiznote/wizserver 
 MacOS
 -e TZ=`ls -la /etc/localtime | cut -d/ -f8-9`

 Again, I know it's a non-issue, just wanted to post my thoughts. Being stuck at home with covid is boring.

I wish to use cloudflared to connect to the domain and any subs. Now, if I want wordpress installed to a subdomain "wordpress.mydomain.com", do I have to change any ports in the docker-compose file? Or leave the default "ports: - 8080:80"? Or are there any other config or environmental variables I need to adjust?
 I will need to install nginx in a container afterwards as well, yes?
 I'd like the main url "mydomain.com" to host a different site/page, just a basic html/css entry page I can put together. And wordpress in the subdomain.
 Thank you.

 Situation: there is a powercut in my house and UPS ran out of battery after some minutes.
 When power returns, seconds later i turn on the UPS battery and it shows a 100% charged battery!! (which have no sense)
 later, when there is another powercut, UPS battery ran out of energy in seconds too... (like never charged)
 this is a issue with the battery so i have to replace it? or is directly a UPS glitch so i have to get a new UPS?
 or every time UPS get out of battery i must wait 12 hours letting charging turned off and all the previous is an expected environment? 
 PD: didn't found a UPS battery group here in reddit, only the UPS delivery service xD sorry if here is not the appropiate place
 thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What happened?
 Hello all. I had to make a very painful data loss a few days ago due to an update error from NextCloudPi and had no backup for some now lost files.
 This now brings me to the point that I finally want to think about a backup strategy and I definitely need your help. I've always read a lot about this, but couldn't really do anything with it because it was too abstract.
 What is the current status?
 I have a RAID 1 system with 2x 4TB NAS hard drives connected to my Ubuntu server. I never expected that a software error could delete all my cloud files, but now I've been proven wrong. I don't do automated backups at all. At most, I manually copy the most important things to an external hard drive every few months.
 The file system is ext4.
 What I know could be helpful
 I know for example that there is btrfs as a file system and there is snapshot, but there it already starts, because I do not understand the functionality. Could that have helped me in my case where all the files were deleted? Then I know that there is rsync, which does more or less the same thing that RAID 1 already does (if I understood correctly).
 ​
 Of course, it would also be very efficient to save the data again on an external hard drive, for example. But I don't know how this can be automated, because it would have to be connected all the time, which would quickly exceed the life of the hard drive. I definitely want to keep everything local and not fall back on external cloud providers such as Mega, Google, OneDrive, etc.
 ​
 So let's first discuss the best realization in my case and possibly afterward how the whole thing is technically feasible. I want to make a backup of everything and not only of the data in the cloud but also of the rest. Thank you very much in advance!

 I don’t have data more than 2TB right now. So I want to buy a 2TB HDD. But I read here that 2.5” hdd below 8TB are generally SMR and not that great quality wise.
 I have a sale going on in my country on WD and Seagate HDD. 
 Question:is it a good decision to buy a 2TB wd or seagate HDD or shell out more money and buy 3.5” HDD with a case to use with a laptop? 
 I want to use this as a backup hard disk.

 I neglected my backups. There, I said it. I gotta change something about it though and I would like to learn about the dos and don'ts.
 I got a small server I would like to backup. I intend to use restic for it.
 Is the following approach already fine? Or am I missing something?
  
There's a restic repository on the server where I backup my files to.
 I sync the restic repository to an external drive.
 I sync the external drive to another external drive (weekly).
 I upload the contents of the external drive into my cloud.
  
Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So due to many terrible political decisions made recently and not-so-recently, electricity prices in the UK are rising absurdly quickly at the moment. 
 Just over 2 years ago we were paying 13.31p/kWh. Prices more than doubled in April this year and are going up again now to 34p/kWh. Business rates are as high as 93p/kWh.
 I'm currently running a 12 bay Supermicro server with 128 GB RAM and dual Xeon E5-2650 v2. It uses approx 4.2 kWh per day so running costs have gone up from £17/month to £44/month and are set to rise more soon.
 I'd like to move to a more power efficient option to save money. I don't desperately need the dual Xeons, all I need is the following
  
10-12 bays
 enough processing/GPU to be able to run Plex for 1-2 people
 2 ethernet ports
 quiet enough in a cupboard
 nice to have at least one ethernet port 10 GbE
  
If I can spend a few hundred quid on lower-power hardware, I'll make my money back in a couple of years.
 What are my options? I'm up for any ideas about more efficient hardware than can still hold a decent number of drives. I'd probably prefer not to build in a PC case as I'm sure there are lower power prebuilt options but I'm open to almost anything.

I tried file browser(docker application, that I like), but I cant use file explorer on my main machine to add files which reflect in file browser. 
 My use case is this: I want to add/remove files from my server through smb but through the internet(globally).(please do not recommend nextcloud or file run, they don't work on my server, how so many times I try). Basically I want to add files in my explorer which will get stored in my server, but accesible non-locally.
 I don't know how clearly I have explained my use case, sorry if I couldn't help you understand.I dont know how else to put this.

I installed armbian and start to racking my brains trying to get started with docker.
 After I learned the basics of containers, I saw that it was relatively simple to deploy an application with docker, so a need arose: how will I be able to access them outside my local network? (By researching I found that accessing your local network through a vpn seems to be the easiest and most secure method).
 tl;dr: first I need to learn how to put domains on my local network instead of accessing the services by ip address and port. 
 e.g dashboard: 192.168.1.70:8080 -> homer.pi 
 192.168.1.70:9000 -> portainer.pi
 I didn't find any guide for noobs, I just saw that I can do it through the pi-hole but I can't direct to the ports, only to one address.

I'm not planning or running very much on it, but I'm an IT student and it would be nice to have a home server to mess around with and test out things on. I'm concerned however about the power draw because I don't want to spike my energy bill if I have it running 24/7. If I'm not running very much on it would the power draw still be pretty high, or would it scale more to the amount of use it gets?

I'm currently using Emby but the issue I'm thinking I'll run into is I've read the user 'database' file isn't able to be moved or copied while it's open, so if a user connects to one server then disconnects and happen to reconnect to the other server depending on load, their 'viewed programs' list or video resume point won't be up to date.
 I've considered ESXi hosts at both locations that are able to clone but I'm not sure that's real time nor bi-directional?
 Or can anyone suggest another self hosted software that might be able to do the same, Plex or something?

 First of all, lemme tell you that I love this subreddit :) Second of all, over the past few years and with my recent purchase of a Dell Powervault unit, I figured it's a good opportunity to spend some time and budget to figure a rack solution once for all and make sure things can run 24/7. The only issue is I live in a small apartment and this Dell unit I bought is way nosier than I could've imagined. I explored immersion cooling and quite server cabinets (cuz I am a noise freak) but the price for both of these were quite hefty and opening a brand new dell storage to do DIY cooling in 4u is also not an option because it messes up with the warranty and same thing is almost true with immersion cooling as well.
 So, in the end, I found myself thinking more about different spaces in…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since neither my country require, nor our phone provider have a designated demarcation point on-premise (you are even allowed to run the cable up until the neighborhood cabinet, but not inside it), and I finally have the tools required to diagnose our issues, I have decided to start testing (and at the same time, identify which socket is connected where)... Only problem is, I have no idea what to make of the connectors, since while I know that only two wires connect each socket (we have a similar system to BT's here in the walls, however it is wired differently, with the red wire at pin 3 and the blue wire at pin 4), I cannot seem to understand how to test points that have 4 wires connected (two at the top, two at the bottom).
 Of course, I have disconnected the home phone and the DSL (technically VDSL2, with support for at least profile 30a, perhaps profile 35b, although it only has a 100Mbps RJ-45 port) modem/wired router beforehand, and only reconnected them to post this.
 Here is a picture to illustrate what I mean: https://0x0.st/o49r.jpg (I cannot seem to upload to IMGUR with Sync for Reddit)
 I do plan to replace all of our BT sockets with RJ-11 sockets, just to make troubleshooting far easier, since most equipment cannot connect directly to BT for testing (I also need to test cables, after all), with LeGrand's modules making things easier for me there (I will be running both CAT5e for phone and CAT6A for networking, in preparation for my future homelab, after all), and for that I first need to ascertain what plugs where, especially since I need to move where the DSL modem/wired-router is physically connected.

 Hey guys - current config is internet into my Asus router, which has been great but it's reached end-of-software-support and my (wired) network is getting too big for it, so I've roped in another wifi router with NAT turned off to give me +4 RJ45 ports... not ideal. 
 So anyway, I just built a pfSense box and I have a 24-port Cisco 3560 I found in the trash at work. So my plan is as in the linked image at top:
 Internet into pfSense, then on into the Cisco (SFP port 1). SFP port 2 of the Cisco (SFP) will go into the Asus in WAP mode to handle the wifi traffic.
 This page ( https://www.wundertech.net/how-to-setup-vlans-in-pfsense/ ) gives a decent overview of setting up VLANs to segregate traffic but it indicates I'll need to assign VLANs in the switch as well. I can do this but then it begs the question about wireless devices... 
 I imagine the "Trusted Systems" VLAN devices will have access to each other, the internet, and my file server.
 IOT will have access to each other and pfSense NTP.
 Guest will have access only to the internet.
 Since wireless devices will all be coming into the Cisco through one SFP port, I can't just assign that port to one VLAN; if pfSense is handling DHCP, presumably I can use different subnets for the devices by individually assigning IPs.
 By default, new devices would be part of Guest until moved into Trusted or IOT... which is the gap in my current understanding. 
 Thoughts? What am I missing here? Thanks in advance! I'm happy to learn by messing around but since I'll be taking down the entire home network to do this, hopefully it doesn't take too long. ;)

For video selfhosted sites, cloudflare sometimes does weird things and also it is against their policies to stream. But I am wondering, how else can self hosters hide their IP without cloudflare? Is this something I need to worry about? I am planning on adding a firewall machine in front of everything soon anyway, but not sure if that addresses the same thing, probably not.

 What this does. It automatically reads and writes enough "random" to your disk drive optimizing your $badclustr file to lock out all the bad spots on your disk.
 Application? Particularly useful on worn out disks, but will work with new also. Unattended cleanup so you can use that disk again (or use it for cold archives).

 It's an online chat interface for SMS services provided by your own SIP provider using webhooks to send and receive.
 I'm getting ready to move a number I've used for a while to Flowroute, and I'd like to be able to send and receive messages in a similar way. I run FreePBX at home, but can't find an integration that would provide what I'm looking for. 3CX PBX has an SMS/MMS chat feature, but it's ~$150/year to use it.
 I've looked at Twilio, and they seem to have the APIs to do everything I want, but I'm not familiar enough with any programming languages to write something to interface with it.
 I would love to be able to find something that works out of the box, but I'm open to something that would take a little work to get running.

 Unfortunately, the server chipset disabled the internal GPU and Quicksync with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can't figure this problem out. I posted this before on here, but I cleaned the text up now and made the problem easier to understand, so I'm posting again. I'd appreciate any help on this as I'm really at my wits' end here.
 I'd like to use the NginxProxyManager container and have it only accessible when I connect to the server via Wireguard. But I can't get it working.
 My configurations files are: - Wireguard compose file - NginxProxyManager compose file - What my firewall is currently like
 After deploying the previously mentioned files, I copied the Wireguard peer configuration into the app on my computer and connected to it. The issue is that nothing is accessible. I can't Google anything, I can't ping anything, and doing localhost:81 or server-ip:81 does nothing as well.
 I don't think it's a firewall issue either, as when I disable it on my server and try to access any site on my computer there's no change.
 Here are the Wireguard and peer configuration files, with all keys redacted: - Wireguard configuration file - Peer configuration file
 I don't know if it's relevant but the proxy network in docker has a subnet of 172.18.0.0/16 and a gateway of 172.18.0.1.
 I feel like the issue may be the AllowedIPs section in wg0.conf but I'm not sure, plus since I have a dynamic IP how would I even have it in a form where I don't need to keep on editing it every time my IP changes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: if an Intel X540 overheats - what it do? does performance just drop or does it disconnect? I was under the impression of the latter. 
 anti tl;dr: I have two Intel X540s - one in my main PC (Windows 10), one in my server/NAS (Server 2022). Until today they were setup direct-attach. 
 Large transfers of single files (> ~5GB) will start out saturating 10 GbE for a bit, drop to zero and hang, then pick back up. It'll repeat it a few times over the course of a transfer. 
 On a 60GB mkv it happens about a half dozen times (all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it). Smaller files (< ~5GB) are a non-issue. 
 I bought the NICs about two years ago and and tried to figure it out but couldn't and assumed it was a quirk of direct attach. 
 Then I got a deal on a 10 GbE switch (Ubiquiti USW-Flex-XG) and set it up today. I made my X540s my primary NICs in each aaaaaaaand the problem is worse. I'm not even hitting 5 GbE, let alone 10 GbE. 
 Here's iPerf3 - the result is the same in either direction.
 Here's an actual transfer - all the dips in the graph are 0MB/s even though it doesn't look like it. this is to/from an NVME but it happens with any combination of drives (SATA SSDs, RAID 0 HDD array, other NVME). 
 The only thing I can come up with is maybe an overheating NIC? the X540 in my server has a 40mm fan strapped on it (because there's room). The X540 in my main PC doesn't have a fan because there's no room for it and the heatsink is lava. but I was under the impression the NIC would drop if it overheats?
 Windows, Intel ProSET, and Ubiquiti all show 10 GbE. I also tried taking them off auto-negotiate and no difference. 
 Any big brains got any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I've come across a Synology RS812RP+ for sale with 4 2TB Red drives included for £40. It's pretty cheap but I'm aware it's a really old bit of kit (2013). Despite that, is £40 worth it to just have a NAS as I don't have one currently, or am I just paying to shift someone's e-waste for them?

 Proxmox installs on the MVMEs after creating the raid in the installer, but never boots to it after reboot.

It doesn't have a simple docker setup like Amazon has but it has ssh access. So I feel like it should be possible. All the instructions I find are how to do it on your local machine, which isn't what I want to do. 
 Is there a simple guide to getting docker up and running on a server?

 However, on the 25th april 2018, a previous video of this same aim game was uploaded, with the youtube ID https://youtu.be/1qL0rFGB2LA
 The reason why this is so significant is because the score difference between them is about 5 seconds of gameplay. almost a whole year of training to gain 5 seconds on an aim game (because it is so difficult).
 the only place i've seen a snipper of the old aim video is here, at this timestamp specifically. https://youtu.be/E8NtJtyKX-Y?t=133
 I've searched twitter, old video statistic websites, old forums. Through these searches, I even found a video uploaded the day…]]></summary>

Today, with the new ZIP buy-now-pay-later 15% off promotion, the price is $170, which equates to $12/TB. You can save up to $100 on the promo, which is perfect for 3 drives (save $90).
 I know there are concerns about Newegg packaging and warranty, but this seems too good to pass up. My first time buying drives - I think you can just return them if they are damaged / not covered by Seagate warranty right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey. I know this question has been asked before but I still can't find an answer that solves the problem I'm having.
 I have 3 systems, 1st my day-to-day Windows desktop, 2nd my Windows 'cloud gaming' VM, and 3rd my TrueNAS system. My goal is to have all my games from Steam, Epic, Origin and GOG all installed to a Networked Drive/Folder that's stored on the TrueNAS system, which is then accessible to my 1st and 2nd system.
 Most guides suggest mapping my network drive as normal and installing the games there. This however causes permission issues, which can sometimes be solved by mapping in privileged mode and others, games won't even attempt to start.
 Another option which worked fine was mapping an iSCSI drive. However, this has the problem that only 1 system can access the drive (apparently you can have multiple, but it's highly discouraged?). It also seems it's only really good to set an allocated volume size, not just expand the until the drives get full. If I could do iSCSI, would this bypass the RAM and SSD cache I have for that pool?
 So my questions are, what should I do? and Is there an alternative I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I thought I future proofed myself for longer than I did but I'm getting to 70% used on my array and starting to look at expanding again. My problem is I have already used all of my pcie lanes and probably am overusing the pch as well and trying to figure out the best option to start adding more vdevs. 
 My goal is actually to add 4-6 20tb drives and 2 1tb ssds but I'm about out of sata ports before I even got to this point. Is it worth looking at threadripper or some cheaper modern xeons? 
 My current system running trunas core:
 11600k 32gb ram(probably need to up this to at least 64gb) 8 18tb hdds 3 2tb nvme 10gb mellonox card Lsi expansion that supports 8 drives.
 The motherboard has 4 sata ports but is using one for the boot drive and my thought was two other ones for the additional 1tb ssds.
 Just trying to see if anyone has run into a similar issue. Don't know if it's better to just get threadripper or a newer xeon/epyc or maybe at this point just source a cheap small system and have a secondary volume.

 Could also be an ok way to make a slc cache drive since they aren't made anymore(?).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a challenging build I'm looking for input on. I'm looking to build an all-NVMe TrueNAS box with 10GbE using an X16 to 4x M.2 board with bifurcation. However the build is space constrained so I'm stuck with Mini-ITX boards. I've settled on two options I can find:
 AsRock Rack EPYC3101D4I-2T - EPYC 3101 4C/4T
 SuperMicro X10SDV-4C-TLN2F - Xeon D 1521
 The problem is I'm not sure how CPU constrained I will be with these boards given ZFS and the throughput NVMe can achieve, or if there are other options for boards.

But I dont really know if I can trust the source of the app. I figure it cant hurt to try it out, but I'd like to be able to monitor the server for a while and make sure its not trying to phone home, or make any other odd network connections. 
 I have looked into Wireshark, but it is very overwhelming, and even after watching some guides Im not confident in my ability to set it up to watch for the right stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(the below applies also to i5 8400T vs non-T, and i5 7500t/7600T vs non-T, since I still have to decide what CPU to go for, but first I need to fully understand the T-series vs non-T matter)
 Hello guys. As per the title, I was planning to build a small but relatively mighty NAS (mini-ITX, with Unraid) which is also going to be used as a web server, and one of the "requirements" are that it should ideally consume as less power as possible since it's going to stay on 24/7.
 Now, I know the architecture of the two CPUs is the same, but the differences are:
  
TDP, from 65W of the non-T to 35W of the T
 frequencies, especially the base frequency
  
So, in regards to the rated TDP, I know that for Intel it's the maximum allowed power consumption under maximum load.
 So yeah I understand that the T-series under max load will be less powerful than then non-T, hence in theory taking longer to complete the same operation (even due to the lower max frequency), but this is not a concern for me.
 My concern is the following.
 When however the power need is extremely light (which is most of the times I guess, except when I actively transfer large files, or use Plex, etc), is it correct that the T will consume less power thanks to being able to scale down the frequency to a greater extent? 
 The 8500T has a base frequency of 2.10 GHz while the 8500 non-T has a base frequency of 3.00 GHz.
 Does this translate in less energy used by the T-series if compared to the non-T when both are subject to the same light load?
 Is this understanding correct, or am I missing anything?
 I'm asking here as there's plenty of conflicting information on the internet regarding the T-series CPU from Intel.
 Any advice or insights is really appreciated.
 Thank you very much! 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All.
 I've set up Cloudflare to expose some self hosted apps to the web. I've used the Windows tutorials for setting up a tunnel (here) and installing as a windows service (here). 
 However, I'm having two problems:
 1) The tunnel doesn't seem to automatically re-establish after a reboot, but I thought that was the whole point of installing as a service? I need to manually start the tunnel every time
 2) When I manually start the tunnel in powershell, it seems to hang after: 
 2022-09-29T17:27:03Z INF Starting metrics server on 127.0.0.1:51247/metrics 2022-09-29T17:27:03Z INF Connection 7f227281-c6e6-4293-b844-ba1a77477c9c registered connIndex=0 ip=198.41.200.233 location=MAN 2022-09-29T17:27:04Z INF Connection 95624ee5-9a2e-4562-b503-369ddc82b4cc registered connIndex=1 ip=198.41.192.57 location=LHR 2022-09-29T17:27:05Z INF Connection 3417ba7f-6047-444f-9c9d-b185b27f3d18 registered connIndex=2 ip=198.41.200.13 location=MAN 2022-09-29T17:27:06Z INF Connection 2542ce0f-aca3-4e59-80d0-44f899e539ca registered connIndex=3 ip=198.41.192.227 location=LHR 
 i.e. I don't get a command prompt back. A quick look at the cloudlfare log shows this error every 12 seconds or so:
 {"level":"error","ip":"198.41.200.73","connIndex":0,"error":"Unauthorized: Failed to get tunnel","time":"2022-09-29T17:40:11Z","message":"Register tunnel error from server side"} 
 Wondering if anyone has come across this before, and maybe knows of a fix? My Googleing didn't find any solutions.
 Thanks!

I'm not sure if IA can do the same with these as it can with torrent magnet links (paste the link on a text file, rename to something.torrent and IA will download the contents). I can't seem to find the help page either where I saw this before, am under the impression AI could also grab ed2k/Kad metalinks but from my testing it can't.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, all of my mad data lads! I currently have a Supermicro Unraid setup with 130TBs of storage that I use primarily for Plex and personal video storage and I need your help.
 I started a pretty decent non-prof sports photography/videography business and am in need of a big time storage solution for long-term archival and some everyday usage. I wanted to build this out more "officially" and efficiently than my little at-home setup so I figured I would ask for some advice here. I'm also willing to "hire" someone (just out of my own pocket) if there was someone out there that could help me design and put a build together. 
 So my use case, here is what I am looking to do:
  
Have long-term storage for photos and primarily video of Las Vegas High School sports (we are starting with boys and girls basketball this year)
 Being able to store game film from every high school game each season and archive that footage for 10-20 years.
 Have a storage solution that will allow multiple video editors and contributors to edit video (premiere and final cut) from different storage areas directly (will have 5 Mac Studio computers located locally within the same office at the servers, so could do 10GBE runs, etc).
  
Based on the personal storage I have been using for the last 6 months of filming myself I can see how this is going to scale at a massive level and put me in what I would consider the "DataHoarder" zone! I appreciate any assistance from the community I could get for this and hopefully this post is in the right place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I've been trying to figure out an easy (and safe) way to connect to my home servers while I'm at traveling or at work. I have a handful of local servers, but the only internet facing boxes are the Jellyfin server and Minecraft server. The others (Home Assistant, proxmox, etc.) I am not quite comfortable port forwarding to the open web for security reasons.
 That being said, I would really like to be able to access some of these things from outside of my home network, and I would like to be able to do so safely.
 Obviously RDP is off the table, and I was cautioned against using VNC for similar reasons. My question for everybody: how are you all connecting to your home servers? It's probably something simple I'm overlooking, but it would be so nice to use!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 since the first version of paperless-ngx I use - 1.9.0 and today 1.9.2, I have a problem,
 that processing some files of the queue starts but never ends.
 Instead I can see in the Docker Logs teh following: 
 16:21:02 [Q] INFO Process-1:4 processing [file.pdf]
 [2022-09-29 16:21:04,113] [INFO] [paperless.consumer] Consuming file.pdf
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Enqueued 1
 16:21:42 [Q] INFO Process-1 created a task from schedule [Check all e-mail accounts]
 16:24:09 [Q] ERROR reincarnated worker Process-1:4 after death
 ​
 I am not sure, where the problem could be, has anyone experienced similar issues?
 Appearently, I cannot share this exact file, but If you'd like to try on your instance, I have a Datasheet as PDF which does not get consumed either.

Your interest in Fasten was overwhelmingly positive, and its obvious this is worth pursuing further!
 I'm happy to announce that I have a "Beta" version that's available for testing.
 Having said that, there are some limitations to this Beta
  
You can only connect to Sandbox accounts on the healthcare providers (no real/personal accounts yet).
 It's only packaged as a Docker image

 For example, I have a 'Christmas' directory of mp3s. I'd like to create a 'Christmas Channel' that randomly plays one of those to any client listening. (it doesn't have to be directory based, using tags or database or whatever would work too). Same for a 'Hard Rock' directory or such. 
 Or even having a static playlist would work, as long as it's saved server side and all clients can access it.
 
 Ideally I'd also like an android app/client - but having a good mobile webpage would also work.

I rearranged them to a year-month folder structure using local tools (exiftool) and upload them to my server. I also have two rolls of scanned films without proper EXIF info, which are placed in dedicated folders.
 I give both LibrePhotos and PhotoPrism a quick test since they don't touch the structure of original files so I can run them both at the same time.
 Unique LibrePhotos Feature I like: Auto event albums. Super convenient as it basically just needs timestamp. I mainly use my dc to record my dates and LibrePhotos successfully identified most of them.

 I tried adding "resolvectl domain %i internal.example.com" to the end of the postup config. But the docker container doesn't contain resolvectl so it fails
 I've tried editing the search domains of the host, which does pass to the container, no luck
 I've tried mounting a custom resolv.conf into the container, no luck
 There has got to be a way!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a hardware-related self hosting question -- hopefully that is okay. :)
 So, I have an old HP inkjet/scanner combo I've been using forever, to scan full sheets. It does great work but it's been making odd noises lately and I know it won't last forever.
 I'd like to use something to scan things like invoices and receipts, doing so under Unix/Linux.
 Bonus points if I can do the scanning on the command line -- my current solution I have to use X windows and a graphical tool to capture the image(s).
 I'm using a self-authored tool with this stuff to manage finances. Right now I just used it for full invoices, as the scan takes a long time. But I'm hoping to track individual receipts in an integrated manner. (I'd be willing to release part/all of this tool once I get this integration going, it needs some tuning and updating to be fully not-just-me ready).
 Suggestions or helpful advice appreciated, thanks!

 Just how durable are these things, anyway? Will a power outage turn my data into Swiss cheese? Is there a shock-resistant case or something I can put around it? Is the 1% failure rate actually true? Or is that just a marketing thing? I really don't know!
 So yeah. Apologies for the noobie questions, I just really want to make the most out of this thing without somehow screwing myself over.
 EDIT: Jeez. You guys are so passive aggresive. What's wrong with you people?

I have a docker server on windows 11 and I am having issues with WSL randomly crashing or something and losing access to my containers. They are all behind a reverse proxy using a cloudflare tunnel. Anytime it happens all I have to do is run wsl —shutdown from a command prompt and I regain access. But then after a random amount of time it seems I can’t access them and I get the cloudflare error page. I can’t access them locally either with my ip. None of the containers go down and I don’t even know where to look for logs to see if anything is erroring within the kernel. I have tried reinstalling docker and removing wsl feature from windows and re enabling and it still does it. I’ve also looked at the GitHub for wsl and it seems maybe others are having this issue but I can’t find a fix that works for me.

 I have 10 older hard drives (that I bought used) installed in RAID 6 for non-important data, and then 2 newer hard drives in RAID 1. Being a R510 everything is older inside including the RAID card and iDRAC.
 When I try to access the iDRAC via old IE, Chrome, or FF I get: ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH 
 I think the iDRAC is too old? I don't know the version/model off hand, I don't have a need to reboot it to get that info at this point. When I did the install I was able to get into the iDRAC but didn't find it useful or prob more honestly didn't know how to use it... But now I can't get in without full blown troubleshooting and downtime.
 Is there any way to monitor OS health/stats, HDD health, and maybe even get alerts/emails when things change if the iDRAC is dead/old?

I’m incredibly stoked to be able to run cable without having to crawl in the attic. 
 Any big tips or things to be mindful of while I have access to the wall cavities?
 So many posts suggest running 3-4 cables per room, is it really necessary?
 My lab:

 • Ubiquiti 16 Poe switch
 • Ubiquiti 10gb aggregation switch
 • Unraid box (super micro 36 bay)
 • Truenas box (also super micro 36 bay)
 • UPS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope this isn't against the rules, and I am not soliciting... but I am looking for advice on how/where to post a job opening.
 I'm looking for someone to manage a 75 node network that supports a staff of 15. It's got everything from Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS, Android, ESXi, Proxmox, Docker, Ubiquiti, MySQL, and Synology, and in-house built apps. Most of the hardware consists of custom build workstations and servers. We have very little that runs in the Cloud. 
 I've been a longtime lurker in /r/homelab. I built most of this myself and many of the ideas have come from this group. I'm just at the point now where I need someone to take it over full time. 
 The whole lab is accessed remotely by the staff and I need someone who can be there hands on to manage and document it all. Make sure things are backed up, fix/repair broken hardware, do reboots, upgrade/build new workstations as things age, install new software and keep things patched/secure and running. They also need to be organized enough to manage a large volume of data coming in and out of the office on a weekly basis.
 I've posted variations of this to a bunch of job sites and have gotten over 100 resumes to sift through. After a dozen phone screens, no one is coming even close. 
 Most resumes are from people who are Tier 1 Helpdesk who do password resets, break fix, and some basic administration; but no one has ever installed anything from scratch. Only 1-2 people have ever built their own computer or know much about hardware, and no one seems to have any experience in Linux or Docker. Not a single resume has highlighted any Homelab experience.
 So, my question is:
 Where do you people look for jobs? Am I asking for too much? Is the job not attractive because it's not Cloud based? Could there be something horribly wrong with my job description?
 Any advice that can point me in the right direction would be appreciated.

 I've tried Jdownloader2 but it only grabs the current image that is up. I'm thinking I'll need something that refreshes or waits and pulls again? Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm still getting my feet wet with self-hosting and can't figure this problem out.
 So I want to use NginxProxyManager but don't want it publicly accessible. I read I should only access it on localhost then, after connecting to the server via Wireguard, but it isn't working for me.
 My Docker configuration for Wireguard is this, for NginxProxyManager it's this, and my firewall looks like this.
 After deploying Wireguard, I copied the peer config and loaded it into the Wireguard app on my computer without issue.
 But when I connect to it, I can't search on Google, or even access the port 81 that I wanted to (http://localhost:81) in the first place.
 I even tried curl-ing the address. On my server it's fine and I get a response, but when I do it from my computer it just says 'connection refused'.
 Anyone have any hints or ideas on how to fix this?
 I tried adding my IP to my firewall with sudo ufw allow proto tcp from my-ip to 80,443 or something, but it didn't work. I also tried disabling my firewall and then accessing http://localhost:81 on my computer, but that was unsuccessful too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one time, you could just startup an SMTP server and have at it.
 Nowadays though there's (obvious) reasons to not allow just anyone to stick an SMTP server on the Internet, even if it's a send-only server and it's behind a firewall so nobody ever connects to it but you. While you can do this, pretty much any legitimate E-mail service out there will immediately flag anything you try sending as spam, or outright refuse to accept your messages in the first place.
 There's a lot of reasons you might want to be able to deliver arbitrary E-mails - not just to yourself, but to others, possibly across disparate E-mail domains. The vast majority of such messages need not ever be replied to, so even the E-mail address they come from is not necessarily that important, other than that it should be able to be identified by the recipient.
 Are there services out there that are generally trusted to be able to do this, even if for a modest cost? Basically I want to be able to have a reliable way to send both myself and others who are relevant various alerts and messages.
 Examples:
  
I want errors found on ZFS with zed to go to me and a friend,
 I want to design an app that can E-mail a small number of people when I post new content on my Jellyfin server
 I want to have a script send a daily report of some server stats to me.
 I want to have a Web app where a person with an account in my system can submit some kind of job, and when the job has finished an E-mail is sent to the account's stored E-mail address with the results of the job.
  
I know that if I were to just, say, create a Gmail account for the purpose, I could configure my apps to connect to Gmail's SMTP and deliver that way, but I'm not sure Google even allows this type of use in the TOS, and even if that's not a concern, it's likely not going to make you look very good when all your E-mail account is doing is sending out obviously auto-generated E-mails on a regular basis.
 How do you guys handle this?

 PaaS (platform-as-a-service) refers to a model where the service helps you provision and run a platform for hosting apps and/or apps themselves without the hassle usually associated with it.
 New PaaS solutions show up pretty often, but they're either proprietary, lock you in, or aren't friendly for non-developers.Gardens solves all of that. Here's what it does:
  - Makes setting up your own PaaS with an admin panel and setting up apps easy as cake. You don't need to know how to code; there's a library of 130+ apps available. They're set up in one click

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been tinkering with hardware quite a bit – but some things remain mysteries to me and I finally dare to ask those questions in public. Been trying to read up on them online, but some information is scattered and inconsistent.
  
Are SAS hard drives worth it? From what I know internally they're the same as SATA drives and have a physical limit at around ~200 MB/s throughput.
 Why specify SAS' hard drive connections as 6G/12G if throughput is limited to ~200 MB/s anyways?
 SFF-8087 and SFF-8643 are apparently the same electronically, just another physical connector. Is there any difference and can I just use adapters to go from one to the other without performance loss?
 Is there any real world difference between SAS2 6G and SAS3 12G backplanes? From what I understand each SFF-8xxx cable running to the backplane will get one dedicated 6G/12G connection. So serving four drives each that would mean 1,5 Gbps throughput per drive when working with SAS2 6G, right?
 Aren't HBAs limited to 6G anyways? So why even bother with 12G backplanes?
 How do SAS expanders work and what's the performance? This Dell SAS expander seems to expand to 24 drives and connects to another server for JBOD via a single SFF-8088. Do I get 6G/12G for all 24 drives or what's the best way to connect a full array of hard drives without sacrificing performance?
 How do top loaders like 45Drives or Supermicro's 90 drive top loader serve all of the disks? Do they just have 22 HBAs? How do they ensure full performance?
 I assume SAS3 12G is relevant for faster flash storage – but why is it still relevant when everyone talking about NVMes for best performance nowadays?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now I do my cloud backup to Google Drive Enterprise or whatever it is called these days, and while it works, it has some significant drawbacks. Mainly, it is limited to 750GB upload per day and could go away or not become unlimited at any time. I would like to switch to something more stable where it doesn't feel like I'm just freeloading off of an accounting oversight.
 Given the similar nature of most hoards (ripped blu-rays, youtube archives, linux ISOs, etc), it seems like there should be a way to share backup of a given collection with others, deduplicating and splitting the cost in the process. With B2 and Cloudflare for example, you could do this very cheaply.
 Does any such thing exist? Would you use it if it did?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 Just a question.
 For the past few years while I was studying at the art academy I've been hoarding stuff from public computers people kept around. Best example: we had a scanner classroom with a dozen different scanners for digitalizing film photography and such. People often didn't delete the stuff from the computers after they were done and I collected them. 
 Now I want to start an art project with all these collected files, but I'm not sure if this is allowed. I know from some of them who it was, but most of the time people didn't really add names to their files. I probably can ask the ones that did add their name for permission. But is that even necessary?
 It was stored on public computers, there were no rules about the usage of it all. 
 I also recall artist Sherrie Levine who blatantly copied work of great artists such as Evan Walker, Edgar Degas and Marcel Duchamp. Without asking their permission of course. 
 This might be the wrong sub to ask this, but someone might be able to help me out here.

 And by txt2img I would expect you feed our an image and it tells you in text what it sees and where.
 As for txt2txt you would feed it a book, chapter, paragraph or sentence and it gives you a single word, sentence or résumé paragraph about the text. 
 Maybe you could zoom out of the whole text and apply these résumé as large colored transparent text overlay over the relevant pages so you can get a bird's eye view of an entire text and be able to drill down on areas of interest.
 I've seen the Reddit news article summary bot so I know this exists in some capacity. I'm just hoping to find a self hosted, generalized version of this ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, I need some advice on where to go in my data hoarding/collecting. I currently have a DS214 that I've outgrown with 2 10tb drives in SHR-1 (RAID1). My main use for it is storing photos and videos for my photography work. I'm not accessing the data all the time but typically 1-2 days a week locally only. I'd like to eventually scale this more to increase storage and have a better 3-2-1 plan since, obviously, RAID isn't backup. I'm thinking of using B2 eventually, but I need to solve the local issue first. I have an older (2014 era) custom PC that I can repurpose but am not sure what direction to move in. I would like a better and faster workflow for accessing my photos and I’m working mainly from my Mac currently via the DS214.

 I've got some resource hungry containers that I do NOT need running all the time.

 Or, can I somehow pass a command via a web interface/button to portainer to start/stop a specific container?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 As the title suggests, I'm looking for an alternative for Nginx Proxy Manager. My reasoning for this is I've been using Nginx Proxy Manager for the last 6 months or so, and in that time, I've had multiple instances of it just.. Failing outright. The docker container will be running, but traffic will not flow whatsoever. I've also had issues with SSL certs not renewing, as well as not issuing. I can't keep having my services go down and reverting backups on the main server, rebuilding the container, or having to roll back updates/push new updates constantly to try and fix the problem.
 Recently, I had it fail again, and am unable to get it working whatsoever. I switched back to good old Nginx basic, writing the configs manually and setting it up, and it works fine.
 I'm looking for an alternative with a GUI. I don't want to go back to command line and writing configs manually. I'm just too tired of having to pray that Nginx Proxy Manager will work, or having to roll back to get it working again.
 Please suggest some alternatives with a GUI and ideally docker based as I'm running this on a Windows machine.
 Thanks all!

 Aiseesoft used to have a dvd ripper program that seemed to work ok but it doesn't seem to be on their current product list and their new products seem crazy and complicated.

What's the actual difference between the drives? They have the same name, but the price is different (though the actual difference is negligible - only about the equivalent of 4-5 USD). One has higher RPM but lower read and write speed, plus smaller cache. The other drive is the opposite - lower RPM with higher read and write speed and bigger cache. Also, the first drive is a little heavier. Does anybody know what's up with that?

I do like to get the plan, but 3 users is too much for me and the price for the plan (when getting a license for 3 users) is too high compared to what Google offered with their Enterprise plan and my budget.

 ​
 I came across this subreddit and asked myself the following question. Suppose you want to host e.g. a Nextcloud, Bitwarden, etc. on your own server but have no idea about setting up the infrastructure. Is there a tool (or even a paid service) with which you can deploy the application (+ web server and so on) on your host with just a few clicks without necessarily depending on a provider? All this without additional software and via a frontend that guides me through the necessary steps?
 ​
 I am well aware that you have to take care of the connection from the tool to my host for example. My question is only aimed at the pure deployment or setup of the application.
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[EDIT: [SOLVED, LEAVING UP FOR POSTERITY]
 Hi everyone. 
 Basically I would like to export every reddit comment that I have ever made.
 I have always wanted to write a book, and while most shit I have written on here is drivel, in the six years I've had this account (12 year vet of reddit here) I have experienced and written on the subjects of pandemia, the war in Ukraine, changing economic and social climate in Poland, France, and the United states, art, literature, music; you know, some occasionally good or interesting things.
 I also believe that the observer effect and known intent of wanting to write would, if I revisit these topics, strip away some of the eloquence, grandeur, or rawness from when I originally passionately wrote on these subjects in participation instead of intent to create a larger body of work. 
 So, I would like to export my reddit comments into .txt or something (is epub easy to set up I've no experience with this format but I suspect it would open up some tools to me, please correct me if I am out of date, I deal more in audio and graphics.)
 So, if anyone has any advice, I had performed my due diligence and tried to find things on my own, but so far I haven't turned up anything due to build in limits to reddit that only catalogue the last 1k comments.
 Any help appreciated.

 For the context, in case you have seen it before: SimpleX Chat is the first messaging platform that has no user identifiers, not even random numbers. The messages are e2e encrypted, and the servers and network observers cannot see users' contacts or groups. You can use the servers pre-configured in the apps or host your own.
 What's new in v4:
  
local database encryption with passphrase.
 improved stability of chat groups, file transfers and message delivery.
 you can now use your own WebRTC ICE servers for audio-video calls.
 German language in the interface.
  
See full release announcement for more details.
 Download the apps via the links in our GitHub repo: https://github.com/simplex-chat/simplex-chat#readme.
 Please ask any questions
 You comments, questions and criticism here are very welcome - I will try to answer all the questions!
 Also, we are hosting the event on Discord on October 6, at 6pm UK / 10am PT - the same day when we kick off independent implementation audit - please join via this link to:
  
learn how SimpleX Chat is different and why it provides better meta-data privacy than alternatives,
 hear about future platform development plans,
 ask any questions,
 criticize what we do,
 suggest improvements.
  
Once you install the app you can choose "Connect to developers" to ask any questions, suggest new features and to join the group of users.
 About SimpleX Platform
 Some links to answer the most common questions:
 How can SimpleX deliver messages without user identifiers.
 What are the risks to have identifiers assigned to the users.
 Technical details and limitations.
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc..

 I am constantly getting suggestions to deepen folder structures, to provide more organisation. I want to better understand the pros and cons of this. I would like to say No, because I think users will have more clicking, not necessarily guaranteeing the data hoard is properly filed. But that just sounds like a negative Nancy / pessimistic response.
 Advice?

 When I search for what HDD should I buy, results mostly said I should buy cheap one, but multiple.
 They also talked about bytes per dollar rule and something but, I honestly forgot.
 So…I’m here to asking direct help, again.
 I’m planning to get Terra Master D5-300C DAS, and I use it for storing huge video and image files. Nothing crazy, casual use, I think. Don’t sure if it’s helpful for you to give me advice.

 Currently Iran is blocking the internet mostly, and are trying to do what north korea and china do with their "internet"
 Almost no vpn works, only tor with snowflake connects which is so slow you can only send a text every 30seconds.
 Right now the only thing that I think is working properly are proxies, I don't know much about proxies but some mtproto and socks5 proxies are working on my telegram (they get blocked after a while but we'll use a new one)
 Can you guys provide some guides on how to use proxies for my whole linux and android device, and provide a list of proxies?
 Also a huge thanks to everyone who is sending us their help and prayers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using RaiDrive 2020.6.80 (I use this old version because new ones require payment for the shared drives connection) to connect my main Google Drive enterprise, and also my shared drives. Today, the shared drives do not connect, and it just tells me: Delegation aborted Reason: () GoogleTeamDrive: https://lambda.raidrive.com/v1.1/cloud/GoogleTeamDrive/access_token ->(BadRequest)
 My main enterprise drive still works. But the shared drives not. Also heard from my two people I have given access to shared drives, and set up the same RaiDrive system.
 Anyone else noticed? Could they have “fixed” their loophole of using an old version? Or maybe just a temporary glitch?…
 EDIT: Well for now I switched to using the Google Drive client on those machines aswell. But shame if RaiDrive stopped working.

Is it more worth it to add more SATA ports with the PCIe slot and an expansion card or do I use the slot for a low/mid-tier GPU I have (1060 3gb)? Not sure what would be more worth it. I would be using the GPU mainly for accelerated transcoding, but idk if it’s worth sacrificing the SATA speed on 2 of my hard drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been reading up on various file server options and would really appreciate the sub's input.
 Current setup: Three-node Proxmox HA cluster. TrueNAS Core running virtualized on one Proxmox node with local HBA and disks passed through. Total file storage is only around 5TB.
 Problem: TrueNAS Core is overkill for my current needs. The only features I use are SMB sharing, NFS sharing, snapshots, and offsite backup (using rclone). With HBA pass-through, TrueNAS can't take advantage of HA and it is generally a huge resource hog.
 I'd like to find a lightweight solution that can run completely virtualized (no hardware pass-through) on Proxmox with HA. Stability, SMB/NFS sharing, and offsite backup (I'm looking at restic to replace rclone) are the key features I need. Snapshotting files would be nice, I could give that up if the otherwise ideal solution doesn't support it (and instead snapshot at the disk level in Proxmox). Each of my Proxmox nodes would have plenty of ZFS storage to hold a complete copy of the data. I've looked at openmediavault, Unraid, Ubuntu server, and stripped-down TrueNAS with a virtualized disk - but can't figure out which path to pursue. 
 Hoping someone has been down a similar road and can offer advice. Thanks!

 This app is to prevent any disputes between me and the users during project discussions and on-site communications (e.g. on what user has requested and how they want the task to be done, signed at the end of the day and a report is generated for recording purposes.)
 The report itself needs to have the following information: - Unique running numbers to keep track of the report, something similar to an invoice. - A table that allows me to input the tasks that has been completed. - A signature line for user to sign. - Date & time of task completion in the report.

 tldr at the bottom. 
 Long time lurker here. I was dreaming about a homelab for some time and a few months ago I made the first baby step and bought a Synology DS920+ to have a NAS in general and have a place where I can play around a bit with docker containers to see whether I really like this hobby or not.
 I spent at least a dozen night since having the NAS playing around with my home sandbox to say the least and really like the whole host things for yourself and build a mini "empire" locally. Anyway a long lost child is on the surface again and I enjoy it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to self host a tailscale alternative.. (or similar).
 I've seen a lot of the recommendations but most of them need a fair bit of investment to get them working so i;d like to ask some advice as to which one to sink my time in to..
 What I have : 
  
A VPS with 3x vCPU Core, 25GB SSD RAID-10, 2GB RAM, 3000GB Traffic - 1Gbps Port,1 Dedicated IPv4 Address
 2 Proxmox hosts locally
  
What i'd like : 
 Edit : A web gui!! i need a web gui to administer things!
 A VPN that will allow me to connect in via the VPS (ideally) and access my entire local network. Routinely, i'd be taking down one of my proxmox hosts, so i'd like to host a subnet router or similar on each one so there are failovers should i take one down..
 the VPS should also be able to ping my entire local network (for uptime kuma)
 I'd also like another subnet router for another remote network on a different IP range..
 Tailscale does everything i want on the free tier.. except for having 3 ingress(?) points in to my home network... if i'm not using the correct terminology here or anything else is off.. please tell me..
 Edit : looking at the tailscale documentation they offer a beta feature at the business class level called "subnet router failover" this is pretty much exactly what i'm after.. but you know.. selfhosted and free :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this in r/WireGuard as well, but since r/homelab has a larger membership, I thought I'd see if any of you had any ideas.....
 Ok, so, I have a number of issues trying to keep things running on my external access to my hosted services in my home. All of which come from having to use DDNS and various redirects to get around the ISP port blocking issues. I've been doing this for YEARS, but I've been trying to lighten my load in terms of maintenance on my setup lately as I know depend solely on my own services rather than big tech. 
 All that to ask this....I've been thinking about trying to host a Wireguard server on a Linode instance and basically using it as a pass through for my home network.
 I currently run a UDM Pro and a Raspberry Pi 4 hosting WG for my network.
 That said, has anyone any thoughts on or tried to run a Wireguard Linode (probably Ubuntu 20.04) which in turn hosts a UI VPN connection to their UDM? I know how to get the Wireguard deployed and I'll just use my existing configs for it, but what I'm NOT sure how to do is get the Linode to then connect to my UDM Pro via the UI VPN (I think it's just using OpenVPN, but I'm not sure).
 Anyone have any thoughts or ways to make this work/be better?
 Ultimately, I'd like to have the public IP of the Linode instance be my entry point for all my services (SMTP server, Plex server, and several others that I don't limit to only VPN access), basically making the Linode's IP my public IP.
 Although, now that I'm thinking about it, I could build a pfSense on Linode and then have it host a vpn to which my UDM Pro would connect and then enter a static route in pfSense to bridge the two. That way the UDM would still protect my LAN from the outside world, with the added benefit of being able to add some layers of security in pfSense (maybe even pi-hole).
 Am I making this too complicated? LOL!
 Any help or thoughts would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a HP Z820 Workstation with 128GB RAM and some SSD drives. CPU = Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v2 @ 3.30GHz (2 Sockets). It runs great, but I am selling it as it uses too much power. About 111 watts to 200 watts depending on what it's doing.
 My Goals:
  
Save on my electrical bill (less watts the better) 
 Have a small foot print (Z820 is a beast) 3)Have the power I need
  
I'm looking at 1 of 2 options:
  
Buy an Intel NUC NUC12WSHi5 and place on a shelf in my 18U rack 
 Build a custom Micro ATX system and place it in a Rosewill 2U chassis to fit in my 18U rack
  
Intel NUC Build: 
  
NUC12WSHi5 - $525 
 64GB RAM - $150 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 1TB SSD (Own already) 
 SABRENT 512GB Rocket NVMe PCIe M.2 2242 - $70
  
Micro ATX Build: 
  
ASRock B660M-HDV LGA 1700 Intel B660 SATA 6Gb/s DDR4 Micro ATX Motherboard - $89 
 Rosewill RSV-Z2700U 2U Server Chassis Rackmount Case - $155
 Intel Core i5-12600 - Core i5 12th Gen Alder Lake 6-Core 3.3 GHz LGA 1700 65W Intel UHD Graphics 770 Desktop Processor - BX8071512600 - $230 
 be quiet! SHADOW ROCK LP - $86 
 be quiet! Pure Wings 2, 80mm Fan - $9 
 Seagate Firecuda 520 2TB - $180 
 6TB Mech. HDD - Own 
 500GB or 1TB SSD - Own 
 1TB or 2TB Mech/SSD for Emby? - Own
 Antec Earthwatts Gold Pro Series EA650G Pro 650W Semi-Modular, 80 PLUS GOLD - $99 
 Crucial 64GB Kit (2 x 32GB) DDR4-3200 UDIMM - $165
  
I believe that the NUC will use around 45 watts~ but am not sure about the other build, I know it's dependent on work load but any guess as to how much power it'll use?
 Here's what I do with Proxmox, at the moment:
  
5 out of the 20 VMs run most of the time, the remainders are just for testing, learning, etc. 
 I run a lot of containers, Linux OS's and a couple of Windows OS's 
 The containers are small, mostly web servers, the most intensive ones are TrueNAS and Emby
  
I will have to put a couple hundred into either build after I make the sale on the tower. Thoughts? Advise?

I made a connection group called “networking” under the Root folder but now anything that I add to the networking group just disappears. If I try to make another group under networking the same thing happens, it seems to add without error but then it is not there when I expand the networking group. If I try to make the group again it says the group already exists. 
 Any ideas of what to check? 
 Also does anyone link directly to guacamole sessions? Im hoping to integrate with zabbix using macros to link hosts to a guac connection such as https://guac.my.tld/#/client/{HOST.IP} but it seems like guac uses auto generated strings for the url. Anyone doing something similar?

 - divide de external drive in 2 partitions, one NTFS and the other HFS or 
 - Make it Ex-fat, but it dosnt have the journaling feature, so i dont know if it would be less stable to crash my backups in the future 
 Obs: Fat-32 is not a possibility, since i have files larger then 4gb

 Despite that, i still wanted to opt for a secure setup balancing my technical knowledge and skills, and practical usage.
 Before i started this all, i read up on what other people did and my 'conclusion' was "yeah, i should do that too because that seems right". But lately i am pondering if i should.
 I've created a DMZ network and installed a Treafik Proxy server within it. This proxy will redirect request to the actual application. I've already setup my firewall rules (only allows 80/443, and proxy to my app), the application (on a different VLAN) and even secured the docker socket.

 Edit: i should say rename by date modified, as the dates created are all recent since they were just created on this hdd. Date modified seems to be the day the photo was taken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, 
 I own a QNAP TS-453D with these inside: 
 - 2 x WD red plus 4TB (WD40EFZX) drives in RAID 1 (39-40°C) 
 - 2 x WD black 1TB WD10JPLX drives in RAID 1 (34-36°C) - using these just becase they're standing and doing nothing for the moment. 
 ​
 I'm going remove the WD Blacks and put another two 8TB drives in RAID 1. I'm considering one of these CMR drives: 
 ​
 WD Red Plus WD80EFZZ - 5640 rpm - warranty 3 years - 25/30 dbA - 255 € 
 WD Red Pro WD8003FFBX - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 29/36 dbA - 277 € 
 Seagate IronWolf ST8000VN004 - 7200 rpm - warranty 3 years - 28/32 dbA - 219 € 
 Seagate IronWolf Pro ST8000NE001 - 7200 rpm - warranty 5 years - 28/30 dbA - 265 € 
 ​
 I'm using the NAS for two things only: 
  
Plex/Emby server 
 
PC / phone backup 
 
 ​
 The transfer speed right now is ~110Mb/s (1 Gbit link), which is good enough for me. 
 ​
 The price difference right now is not a deciding factor for me at all. But what matters for me more is: 
  
silence 
 
temperature 
 
longevity 
 
 ​
 The PRO's (WD & SG) both have 5 years of warranty - but, from the specs it would seem that it comes at the cost of drive noise (& higher operating temperatures). 
 ​
 Any suggestions for my situation? >> I'd like to have a quiet (and not to warm) NAS that will be reliable for some time.

 Pretty much as the title say, I'm curious if anybody is self-hosting this? 
 If so, have you followed the guide to open all the required ports
 Open TCP ports 80, 443, 33073, 10000 (Dashboard HTTP & HTTPS, Management gRCP & HTTP APIs, Signal gRPC API respectively) on your server. 
 Or have you found some way to chuck a proxy in front of it?
 Thanks

 That seems like a big jump in price. I'd like to keep my .info domain, so I'm just wondering if there is a better alternative to Google Domains.

 And having Amazon Photos is a nice since it easier to view photos there than on Drive.
 But Drive is shutting down and Photos by itself is no good because the one feature I need to have is the ability to bulk download in the event the service shuts down. I love that Drive has it.
 Does anyone know of any good alternatives that makes it convenient to bulk download in case of an emergency?

 How I imagine that is that you have one client where you can chat and where you also have some kind of dial pad to do sip calls.
 Sofar I wasn't really able to find something that would work like this and the closest thing I found was the old jitsi desktop client which has XMPP and SIP in one application. Which would be perfect if only it wasn't EOL and buggy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have found myself in a position where I need to archive several terabytes of data for long term storage and have begun to seek out an external LTO-5 tape drive since I read this was the start of encryption for LTO tapes as well and I feel encryption is important for the data.
 I really only have a modern windows 11 machine however, and my PCIe x8 slot is blocked by my GPU. I would really prefer not having to find a workaround for this.
 My question is, do PCIe x4 SAS HBA cards with the external ports exist? The LTO-5 drive I am looking to buy is a dual SAS one, so I assume I need one that has 2 external ports? I think that's the kind of card I need, anyway. I am novice.
 I've of course tried to search on my own, but it's difficult for a newcomer with lots of unrelated results.
 Thank you for your consideration.

 I pretend to have a machine running 24/7 as media server, with radarr and sonarr. It will also serve as Plex media server. The las function it will have, is going to be a home assistant server.
 I wonder if it is a good idea to invest in a mini server, a good nas, or what I'm thinking, a nuc with a nas connected through usbC
 The nuc is a nuc11i3, and I think that the most basic nas would do the job, as I only need it as storage. I want to do this because I need to do tone mapping.
 What is your opinion /advice?

 I also want to use my knowledge and server power for good things. Reading about the developments and the cencorship in iran is devastating, but I stumbled across this tweet and this repo by signal to help people in iran get the word out.
 For the signal proxy, they are using nginx and letsencrypt already and the ports 80 and 443. My current setup already involves an nginx proxy as well as a certbot, so how can I host this signal proxy in my infrastructure?
 Some docker and nginx wizards are needed and the help is very welcome! Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years back, I built myself a 50TB server with ZFS and 2 redundant disks. Massive storage beyond my imagination. Of course I have adopted the hoarding ways and now starting to feel the limits.
 I bought a motherboard with a decent number of SATA ports and expanded it with a SAS controller (seemed like a pretty niche piece of hardware!).
 What are my options for further expansion? I think I could maybe add an additional SAS controller on PCI-E by removing my (humble) HTPC-class GPU.
 Are there other consumer-level options for expansion? The case itself also does not really have additional room. Is it possible to add an external array of disks for a 2nd ZFS array without investing in a whole new motherboard/CPU/etc? Is this what iSCSI is, and is there consumer hardware for this? When I look it up I find a bunch of synology expansions arrays.
 Sorry if this is a silly question, I don't exactly know what I should be searching :).

 I am looking for a solution to basically do a NMAP scan every 15-30 minutes on my network and either alert me of new devices or show me the new devices. Same as doing port and host monitoring. 
 Im not sure if librenms will do this for me but i can look into it. 
 Goal:
  
notification of new devices
 web ui
 port mapping
 latency testing
 non-credentialed scans/ credentialed scans
  
Any ideas would be great!

 My current set up consists of a TrueNAS server with ~8TB usable storage and a Plex VM running inside of it, a Raspberry Pi with a VPN server and PiHole installed, and a Dell Optiplex micropc running Docker which currently has Zabbix and Portainer running on it - I definitely plan on upgrading soon, but as the title suggests, I’m looking for some ideas on what else I would like to run.
 Some ideas for the future: Graphana; some sort of camera managing software for a future security system (found an open source option which looks great but can’t remember the name off the top of my head) and a backup solution that would backup servers to TrueNAS.
 Anyway, what are you people in this subreddit running currently and is there anything you would suggest I take a look at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to figure out how to manage access for internal servers running various web apps. (It is important to note that neither these apps nor servers are exposed to the public Internet.) In the past, I have relied on unsigned certificates or even no certificates. However, I am starting to see apps that will not work in either of these configurations and web browsers that are becoming increasingly unhappy about unsigned certificates.
 I get that there are risks with unsigned certs, but these are tightly controlled apps inside my LAN and so I am less concerned. I am familiar with letsencrypt and use that for external facing apps. But all of these servers are internal only and so an external CA makes little sense.
 Any advice on how to handle this?
 TIA!

 The issue is as follows, A1 and A3 show as bad memory channels.
  
swap A1 and A2, while swapping A3 and A4. still shows as bad memory in channels A1 and A3.
  
So this tells me that either the r630 motherboard or CPU1 is faulty. 
  
Swapped CPU1 and CPU2. Still shows as memory channels A1 and A3 are faulty.
  
So this tells me the motherboard is faulty.
  
Buy r730xd barebones and install my cpus, memory, hba, and nic. didn't install in any order grabbed cpu and memory at random. Shows A1 and A3 faulty. repeated steps 1 and 2 with r730xd. Is it likely that I got 2 motherboards with faulty dimms slots/traced on the exact same dimms? I would lean to cpu but swapping them on both servers didnt move the error.

 This is a problem for remote access as well as a service I use that needs to send webhooks to a local server. 
 I set up a Wireguard server on my VPS, setup a tunnel between my firewall at home (PFSENSE) and the VPS, and then I used nginx proxy manager "Streams" to forward the port I need for webhooks to the local host at home
 Now no matter what the internet is doing at home, it will always be able to connect through the tunnel and back to the server
 Now, I want to get a remote access VPN working. I have OpenVPN setup on PFSENSE which works very well for me. I figured I could just do the same and "Stream" 1194 back to the firewall, but it doesn't connect. 
 Has anyone gotten this to work?
 I would just use Wireguard on the VPS, but the outbound internet in Linode is not great, a lot of services are blocked by third party companies from Linode IP's, and the DNS config in OpenVPN is much better than Wireguard and everything in my home network "Just works" via OpenVPN, not so much with Wireguard

 There's been alot of posts around hosting signal proxies to support Iran. My question is it going to really help? I want to help anyway I can and if a signal proxy will genuinely help I'll do it, but iv read conflicting information saying VPNs are needed more. 
 I don't know anyone in Iran so not sure I'd want to host a VPN for anyone to use.

Without boring you all with the detail, it took me quite a while to get SSL working on a local intranet via nginx. I am tempted to migrate to a docker container of nginx or caddy, but what I have is also working.
 Who's using what now a days? Caddy seems more... recent in its featureset and development. Is it easy enough to deploy?

 I created a home server to essentially replace and finally get rid of Google's storage forever, and all was going so well until i realised I needed to constantly update my records with my current public IP since my public IP is dynamic.
 Well, when doing this, I found that Cloudflare blocked API use for my domain name, a .tk free domain, for unknown reasons (all i could find relating to this error on Google were just screams of help and no resolutions whatsoever) and now I'm just stuck here confused at how I can have my domain still running effectively without having it drop due to the ISP's IP cycling.

 I'm sharing a nice 1-line command that prints docker network name and it's IP (Gateway's IP strictly speaking). See below.
 ​
 Long version
 Problem: in AdguardHome I see all these IPs that are coming from docker containers. I'd like to see which containers. Turns out it's not that straightforward to clearly see what container produces what network at which IP range. (at least not with a simple docker command).
 So, I went on a and wrote a lengthy nodejs script that would loop through docker networks finding these IPs and nicely print them for me.
 Then I realised that there must be an easier way.
 The Bash way.
 So here is the final version of a day's work. Maybe it will help someone save the time :-)

 The command
 (echo "NAME GATEWAY"; docker network inspect $(docker network ls --format="{{.ID}}") --format="{{.Name}} {{(index .IPAM.Config 0).Gateway}}" 2> /dev/null) | column -t -s " "

 Does anyone have recommendations? I want to be able to reboot that computer on a schedule and still have the DNLA service run when the computer is back online.

 I'm not trying to boot onto the hard drive or anything, just plugged it in for the first time, and am still booting off of the SSD. My assumption now is that my old 450 watt power source doesn't have enough power for it, so it's just causing the power to go off after a second. Any other ideas what might be causing this? Could an incorrectly plugged in drive cause this? I don't see why it would cause it to power off immediately unless it's trying to draw too much power.

Both my vikunja and npm are in their own docker-compose.yml files, and they are bridged with a docker network.

 I have 10 8TB drives I want to use. From what I've read, I would likely want to use 8 of the drives for data and 2 for parity. I would use DrivePool (without duplication) to essentially make a big 64TB drive (at least that's how the pool would present in Windows, right?), and then configure Snapraid to use the 2 remaining disks as parity disks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So far my understanding is:
  
Pay for a line to be built (2mile road to nearest fiber conn) 
 
Continue paying for data which throttles at 150GB ($2/GB) 
 
Use my phone hotspot (which also throttles at 50GB) 
 
Rent office space? I can't find any near me
 
 Any other ideas? The satellite provider is the best in the area. The speed is good, but the data caps are killing me. I start sweating when I see Slack or another JavaScript website download 20MB+. All those little things add up. Not to mention I work heavily in microservices with docker containers which easily exceed a 100MB in some cases. 
 I've considered asking neighbors on the hillside across from me to allow me too setup some sort of antenna array. Maybe we can get the internet from the nearest cell tower? Not sure how that would work. And since my provider throttles me back to 2G speeds (256kbps), I'm pretty sure cell towers are a bust. 
 The nearest library is nice but it's only open some days and for limited hours. Often closed before the end of business or open well past most of my meetings. 
 Am I stuck with Starbucks? 
 I'm a bit of a newbie when it comes to the infrastructure side of things. Anyone have any experience with rural internet conditions? How do you solve your data cap issues?

 Question for anyone who knows Wireguard.
 I have a VPS, it runs the docker container wg-easy, works great. At home I have a PFSENSE Firewall, I configured the wireguard tunnel with the VPS as the server, and I can get traffic over to the VPS via Wireguard with no problem, speeds are great
 My question is, how do I get the traffic to work the other way? Do I need to add some static routes?
 I read this guide:https://hacdias.com/2020/11/30/access-network-behind-cgnat
 That does not mention static routes, so I'm not sure how that exactly works.
 Second question would be, I see that in this guide there is PostUp and PostDown configurations for WireGuard, if I look at the conf for wg-easy, it only has PostUp. Do I need the PostDown?

I'm likely going to pair it with either Xeon E-2336 or E-2314 (I know the latter is plenty but I'm a sucker for some extra cores for those unlikely what-if scenarios...)
 - How's the BIOS/UEFI like? Do the server-boards have a similar fan control to consumer gear? This is important in a sense that I'm aiming to build a near silent setup. Not sure whether I'll succeed with a 2U though.
 - Any comments about the ASUS ASMB10-iKVM, is it any good?
 - Any cons using the on-board ethernet for pfSense? I've got a separate 2x10GbE Intel PCIe NIC too.
 - Other gotchas that you wish you'd known before jumping to server boards?

 https://i.imgur.com/6F4qFHo.png
 https://i.imgur.com/D0dJhvC.png
 But I'm not really getting the desired results. I'm getting notifications whenever anything new is posted there. Even if I put free and 100% in extracting text, I'd get like 3-4 lines with either 100% or free, which is correct, but when new stuff is posted this extracted 100% or free gets moved around and it triggers new notifications.
 What I really want is compare snapshot x(now) to y(old), if new line or new text with 100% or free appears AND is different to snapshot y THEN trigger.
 Not if it moves around, not if it's the same as before.
 A current snapshot looks like that: https://i.imgur.com/bbC5d8q.png
 The diff looks like this and still triggers notifications: https://i.imgur.com/5xnNoQp.png, even though I have checked "new lines" and triggers set to new/100%, I guess moving the lines with "new" and "100%" equals "new lines" which is why it triggers.

 I'm planning out my first media stack (rough thoughts: https://imgur.com/a/A5hqOH5)
 Two specific questions, in order of priority:
  
How should I set up my VPN such that it's only routing traffic from certain services (i.e. the -arr stack and the like) and not from others? 
 If you see the diagram above, should the red arrow be there or is this a misunderstanding?Should all traffic route through the reverse proxy?
 In the described use-case above, how should I set up my VPN? Wireguard on the VM, or gluetun or something else?
 
 Any advice about pros / cons in running k3s / microk8s on VM (proxmox) or bare-metal?
  
Thanks in advance for your help!

I noticed that the Bitwarden extensions and apps cannot synchronise anymore when I put the URL behind CF Access. Most likely, the sync agent just gets redirected to the cloudflare login panel, which prevents it from actually syncing anything.
 I'm using Authelia and Bitwarden's inbuilt security so it's no huge deal, but would be nice if this could somehow still be behind Access as well - redirecting attacks to cloudflare instead of my own server alleviates some of the risks involved and a password manager has to be very well secured imo. 
 If anyone got ideas on how to tackle this, please LMK!

 If you subbed to too many channels to create a list manually: create a Google Takeout for the youtube profile you're using, set the smallest archive size. The first archive will contain a CSV with subscriptions.

 What i have found out so far:
 Aio didnt really work because i dont want to expose nextcloud (instead access via nextcloud.local)
 Snap is pretty limited in therms of options. Also docker versions seems to have better performance than the other ones.
 What are the benefits of each one?

 I have two APC R2000 Rack-Mount UPS's for my HomeLab that appear to be completely dead. No output, no lit LED. Checked with known good batteries (from 3rd UPS). I've checked for (visibly) blown components, and confirmed that power makes it past the main circuit breaker.
 I'd like to find someone in the Boston/MA/US region that I can pay $$$ to repair. I can deliver and retrieve, they are too heavy to ship, so I'd like to find someone in the region.
 Thank you for any recommendations.

Obviously I am going to be needing a bit more storage space than the 240GB M2 SSD that's already in there. For my intents and purposes I expect to be needing about 10 TB of space. I have already settled for SSDs as opposed to HDDs because of various factors (biggest ones being power and noise) and I am currently working on a plan to integrate them into a flexible system of drives. Since the Nuc I plan on getting only supports one more 2.5" drive I am going to have to come up with solutions to connect the drives externally. I have been researching for many hours now on how that would look like if I want to keep the total cost as low as possible and I have come u…]]></summary>

 But to avoid falling into the same trap of trying to develop the perfect solution from the get-go before starting the actual collection and never actually starting the project because I got overwhelmed, I'm looking for the best "starting" solution that lets me expand later.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I have a rather large video library (none of it personal videos) it's all made Movies and Series so I can replace it if I have to, though it would be inconvenient.
 I just filled up my 4th 5tb (because they're portable) drive and currently the prices are a bit rediculous, so I'm gonna be stuck with what I have for a few months. I have two 500gb drives, which is barely large enough for anything. i wanted to merge it into a Spanned Volume so that I'd have a 1tb drive.
 My question if one fails then what happens to my data. As i said, I can replace the series, since I got them all from the internet or by backing up my DVD collection, so I don't mind it but it would be inconvenient.
 Since it's just series, performance isnt much of a concern, as long as the shows play smoothly, I'd be happy.
 Also would it ware my drives out faster. They're pretty old, both are almost 8 years old, though they haven't seen much use. It's just 500GB's each so I don't mind them breaking in a few years but until the prices of the 5tb's in my country come down a bit, I don't want to replace them.
 Thanks

I have had my drives for about one and a half year on a server that is has very little accessed and I can se the Load_Cycle_Count is already above 45K!! Now I am terrified that these drives will start dying on me. 
 I have these on a Linux system and I am not sure about what to do. I figure I need to install the SeaChest/openSeaChest tool and change some parameters. Does anyone know how to install the tool on Linux and which parameters I need to change? I have the drives set up in a ZFS 2 x mirrored vdev configuration. Are the operations I need to do with the SeaChest tool safe while the drives are in normal operation in the ZFS pool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been steadily accumulating video, photo and audio data, as well as project files as long as I've had a computer. My hobbies have led me to take photos on family/friend holidays, special occasions, press shots for people, footage of music videos/live events, downloaded song library for DJing, the list goes on.
 Anxiety warning - until recently this data was sprawled across a collection of relatively unprotected internal hard drives, old USB thumb drives, external drives, memory cards and my current and past machines. I took it upon myself to consolidate this data on one external drive and have since mostly organised it. For the task I chose a WD 12TB My Book external drive, of which I bought two.
 Question - I want to sync the two 12TB external drives through my Windows 10 machine, I'll call them A and B.
 After an initial carbon copy of the two drives, the dream is to easily update the B drive now and then with any additions or organisation changes that I make on my A drive, automatically (after plugging both drives into the computer), without having to remember the file pathways for each change or addition.
 I have been informed by some lovely folk over at r/Archiveteam that shucking these enclosures and building a NAS system could be an option for me, but I would like to explore any ideas people had that didn't involve buying more hardware. 
 Would appreciate any advice on this, thank you in advance!

 Do I just copy them over (after zipping them or something) to another drive? Do I use a backup software, like rsync or Bacula? I don't understand much about the redundancy thing with Raid and I also don't have the drives or the budget for drives to support it, like some people do.
 My media is mostly movies/shows but there's also smaller files, images, books, etc.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the mods, this is not advertisement nor selling, just asking. well it very sounds like some hustle, but let me tell you.
 I’m korean (south, obviously), and the thing is, recently one of the biggest filecoin mining pool here has been liquidating their equipments. 
 They said most of their disk’s uptime is average 5000-10000h, manufactured in early 2021, I/O barely happened (they have been ‘floating’ as term in filecoin)
 So I thought, “Well, so they’re basically dumping pre-tested HUGE hard drives (datacenter grade even)?”
 So I bought 2 WD HC530 14TB drives and currently waiting for my PERC H310 to come in order to connect SAS drives.
 I've bought dozens of these liquidation deals time to time, and I can tell you these are the good one. almost new. dustless, no scratches.
 And the second thing to tell you is, since current currency rate is very low for korean won, these are even cheaper in dollars. so I thought “Well, maybe I can sell these to datahoarders?”
 So here I am. Anyone interested? I think even including shipping rate these are cheapest price I guess? for the WD HC550 18TB, 200$, and WD HC530 14TB is 160$. These are used, not refurbished.

Standard model, ships in 512e format, Fast Format allows either 512e or 4Kn sector size 
  
and dont know what it means. is this a feature i should be looking for, or something for compatibility? 
 fyi im running a zfs filesystem on my truenas scale server using mainly repurposed desktop components. i am currently using smallish ironwolf drives but my next pool is going to be a mirror of something like 2 x 12+TB drives and i dont want to buy until i understand this feature.
 thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a domain for exclusively personal use. My email service is properly set up with SPF/DKIM/DMARC etc (it gets 10/10 on mail-tester.com).
 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I'm completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a "bad" reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Came across this coverage by chance on Google News.
 I'm currently using the M-Disc for archiving video and naturally this sounds very interesting to me (even M-Disc fiends don't enjoy spreading their data across lots of 25 GB disks).
 From what I can decipher reading the interview:
  
They're intending to produce 10 TB optical disks. Which would naturally be a huge breakthrough given optical's traditional low capacity (and hence its poor economics vs. LTO for business archival needs - not to mention, of course, the cloud).
 Re: drive pricing their CEO says that they will be positioned "somewhere between" Blu Ray drives and LTO drives. Which is actually pretty unspecific given that there's currently a few thousand USD between the two price points.
 The high capacity promised is being achieved by storing the data across multiple layers. As my knowledge of optical media manufacturing remains basic I'll leave it at that.
  
What I didn't see in the coverage (if I'm not mistaken): specifics about how they intend manufacturing for archival specifically. Assuming we're talking about the traditional optical media form factor, does this involve replicating M-Disc's inorganic pitting "secret sauce" or, perhaps, some new proprietary tech?
 I'd be interested to hear from other folks interested in using optical for backup as to:
  
How optimistic you are about this project?
 Whether if they were to pull this off, you could see optical displacing LTO in business archival and (to a far lesser extent if we're talking WORM) backup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am running into and am too stupid to figure it out on my own. I've tried reading google, no one wants to dumb it down for me.
 Scenario: I have Ubuntu Desktop on VMware. I have multiple users for me and 2 friends so we can share the vm. I am installing xrdp so we can all remote in wherever we are (already have vpn up and running).
 We all use windows as our daily drivers because it's easy and what we grew up on. We will all be using RDP to get in.
 It works fine on my account after enabling the remote desktop bs in settings. Cannot get it to work at all on the other accounts despite all of them having the same settings. 
 Don't know what I'm doing wrong. Please educate me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I recently discovered Dr. John Campbell's YT channel, and in one of his more recent videos he mentioned that he recently received a strike against his channel for proliferating misinformation. If you're familiar with his content, he's been speaking a lot about Covid, vaccination, excess deaths, and pretty much anything Covid related since he's a retired nurse teacher. He has about 2,100 videos and it's a wealth of medical information. I suspect his channel won't be around for long, since he's been talking a lot about some inconvenient data. If you've ever watched any of his content, you'd know he's extremely prudent, factual, informative, and just an all around brilliant Youtuber and medical professional. If his channel receives the ban hammer, there would be thousands of medically informative videos and millions of views wiped off the platform in an instant. The point of this post is not to invite contentious debate surrounding the topics that he discusses, but to raise awareness about his channel if any of you big hoarders out there want to grab his stuff. I'm thinking about letting YT-DLP grab his channel at 480p. If anyone has it, can you tell me how much space I'm looking at? Thank you.

 I'm rebuilding my server, while adding more features, moving away for it being just a nas box plus a docker host, it will give me the ability to host vms have software raid etc.
 My 2 options were proxmox, and freenas, having worked with the first, the continuous pop-ups about buying licenses, plus the inability to manage network shares on its own, it's a turn off, even if it has a very straightforward way for managing VMs.
 Now, freenas, seems tailored made to act like a nas, with vms feeling like a afterthought, for example, I cannot find a way to have a vm obtain a IP Address from my network's DHCP server, only behind NAT.(on proxmox this was a simple toggle called bridge connection) Documentation on this, imply that bridges are for link aggregation. (https://www.truenas.com/docs/core/coretutorials/network/interfaces/bridgecreate/). If there are any solution to this, I'll be more than happy to to give freenas a go.

 For an internal workflow and data management tool I am looking for the best software. I will most likely use a Postgres Database and would prefer a free project.
 So far I looked at Budibase, Appsmith and Tooljet, of which discarded Budibase for it's weird and non-intuitive UI.
 I wondered what other users think about usability and suitable use cases.
 Thank you so much for giving me an insight into your projects, I highly appreciate it!

 The problem is that sometimes there are power surges in my area, so I'm looking into getting a UPS for my network, preferably a single one.
 I've got 1 router, 2 switches and a server that I know that I can use IEC C13/14 to connect to the UPS directly. Then I have 4/5 devices (RPis, network disks, etc) that have their own power transformer (idk if this is the correct terminology), and my question is that if I just get an adapter from C to C13 for each device (1:1 to UPS) or maybe merge them (if possible? to save output ports) since they're lower powered devices. Or is there a better way to do this?

I've long hosted a small Invidious instance for myself and a few other folks, but I have been making some changes lately and wanted to see what the most current wisdom on this front was. Thanks!

 Is there a functional difference between creating a single max size volume vs creating multiple smaller sized volumes as needed? 
 Also can I get a quick run down on partition vs volume vs allocation size?

 I am looking to add more extended battery systems, but am out of rack space to mount them. I have an additional rack available 6~ feet away, but the cables from battery to battery connections are too short. Would DYIng these extension cables work?
 I've got a setup on a 42u rack, with the bottom 12u filled up with a cyberpower PR1500RTXL2U and 5x BP48VP2U02 extended batteries. These extended battery modules come with a little short green-black-red cable (ie, visible here) : https://marvel-b1-cdn.bc0a.com/f00000000057284/www.cyberpowersystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BP48VP2U02_B-768x768.jpg
 Has anyone ran into a problem like this and solved this? Since this UPS setup supports the NVR system, the more power-outage run-time I have, the better. I wonder if anyone has had any experience with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am an amateur photographer mostly focusing on wildlife photography but occasionally help out other with events. I am currently self hosting my storage solutions using truenas in a VM that is not exposed remotely. I am looking for some software solutions for the following tasks: 
  
Remote uploading photos from wherever I am. I would like to be able to make backups easily. Deduplication would be nice feature here. This would need security but I believe nginx can handle that.
 File download if someone has a link, username, and password ( does not have to be super secure but ddos protection would be nice). To share files with people and event organizers when relevant. Zipping would be nice
 Basic file/directory exploration. I would like to be able to share a single photo with people or see if I have a photo of a particular bird species .
  
What I have tried:
  
Libre photos does not seem to have upload or download tools and not directory structure
 Next cloud seems to be a lot more that I need and doesn't seem to play nice with truenas for me at least accessing existing files.
 Currently I manually make zip files for sharing and link them in html tag for download but that can be time intensive
  
I would prefer FOSS but I am willing to talk if it's cheap enough. This is all hobby work.

 Question is will an R730 fit in this threaded rack where the depth between the front and back threads is 27.5” (69.85cm)? I found I need to buy the Dell 331-0166 2U PKCR1 2CGTG Threaded ReadyRail Adapter kit to made this work which I’m willing to do but now worried that it’s too shallow for the rails to properly click in and seat the server?
 I don’t care if it sticks out of the back past the rack, I don’t have a back cover. I’m new to this and just want to make sure before I invest in the adapter kit and rails that it’ll slide in there properly. 
 I have a PE 2950 III as well I plan to rack so I’ll need two kits if anyone has one to sell! 
 Thank you!

 It's essentially a multithreaded Python script that takes Discord images (e.g. Midjourney or any channel) and sends the full high-resolution version of the image automatically to Amazon S3 storage (creates thumbnails as well) and also auto-uploads each image as a new post (along with all the details) into the WordPress website. This is where either you (as an author) or people (if you share it with the online community) can see the image collection process in real-time (as the archiving process takes place).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I've been slowly building up my lab from having a single 6-core server to also having a few older generation NUCs and a laptop. With that, I wanted to move from a single docker deployment (using Portainer) to using kubernetes, since I really don't care which node is running which app, as long as it gets the job done.
 Now, I've installed Proxmox in all of the smaller machines and I absolutely love it - it's really easy to manage and configure, and I like being able to see the whole cluster in one view. 
 So my questions are: 
 1) Would adding k8s controller + nodes as VMs have much of a performance penalty compared to just running k8s directly on those machines? 
 2) Would I even feel the difference taking into account the services I run? (*arr, nextcloud, paperless, plex, password manager, outline, and a bunch of other smaller ones).
 3) Would one of those options give me an easier time with maintenance, backups, etc?
 4) Would one be better in case I need to scale my infrastructure up, create new nodes?
 Hopefully some of you might have experience with these topics and might be able to help me out. Sorry if some of those questions are basic, I wasn't able to get conclusive answers on the web.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are NAS drives rated to be turned on/off daily? Instead of RAID 1 on my desktop and backing up to external drives, I'm thinking of building a nas server to remove clutter in my workspace. However, I only do weekly backups and might run a media server for 1-3 hours like 2-3 times a week. I would rather have 6-8 drives turned off for 95% of the time instead of unnecessarily idling consuming (relatively insignificant) power and undergoing wear and tear.
 I've come across some comments like "NAS isn't intended to be turned on/off" or vague comments such as "they aren't rated for that" but AFAIK NAS drives are like regular drives just rated for more durability. I don't see how it would hurt them to turn them on/off the way you would for regular drives in a deskop PC.
 Also, is it possible to selectively turn/off drives, preferably remotely, in a NAS server? For example, I might want to back up drives and it will only involves 1-2 drives out of say 8 total and I would rather not have 6-7 drives running for no reason, even idle.

 ​
 Just asking if there's already an existing tool, it would be nice to have something where I can have a threshold of how many stars each repository has.
 ​
 I already did most of the work and I can continue using my method, but I'm just asking if there's something that already exists and is maintained.
 ​
 Here are the steps I took:
 I've downloaded all the logs in 2 methods
  
using the API on https://www.gharchive.org/ `wget https://data.gharchive.org/20{15..22}-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz`, it actually ended up being 800GB which is insane
 the other way is to use google cloud platform BigQuery, I downloaded a CSV of users which was almost the size of 300MB CSV file
  
now that I have these, I can then use github api to get their repositories.

 I read that SMB is pretty unsecure. Is there an SMB alternative that is more secure?
 Also having a Web GUI would be cool since I don't have any DE installed.

 The software would need to run on Samsung Smart TV, PS3, mobile devices etc.

The DAS will be connecting to an HP ProDesk 600 G6 Mini which is running as a Plex server / Home Assistant server, and which supports USB C 3.1 Gen 2 (or USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 as HP like to call it!). It doesn’t support Thunderbolt. The DAS won't be moving to any other computers at any time, staying connected to the server.
 I don’t want to add extra stress to the server (i3-10300T and 32gb DDR4-2667 but runs 24/7 for HA) so I’m thinking hardware RAID, and because I’ll be running at least four drives I want RAID 5 support. I can’t fit a RAID card in the ProDesk 600 G6 min…]]></summary>

 Currently I have a home server that I'm running a few services on and exposing some of these (nextcloud, bitwarden etc) to the internet via a cloudflare tunnel and routing internal traffic through nginx proxy manager.
 I've been having a play with some cloud based servers lately, mainly just as a testing ground for projects. I was wondering if it is possible, or even if there would be any security benefits to point my domains/cloudflare tunnel to the cloud server and then route the traffic via a tunnel or VPN connection in to my home server from the cloud server?
 If this is possible and there is an advantage in it please could someone help out with some info on what software/setup you used?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have an HP envy laptop with i7-10510U and 16gb ram and 500GB SSD (even has a discrete 250MX nvidia GPU).
 It is currently mostly unused, I was running proxmox on it for some time with a few VMs and containers, but currently thinking of migrating to TrueNAS Scale, the obvious problem with a laptop that there are no sata ports (or expandability in general is very limited).
 So in order to really benefit zfs and use it as a proper NAS, the only way it seems is using some sort USB enclosures/dockings for SATA HDDs/SSDs, but I'm not sure if that's a decent option.
 Note: there's a USB-C port which can act as a display port / charging / data - perhaps there are some things for storage I can plug in there as a more reliable alternative to "just regular" USB-A ports?
 Note2: The data stored on it is not super critical, mostly family photos and some movies etc. and I'm backing up automatically to Backblaze anyway, so things like ECC memories and edge cases are not really a concern.
 Alternative option:
 I have a tower gaming PC which is running pretty much 24/7 anyway, so I could through in a bunch of HDDs, and run TrueNAS scale in hyper-v. Though that leaves the laptop without a purpose really, and it has more than decent hardware for a home server.
 What do you suggest?
 Thanks

 Price is right imho and once installed crystal disk says they have been powered on 2 times with 4 hours of run time and no errors. Seems legit? I am thinking of adding them into my NAS and building a new set based of 12TB drives with maybe 3 more for a total of 5. Am i missing something or should I check something else before buying more?

 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 ​
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. 
 I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. 
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into " nsfw" territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?
 We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.
 Thanks in advance!

 I’ve got my hands on two older desktops which I want to use as a NAS, and for labbing around with in vm’s and such. (Possibly also a BlueIris NVR)
 Pc’s are both running i7-4790’s and have 32GB of 1600Mhz DDR3. Both machines have 256gb of SATA SSD and 128GB of PCI SSD (dont ask about the PCI i dont know either) One also has a Quadro K4000 and the other a Quadro K4200
 Ive also got access to 6x 2TB WD Black Enterprise drives, with 4 being already installed in one machine and 2 sitting cold, as well as the odd 1TB HDD sitting as storage in the other machine
 I’ve and have played with Proxmox on these, but not sure if I have enough power to run or if its overkill for what I want to be doing - eg if TrueNAS will be sufficient
 Not sure how well Plex & BlueIris NVR will go on the hardware due to being virtualised and being on the older side. 
 Would love some opinions! PFA of my dusty and cable mess of new projects! (don’t worry will be cleaned soon)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After having many issues with flash drives over the years, I have recently reverted back to using optical media for backup/ archival purposes. Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. 
 I've found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. 
 I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I'm working on periodically. 
 I've had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them. I use SSDs instead.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was "stored" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)
 I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?
 Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.
 I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical
 (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)
