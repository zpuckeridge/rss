        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently configured NPM in environment via the Docker image and love it! It is great. I also installed Crowdsec not too long ago and love that too. Now, I am realizing that while the two should work together, they do not because the default NPM image does not include any crowdsec stuff.
 It seems that two people have created forked Docker images (1, 2) with Crowdsec installed, and I am debating switching. However, I hate to change and worry about long-term support. 
 Is anyone using either of them? Does anyone else have a better strategy to add Crowdsec to NPM? As an alternative, should I build an LXC container with NPM and Crowdsec to solve all this?
 I am open for any suggestions. TIA!

However, on windows notepad obviously it doesn’t display the emojis. What text reader is on the iPhone and is there anything similar for windows to allow viewing the WhatsApp chat with emojis like they show in the iPhone text viewer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright, so I've got a 2013 Mac Pro trashcan running ESXI. It seemed like a good idea, I could upgrade the CPU (12 core/24 thread), I could upgrade the RAM (currently 32GB, I could get up to 128GB if I wanted), and I could upgrade the SSD (512GB Gen 3 NVME).
 But ESXI just isn't stable, even though the 2013 Mac Pro is totally on VMware's list of supported devices. (Running ESXI 7U3, ESXI 8 runs but it doesn't support the built-in ethernet ports and I don't feel like buying a Thunderbolt to PCI enclosure and another NIC.)
 I've been running Ubuntu Server 22.04 as a VM in ESXI. Gave it 4 cores and 8GB of RAM. Used the minimal install of Ubuntu Server. Only things I installed was Docker (manual install, didn't use the Snap). Had PiHole & Unbound running as my DNS.
 Well, I ran sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade today, and something borked the Ubuntu VM. Borked it so bad, ESXI couldn't stop the VM. Eventually tried rebooting the Mac Pro, and then ESXI didn't want to boot either.
 Thinking long and hard about going back to just a bare metal Ubuntu install. ESXI was fun to play with, but either this isn't the machine to run it on (even though it says it is supported) or it isn't the hypervisor for me.
 REGARDLESS.
 PiHole + Unbound in Docker on Ubuntu has always felt a little sluggish. Not sure if there's any flags I can add, any variables I can set that would make it run faster, maybe allocate more resources to it versus what Docker gives it by default?
 I think PF Sense is something a lot of people here like and there's a PiHole like add on for that? Are there any other ideas or equivalents or better ways to run this combo?

(A series of mistakes, I'm aware, but it all seemed like a good idea at the time).
 The process is deceptively simple if you've never actually tried to go through it - either download single files directly, or select what you need and prepare a .zip to download later.
 The first thing you'll run into is the 500GB limit for a single .zip - a pain since it means you need to split up your data, but not an unr…]]></summary>

 I'm looking for a webui tool to manage my music folder.
 My idea is something like that:
 - I tell the program where I will add new songs (like the rip folder)
 - It automatically detect new songs, search for tags and the move the song to the correct folder
 - from the webui I set the rules and edit metadata if needed.
 ​
 Do you know anything that can do that?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a small setup with 3 ESXi hosts, vCenter and a NAS handling the data. I have HA setup between the three hosts. Maybe 15 Linux VMs. 
 A recent vCenter update crippled vCenter. I have a backup and can work to get it set back up, but I’m wondering if I should put in the work to rebuild vCenter, or should I take that time to move to something else? 
 I pay for VUMG, moving to something free would be nice but not a deal breaker. 
 I rely on the VMs but the hypervisor is just a hobby. I don’t need to know one system over another for work. It’s just fun. 
 In 2023, if i we’re starting from scratch, what should I be using? 
 Thanks for the advice!

I have one directory with about 5 tb in it, and it takes a while to open (I'm currently using a small nas with 4 drives in raid 10) I'm not sure if this is just the nature of the beast or if there's something else I should be doing to mitigate this. It's also a few directories deep. Is it better to keep large directories closer to root or does it not matter? Thanks in advance.

 I currently have about 1.3TB stored in Amazon Drive. With the retirement of that platform, I am looking to move to a new on-line option. I am currently thinking Google Drive may be the best fit at the best price.
 Looking ahead to the data migration piece.... Can someone suggest options that would allow me to transfer these files directly from the Amazon to the Google platform? Downloading and re-uploading will be a very s l o w p r o c e s s with my internet provider.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just a funny story and a small reminder to properly handle your drives on disposal (not that I think anyone here would be this dumb). 
 I grabbed a cheap used NAS online to upgrade me from running my drives in a regular RAID box. I didn't need to do it so I wasn't looking to spend a lot of money. Got a good deal, showed up with drives in it. Default admin passwords. 
 I have all the data once belonging to a construction company, covering every aspect of their business, going back to at least 2013. Including proposals, diagrams, pictures of their work, addresses, invoices, receipts, credit card numbers, scans of deposited checks, and checking account info. Apparently someone named Katrina decided the recycling bin was good enough. 
 Luckily for them, I am not an asshole. But holy hell does this make me feel better about my overly cautious way of dealing with old drives.

 I've accumulated enough networking stuff to consider rack mounting my things now, and for part of this I'd like to water cool my parsec server in a 2u case (mainly to save u space). I'm currently looking at this case and it seems doable if the hard drive cage is removable. I'd have my graphics card on a horizontal riser and a NIC on another riser towards the rear right of the case. Has anybody done this before that has thoughts? Currently the build exists as a motherboard box test bench.
 Also potentially in the market for a budget short 4u nas case if people have recommendations

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 As the title suggests, I'm looking for recommendations on a Remote Access web client. Below will be some hopeful features I'd like to have if possible. Obviously, I want to self host this. Either through a Windows machine, or Docker would be idea. I can also run this on Linux or a Raspberry Pi if needed.
 Features:
 - Multi-user login (the ability to set multiple user accounts up)
 - Web client (able to access this via a web page, log in, and then choose the machine I want to remote into, kind of like Google Remote Desktop)
 - File sharing is a benefit, but not needed by any means
 I understand this may not exist or be very difficult to find, but this would be the most ideal remote access client for me to use. I currently use Rustdesk but I need to give multiple users access to certain machines, both windows and linux based, and a web client would be the easiest form with multiple user accounts I'd think. Please suggest some options if possible!
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i've been looking around quite some time now and i cant seem to find something, so i am asking you guys. I need to find an e-book Management Software / Reader, which matches these requirements:
  
open source and self hosted
 syncs your reading status accross all devices
 works on iOS and Android (and Windwos perferably, but WSA would also be fine, i guess) for offline reading
 easy to use (Mother-proof)
  
Basically i want Kindle, but without Amazon.
 For audiobooks i use audiobookshelf, which does all of these things perfectly and comes with its own app and web-app, which - as a neat sideeffect - also look really good. I have something similar in mind and considering, that ebooks are around for like 30 years i surely must have missed something.
 Hope you guys can help me, maybe someone has something running, that works just fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm setting up a new server with Proxmox, an Ubuntu VM with Portainer, and an OpenMediaVault VM which has 2 14tb drives in a ZFS mirror attached to it through a virtual hard disk using ~13tb. My Portainer server needs to access the storage, so I set up a single shared folder in OMV and created a volume to access it through NFS. I had assumed each container that I created would add a directory under that NFS share that it would use (ex. /app/pihole). I started setting up containers only to realize they all dumped their files in the main folder.
 From researching, it seems my options are to either:
  
Ignore it and let everything be in the same folder
 
Mount the share on the OS level and use bind mounts
 
Use a separate NFS share and volume for each container
 
 #1 seems messy and definitely is not a good solution. I have seen #2 have race conditions where sometimes Docker is started before the share is mounted, causing all the containers to crash and need a reboot. #3 is a pain, I would need to log into OMV, create a shared folder, share it with NFS, then log into Portainer, create the volume, then use the app template to create the container, give the container the volume to use. This would have to be done for every container I create and would create a lot of unnecessary shares.
 Is there any better way to do this?

 Currently authenitcated API calls happen by using the user's personal API token.
 I want it to be simpler (less steps) aka use OAuth SSO for read permissions to confluence.BUT there's a problem, dev confluence required a static url to forward the user to after authentication is complete, but because my app is self-hosted this by design changes every time.
 Is there any workaround here?I have a few solutions I thought about (i.e configure DNS), but I'm looking for something well-known here.
 I expect my self-hosted app to not be available at localhost :(

 I was hoping it could act like a router, where I can give certain machines it's IP as their gateway, and all of their traffic will then be routed to PIA over the VPN. Would also be nice if it had a proxy for certain apps. If the VPN goes down, I want ALL traffic to halt.
 Is docker the best way to accomplish this? If so, which container would be best?
 Edit: I found a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBCrWs5bFsA) that shows me how to create a proxmox container that does exactly what I want. I was also able to create this in a proxmox VM. But I'm wondering if there is a way to accomplish this with a docker container?

 started filling them with jdownloader until the 3rd one begins to lag terribly. asked here what the problem was, "smr, working as intended"
 once downloads completed I figured I'd give chkdsk another pass just to be sure. 10 bad clusters found this time.
 I'm dumbfounded and angry at myself because I may not be able to return it despite the warranty (3rd world problems). I know I shouldn't trust it with important data, but considering I'm stuck with it, is there anything I can do? maybe zero fill?

 The Seagate is slower but and a rated TBW of 1800TB. The WD is faster and has a rated TBW of 600TB.
 Which one would you pick?
 The Seagate has the Phison E16 controller, which has been fault prone I think. The latest Firecuda 520 revision also has a TBW of 600. Unsure if they've made any hardware changes, or if they've adjusted it strictly because it couldn't reach its rated number.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have recently discovered https://noted.lol a website about self hosting and I really think it is great. I am in no way related to them, just sharing for those interested but I highly recommend it.
 https://preview.redd.it/6p3daekcwfba1.png?width=1704&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfa79d9aa7fc9241e0d113c4e096cef503bea706
 I am always looking for ideas of software I can host in my homelab and this website written as a blog, presents plenty of them. It does also have pretty cool tutorials.
 Finally they also support FOSS (free and open source) .
 Here is quick description from their website:
 Noted is an independent publication launched in April 2022 by Jeremy Irwin. The primary topics here are Home Lab, Self Hosting, Security and Open Source or free software (also known as FOSS) related content. Notes from an aspiring homelab and self hosting autodidact.
 You can learn more at https://noted.lol/about/
 In addition they also have a forum https://hosted.lol about Self Hosting and Homelab. I haven't too much used it yet, but it seems pretty interesting.
 ​

 Kudos and thank you to Jeremy the creator of this amazing website and for sharing it with us!
 There is also a discord (Thanks you u/MediaCowboy for the link): https://discord.gg/bN6wa3xPyd

Not sure I'd call myself a data hoarder but I do need to start thinking about reliable backup solutions for about a decade's worth of accumulated casual home data. Unorganized old pictures, music, movie downloads, software backups, etc. I have about a dozen mixed hard drives in capacities from 250GB to 1TB. I think total there's <10TB of data to be preserved but I'd like to be at least a little future-proofed.
 My current "gaming" desktop is a Core i7-3770 from 2014, 32GB ram, RTX 2060, running Linux Mint. I like this OS and I'm not exactly a newb when it comes to computers in general. I've considered building a NAS (I have enough spare parts to build maybe 2 other systems roughly on par with a 2014 "office" PC) but I'm wondering if it might be better to just install a software …]]></summary>

 can anyone recommend software I can use to test throughput ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I am building myself a NAS to digitize my parents' DVD collection, as well as store all my general data. I was tasked with removing HDDs from old PCs at work, and was able to snag a Dell X9M3X Motherboard (LGA 1155, DDR3), an intel i3-3220, 4 x 4Gb DDR3 DIMMs, a bunch of SATA Data cables, and a stock CPU Cooler, which I assume will be sufficient for a NAS. I also have a spare 550W PSU. Otherwise, I will need a case, boot drive, and storage drives
 I'm planning on getting a cheap 250 gb SSD as boot drive and 2 WD Red 4Tb HDDs in Raid1 as storage. My main concern is with my motherboard and case compatibility. It is an old Dell Mobo, and I'm worried about the front panel connectors being compatible. Can anyone shed some light on what sort of case I should be looking for? I could still take the original case from work, but that will only hold 1 3.5" HDD, and I would hope for some more HDD Bays for future expansion.
 I am at work right now and working on figuring out creating boot media for TrueNAS/FreeNAS, which doesn't seem to be too difficult, but I wanna make sure I haven't overlooked anything, so if you see any mistakes here, or can think of any common ones a beginner might make, let me know! Thanks!

 As an example, here is what I’ve tried so far:
 youtube-dl https://web.archive.org/web/20150109044401/http://vimeo.com/user10047112 
 But this returns an Unsupported URL error.
 Importantly, I’m NOT adding /videos after the username (i.e. user10047112/videos) and would just like to reference the Vimeo username itself when downloading all the videos.
 Any way to do this?

 I love reading and recently started hoarding books but finding legitimate non-DRM books seems impossible. Yes most DRM books can be made DRM free with De-DRM but I am kind of on the fence about giving money to DRM supported companies and potentially breaking the law by removing the DRM. I would much prefer just buying a DRM free edition even if it’s more expensive. 
 Thanks!

 The downside is that my work blocks all sites that use DuckDNS, and this blocking occurs on my work laptop whether I'm on my work network or not. 
 Is there a dynamic DNS service out there that is less likely to be blocked? Or is there a way to keep the IP address of a domain from, say, Google Domains up to date?

 Recently, I have been participating in the development of a data exploration and visualization app which can be used as a different type of open-source alternative to Tableau. It is extremely easy to embed in your apps just as a react component.
 The original purpose is to develop a lite plugin that can be easily embedded in most cases, it doesn't have to be a large heavy BI system, but a lite graphic plugin.

 The main features implemented:
  
A user-friendly drag-and-drop-based interaction for exploratory data analysis with visualizations.
 A grammar of graphics-based visual analytic user interface where users can build visualization from low-level visual channel encodings.
 A Data Explainer explains why some patterns occur / what may cause them.
 Using web workers to handle computation tasks which allows you to use it as a pure front-end app.
  
And you can use it in your app as a react component!
 import { GraphicWalker } from '@kanaries/graphic-walker';
 const YourEmbeddingTableauStyleApp: React.FC = props => { const { dataSource, fields } = props; return <GraphicWalker dataSource={dataSource} rawFields={fields} spec={graphicWalkerSpec} i18nLang={langStore.lang} /> } export default YourEmbeddingTableauStyleApp; 
 What features do you think are important to add? Feedbacks and advice are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you made the switch, was it all it was cracked up to be, was it just exciting as doing it in your own home, more exciting, less exciting? And why? 
 Since the start of Covid I picked up homelabbing as a hobby. I created a few servers, replaced my ISP router with a open source solution, learned programming, virtualisation with various Linux Distro’s, Docker and am now starting to learn Kubernetes. I love learning about this stuff, spending hours lurking on this subreddit and tinkering around with these technologie. It never gets boring! 
 My background is not in IT and even though I’m currently working as an IT Consultant, it’s mainly on the business side and not very technical. I’m wondering more and more if I should make a switch to a more technical role, applying what I learned from the Homelab. One thing I’m scared of is losing the passion I have for it now, once I have to do this for a living. Is this something anyone has experienced? 
 And while we’re at it, what are some roles to look into? I’ve seen some DevOps Engineering roles with a focus on Infrastructure, which seem to use a lot of the technologies I use at home. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On its way to v1.0 which I plan to release in a few months, v0.4.0 is available now. Contributions and feedback are very welcome!
 New checks:
  
Temperature which checks temperature values provided by lm_sensors (optional dependency).
 SystemdUnitStatus checks whether a systemd unit is active or not.
  
New placeholders:
  
system_uptime_iso and minmon_uptime_iso: ISO8601 Duration formatted uptime values.
  
Other new features:
  
Docker ARMv7 and ARM64/ARMv8 images now available.
 Checks now implement a configurable timeout (similar to actions) that defaults to 5 seconds.
  
Notes
  
Docker base image switched from alpine to debian-slim because of the missing ARMv7 support on the rust:alpine image.

 My problem is, with my DL180 G6 8-3.5 bay model I got a H310 flashed in IT mode but I don't see the lights, like activity lights, blinking on the backplane. I see them they actually work in POST when the server boots up but after that they never turn on again. Is this normal with the H310?
 If they are supposed to work, how I do that? I've tried "ledmon", specifically the same command as the post I've linked before " ledctl locate=/dev/sda " but it does not blink any light.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are few guides around on using the 5070 as a router and it seems very doable. However the few things I've found either focus on the extended version which is a bit beefier as far as expand-ability..... OR they ONLY focus on a router/firewall with nothing else on the machine. With 8 or 16 gigs and enough storage how would the small thin client do if I threw docker on it and had it also run a few other things like pihole, my unifi controller, smokeping, homarr.....? Nothing super heavy load but I'm curious if anyone has done this specifically? I'd love to move a few services off other bigger systems I have in the house and consolidate them onto this one system.... things that are related more to our network itself rather than any of my "lab" tinker systems.

 I have been looking for a very specific solution but couldn’t find it yet. Need some input!
 My company has a task queue that creates tasks from emails (unfortunately that’s the only inbound channel). I’m looking for some tool that would fulfill these requirements:
  
AD SSO or equivalent enterprise security
 Admin sets it up (SMTP, Auth, Roles)
 Users create and schedule their own emails, like Mon-Fri at 9AM, 1PM and 4PM
  
I’m open to out out of the box suggestions, too. Unfortunately I couldn’t find anything that checked those 3 boxes yet. Paid solutions and services are acceptable, although this would be the wrong audience, but I hope it doesn’t disqualify the request, as the main component would ideally be selfhosted.
 Thank you!! Helvio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow hoarders,
 This might be slightly off-topic, but this is the only part of Reddit that I trust would answer this from my perspective, in contrast to r/Productivity or other project manager-heavy forums.
 I hoard around 40TB of Data. My day trade is Audio Director in gaming, and I freelance writing orchestral scores.
 The sheer amount of software tools and technical solutions to get my profession and my hobby running has become far to excessive to keep in my head. I find myself googling the same things over and over as I use Linux, Windows and macOS in parallell, constantly forgetting what I learned the other day. Sometimes I know I’ve read something somewhere but I can’t find it again. Or the link is dead.
 I need a personal Wiki to which I can download-save an entire webpage (with images, etc) preferably with one click and then set up a register with various technical documents.
 Problem is that most are too complex to deal with in everyday work. I don’t have time fiddling with layout, and it needs to be a smooth UI, otherwise I’ll just stop using it in practice.
 I’ve tried Notion.so, but it’s too slow working with, and doesn’t feel intuitive. We use Confluence at work, but that requires too much time to work ”on-the-fly” when other things than documenting is the current priority.
 Any suggestions of how all of you save and keep track of your technical documentation?

 these containers are accessed from the outside world via cloudflare tunnels, e.g.
 container1.mydomain.com
 container2.mydomain.com
 ..and so on
 Because I'm a cretin it never occured to me to set up a firewall on the pi, but now I'm doing this new set up I wanted to be clear on what's essential and what isn't.
 Do I need to activate / set up firewall rules in ubuntu for any incoming traffic from my domains above? There are no open ports on my router and everything's been accessible and fine so far.
 If ruled are required, any guidance on how they should be epxressed in GUFW would be extra-appreciated

 ​
 Conscious that partpicker's estimated Wattage (396W) by a 0.8 factor comes up to 500W which seems to be cutting it pretty close.
 850VA/480W is the largest Eaton 5E UPS available here though which is still fanless and given this particular server is sitting in a living area I'd like to avoid fan noise if possible

 I am looking for media management tool that will automatically remove media that has been watched and a set amount time has passed. Not sure if there is an existing tool that can do this while checking jellyfin/plex to see if a specific media was watched. I am not sure if anything like this exists, so I wanted to ask all the experts here if they know of something like this. 
 Use Case:
 My spouse downloads a movie and we all watch it. I would want to it delete it from my library 30 days after it was watched. We are unlikely to watch it again and do not want to manage it.

 Thank you in advance!

I'm looking for a simple and easy to deploy authentication proxy that supports something like JWT to put in front of NGINX. I want to separate the auth from NGINX. 
 Currently, I was thinking of just rolling a small Go-based forward proxy that validates the JWT from an auth header, but open to utilities that are nice and lightweight.
 ​
 As an aside, how is Keycloak? It seems beefier and probably more than I would need, but just curious on what people are doing. My plan is to just have a central auth container that proxies into my private subnet. I'll hook up fail2ban on it, etc.

 Con:what do you think humbub is missing for private social group? not federated ?honestly, I don't think how federated solution work, and don't know how federate social forum can help in this use case? like users can join other public federated network using the the private hosted account? let the user decide ?
 Q1. Mostly wonder what are some features that you wish humhub already had.
 Q2. Can the users of a private federated social network opt in to join other public federated social network? (I know sound contradiction, ( hometown is fork of Mastodon, which has post visible to local instance only, seem perfect fix for this scenario?)Q3, what are the alternatives to humhub to check out nodebb?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I did some research into hosting my own email servers recently and I quickly realized why it’s generally not a good idea.
 I keep most of my commonly used email accounts on Google Workspace as it’s a good work horse for daily email. But I have dozens of domains I self host on my home severs, and several of them have emails I’d like to keep up but don’t really want to pay for my old host’s email servers. 
 Essentially I still pay my old host’s prices per mailbox just because of convenience and the fact that they offer a catch-all mailbox that I can automatically scoop email from any messages sent to any email address pointed at their host. The catch all doesn’t have sending of course, but it’s super handy to be able to use emails on the fly on domains I own and not have to set anything up. 
 All that background to say: do you guys have any cheap but solid email services you prefer to use? Preferably with a catch all for any domains I point at it.
 Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice!

 It costs me around 13 cents in electricity just to back up my SSD RAID internally. It'll cost me around 25 cents to spin up my other T620 and copy the backup over to that. All in all, I'll spend 38 cents today just to backup my data.
 Can anyone else quantify their mundane homelab operations in terms of dollars?

 As I'm trying to build a small home server, but waiting for my Raspberry Pi to arrive, I wanted to install Raspberry Pi OS on a Virtual Machine so that I can practice with the possibilities during the waiting. Especially to play around with all the cool selfhosted-packages that are available.
 I'm using the tutorial from The Robotics Back-End, which seems pretty straightforward. But in step Install GRUB boot loader I get the following error:
 Executing 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed 
 For the Virtual Machine I'm using VirtualBox on a Macbook Pro 2016 with Monterey. The settings are like they use in the tutorial: Debian (64-bit), 4GB Memory, 10GB Virtual Harddisk, 2 cores. I'm using the ISO downloaded from the Raspberry Pi-website. Because there it says it's a 32-bit-version, I've also tried the whole process with a Debian (32-bit) on VirtualBox, but it gives the same error.
 ​
 The error in question
 I am a real beginner at this all, please keep that in mind :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I am beginning to reach the point where i am losing track of photos / forgetting where they are stored (probably safe somewhere... just a question of where), before going out and spending loads on DAS/NAS storage i was looking at getting additional hard drives for my computer which i could use something like freefilesync to essentially have raid1 redundancy across the two drives. 
 Can anyone with better knowledge advice differently? only issue i can see with this solution is longevity in the sense of adding additional drives as the total storage would be limited by the size of the drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I am looking at getting some NAS drives for a 2 bay synology nas, for PC/iPad/Phone backup. I have settled on at least 8tb of storage, as I am unlikely to store dvd/BR rips (unless a very small number of cherished films - but i doubt it).
 I can get new 8tb drives for about £180 each new from an authorised retailer, or I can buy 12tb sea gate ironwolf pro and 16tb exos drives for about £140-150 on ebay (clearly these are grey market drives).
 Obviously the cost saving is huge for grey market (without warranty) Does anyone have experience of using/buying grey market drives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a way to browse the web while effortlessly and transparently building a data-hoard.
 There are particular data sets that I can easily see in visual form around the web that I would much rather have locally. Most of these take the form of JSON server responses with database keys in the request URL.
 Instead of laboring to set up per-site scrapers (and risking whatever anti-scraping security guards they have in place), I would much rather have my web browser fetch them exactly how the site intends... but save them in a place that I can operate on them later.
 Perhaps this takes the form of configurable regular expressions to identify which requests to save?
 Does anybody know if such a thing exists? A browser extension, some debug mode, a special browser built for that purpose?

 Anyone can suggest a system for this? Preference for AMD EPYC, but as long as it can sustain 100Gbps it's fine. Small servers the preference, outside the NIC and the NVMe adapters, I don't need anything else in there. And frankly, unless the machines are dirt cheap, I will likely put them up for sale in 6months once the tests are done. So looking for the most economical way to set this up.
 Thanks for the suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crossposted from /r/minecraft
 I used to run a Minecraft Bedrock server for my son up until a year or so ago (he had moved on to other things, but he and his friends are back into Minecraft again). I updated the server and brought it back online but it is no longer reachable from the WAN, only LAN.
 I did an entire day's worth of troubleshooting, here's where I'm at:
  
Setup 1: Synology NAS, Docker, marctv & itzg minecraft-bedrock-server images
 Setup 2: Mac Mini, Docker, itzg-minecraft-bedrock-server image
  
Though I have a few setups I actually only run one server– the multiple images & systems were set up strictly for troubleshooting. Regardless of image, setup, or system, I have the exact same issues.
 When I run Bedrock Server versions below a certain release number, my server is reachable on LAN and WAN but players are warned that it's out of date. When I run images above a certain release number, players can not connect from the WAN– only LAN. Here are those details:
  
v1.19.22.01 ≤ "Could not connect: Outdated server!"
 v1.19.31.01 ≥ "Unable to connect to world."
  
I use the standard UDP port, 19132. My router's port forwarding setup has not been changed since our previous setup, and I can confirm that the UDP port is reachable from the WAN:
 Netcat command ran from an external sever (personal info redacted):
 % nc -zvu *********.***********.com 19132*********.***********.com [**.***.**.***] 19132 (?) open
 BedrockInfo.com can happily probe my server and display detailed information– even showing the number of LAN players: https://i.imgur.com/fuDQGgo.png
 What gives?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I currently use a Unifi AP. I just recently started having random drops and when nothing wired was dropping odd, I decided it might be a good time to replace. 
 A little background: I use OPNSense for my firewall and I have POE on my network switch. I currently have 4 SSIDs and I have them set up with 3 different VLANs for segregation (Normal, guest, IOT). So, that's all it really needs to support. I have no problem buying another UAP. But, I recently saw another that people were suggesting (TP-Link?). I didn't save it because I thought that I didn't need one. 
 I just want to know my options before I pull the trigger.

 The thing is that I do need good uptime so I don’t just want to relay on one unraid server. 
 I happen to have one Unraid served in Europe and one in California. I was planning to use cloud flare tunnels to get my domain “forwarded” to my docker container. 
 Is there any way to use cloud flare tunnels or cloud flare in general to point to both of my servers at the same time and let the system decide which one has the quicker response? I’d hope that if someone from Europe wants to access my site they’ll get forwarded to the EU server and someone from the US to my CA server. 
 Is this doable at all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, r/selfhosted, been a long-time lurker, but first time poster. I've currently got a server hosted at home, connected to a VPS (oracle cloud, if that matters) via tailscale. I'm currently accessing all of my webservers hosted through my main server via rinetd, but I've been having a lot of issues with it working with gameservers, minecraft in particular. I know this tool has been around for a long time, but I wasn't able to find much documentation on how to troubleshoot connections breaking off and not working with rinetd. My config file looks something like this: 
  
 10.0.0.22 25565/tcp unraid 25565/tcp 
  
 Now, I have a similar setup for forwarding the web traffic, using 443 on the host, 44301 on the client (same devices, client and server, as with the minecraft one). Whenever I try to connect to the service through port 25565, it opens the connection then immediately closes it saying: "done-local-closed" without the service on the backend even receiving anything. I've seen that people have used rinetd for minecraft in the past, seeing as it can proxy tcp connections, but what on earth am I doing wrong? Also, I've been able to successfully forward traffic to an sftp server on the same client, using said tcp forwarding. What am I doing wrong here? The setup for the sftp forwarding is almost exactly the same as for the minecraft one, except using a different port instead.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks

 Alex here from Immich. The team and I just pushed out a new release last night. It included the new Public Sharing feature, one of the coolest features we have recently added. Since this is the public-facing mechanism, can you guys help us test it and give any feedback/improvement thoughts you might have?
 You can read the release note here https://github.com/immich-app/immich/releases/tag/v1.41.0_64-dev
 Here are a few snippets of information from the release note
 ​
 Create shared link
 Each album can have multiple links; each link can be individually configured based on the permission to upload or the expiration time. You can manage all the links in the shared link page, not just the shared link for the group of assets. 
 ​
 Shared links management
 As a public user, he/she can
  
View individual assets.
 Download a group of assets.
 Download the whole shared album.
 Upload asset (if allowed) - the asset will belong to the user that shares the link.
  
​
 Public user view
 We plan to add the functionality to share individual or group assets in the next release. 
 Thank you 🫡 
 Alex

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All - Like many of you, I have a bunch of containerized web applications running on a Linux PC in my basement all listening on different ports. I thought it might be nice to set up a reverse proxy so 1) I don't have to remember so many port numbers and 2) so I could access more than one of them when I'm away from home.
 I'm following this tutorial pretty much
 https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/Docker-Nginx-reverse-proxy-setup-example
 though I'm doing it remotely. The NGINX container is listening on port 80.
 To start out, I'm trying to define a location for the Pi-Hole web UI. I defined it in the default.conf file like so:
 location /pihole { proxy_pass http://192.168.1.75:8080/; } 
 After copy this conf file back to the container and reload it, when I go to http://192.168.1.75/pihole, I get the "Did you mean to go to the admin panel?" link but the pihole logo doesn't load, and clicking the link results in a 404 error. Going to http://192.168.1.75:8080 directly works fine.
 Any suggestions for what I should be doing differently?

 I have been wanting to host my own mailserver at home, but since I have a dynamic IP and yadda yadda, I can't do it from home. You know the drill.
 I'm currently hosting mailcow-dockerized on a rented server, but I don't want my data out there. I also don't want to use their CPU and Memory for $ reasons.
 So what I want to do is:
 Spin up mailcow in a docker in it's own VM. Do everything mail related in that VM, except for networking, which I wanted to use a VPS's instead. So all the traffic into the VPS is routed into the VM, and SOME traffic in the VM (port 25, 465, 587... others?) is proxied by the VPS.
 Any ideas/recipes on how to do that? Anyone ever had the same project?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I haven't decided if this is a fun thought experiment or if I may be crazy (dumb?) enough to try it. But I was thinking of this idea for a "Poor man's RAID"...of sorts.
 Let's say I have 2 or more drives (though 2 is a trivial case). Let's also assume that no one drive is larger than the sum of the others. For example, 8,8,18 won't work but 8,10,18 is fine.
 On each drive, partition (either bona-fide partition or just earmark the storage) into two: data and backups. 
 The main workspace is a union (rclone union, mergerfs, unionfs, etc) of all of the data partitions. I backup each individual data partition to a union of all of the others' backup partitions.
 A 3-drive example demonstrates this well:
 ├── A │ ├── backup │ │ ├── B │ │ └── C │ └── data ├── B │ ├── backup │ │ ├── A │ │ └── C │ └── data └── C ├── backup │ ├── A │ └── B └── data 
 My workspace is A + B + C in a union-type drive.
 Then I have three sync/backup scripts that use something like rclone union:
 A/data --> B/backup/A + C/backup/A B/data --> A/backup/B + C/backup/B C/data --> A/backup/C + B/backup/C 
 If the sync is just a sync, then this is like a poor-man's non-instant RAID (and you partition 50%). If it includes versioning backups (e.g. Kopia or Restic to an rclone union), then is also a backup (and you'd want to partition more space).
 The union rules would be random to help spread it out. I could rebalance manually as needed. If/when I add a drive, I could rebalance it then too.
 I am aware if SnapRAID and some similar tools but I like the file-based nature of this approach. I am not saying it is less complex; just different. And I like that it is easy to incorporate backups, I don't need advanced filesystems (I am mostly macOS), I can add drives of just about any size (with some rebalancing), recovery takes no real special tools, etc.
 Thoughts?

 I recently received a Buffalo Linkstation LS210D. I learned that I can access my files through web and locally on my computer.
 My thought process is to create client folders so they can upload files and I'll have access to them wherever (like dropbox, but without the monthly fee).
 So I created web access folders & users who have their own specific folders no one else can access, but after doing that when I try and access the local network folders on my computer, it says I need to log in first. I tried all the usernames and passwords, but get hit with not having permission and I need to log out (attached picture).
 I'm just so confused about what I need to do in order to have private folders and still have access to them locally as well. Any help is very much appreciated.

 Hi,
 Since I have cancelled my cloud account for work-based backups, I am doing manual backups to an external HDD usually once per month.
 I am wondering is there a reliable backup software that would enable me to scan the desired folders and only copy the new files which don’t exist in current backup. It’s very painful to copy and rewrite 300+ GB, and thousands and thousands of files each and every time.
 Cheers, thank you.

 Example: looking at http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ and trying to find specific people's journal pages, but only a few come up when searching for "/journal". I know it's leaving out results as one would expect http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~sect12nj/journal.html to show up under the results for that search and it doesn’t. What can I do to get all of the results for the different /journal pages?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow selfhosters,
 I need some advice for working around my ISPs CGNAT (Carrier Grade NAT). Since I do not have a public IPv4 address, I cannot simply forward the ports on my router and point my domain at my IP address.
 My setup:
  
router with no public IPv4 (CGNAT)
 Ubuntu 22.04 server that hosts apps in docker
 container hosted apps accessible internally via server_ip:port
 internal clients (desktop pc)
 external clients (phone on LTE, work laptop)
  
What I'm trying to achieve:
  
applications (i.e. nextcloud) accessible internally and externally via sub domain (i.e. nextcloud.domain.net)
 SSL encryption both internally and externally
  
I found the github project selfhosted-gateway which at first seemed promising. It basically connects a reverse proxy on a VPS via wireguard tunnel directly to your application container on your server. However, due to how the VPN tunnels are set up, it makes the application inaccessible from the internal network. This means, when I connect to the apps from my desktop, it would route me through the VPS back into the server, introducing a lot of latency and bandwidth reduction.
 What I want is for internal clients (desktop or phone on wifi) to directly connect to my server and only external clients (phone on LTE) through the VPS.
 I have looked at other RPoVPN (Reverse Proxy over VPN) setups but I have a hard time wrapping my head around everything.
 Has anyone worked around similar issues and can give me some guidance? 
 PS: No, I cannot switch to another ISP. My current ISP offers (non-static) public IPv4 for 5€ a month but I would prefer not to support such greed.

 The thing that surprised me was how many I have - ~450. Feels like a lot and my gut says it's higher than a normie but probably about right for a self hoster. How many passwords do you have?
 My post isn't meant to turn into a measuring contest. Just curious on what's the norm here. I suspect my issue is that I have never done any password clean-up because that takes time and storage is cheap...
 Tldr: God I hate changing passwords. How big is your vault?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I have a bit of a bad habit of redoing my home lab every year in January and February, and I'm finding myself in the same predicament again. I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to redo my current setup in order to reduce power usage and make it more efficient.
 Here's a rundown of my current setup:
  
PFSense: 50Watts, running on a G4560 @ 3.50GHz 2C & 2T, 8GB DDR4 RAM, 4 Port 1 GBPS NIC, and a 120GB SATA SSD (QLC NAND Flash)
 Proxmox: 50W - 70W, running on an i5-9400F CPU 2.90GHz 6C & 6T, 4 x 16GB DDR4, 120GB NVME, 3 x 240GB SATA SSD (QLC NAND Flash), 1TB HDD, and a 120GB SATA SSD (QLC NAND Flash)
 Network Setup: 1 x 48 Port Unifi Switch (15 watts), 1 x 24 Port POE Switch (34 watts), 1 x Raspberry Pie 4 4GB (3 watts) as a primary DNS (PIHOLE), 1 x Unifi Cloudkey Gen 2+ (6 watts)
  
The main devices mentioned above run 24/7 and consume around 4272 watts, which is quite high. So I decided to reduce Router (PFSense) usage, which is 1200Watts per 24 by purchasing a low powered Mini PC.
 I purchased Lenovo ThinkCentre M93P Desktop edition with Core i3 4130T 2.9GHz and I was able to get it down to 30W in Windows 10 by fiddling with it. I then tried installing Proxmox and it used around 25-27W max. I also tried using SSD and it now uses 17W max. But i wasn't able to find any option to underclock the CPU in the bios.
 Suddenly I got an idea, what if I combine all 3 of the below to reduce power usage?
  
Install Proxmox and install the following as VM / CT: 
 PFSense with 4 Port NIC Passed (VM)
 PiHole (CT)
 Unifi Controller (CT)
 TP-Link Controller (CT) -- i am soon going to get few TPLink Cameras
 
  
Based on my calculations, my daily power usage would be around 3456 watts, and I think that the new Proxmox setup would use around 25W.
 I would really appreciate some feedback and ideas on this, please share your thoughts on my current setup and any suggestions you might have on how to make it more efficient.

 I'm running into a weird issue. I've recently added a 10 Gbps Mellanox Connectx-3 card into my HP Microserver Gen 10+. I have an Aruba Instant On 1930 24G 4SFP+ switch, and a U6 Pro, a U6 Lite and an AC LR.
 I use RHEL 8.7, with latest drivers for the Mellanox card directly from NVIDIA. Drivers were installed successfully without any errors and the driver even updated the firmware of the NIC.
 The SFP+ transceivers are from fs.com and are coded for the Aruba switch and Mellanox, respectively. There should be no issue with compatibility.
 I ran multiple instances of iperf on the server.
 This is the output of running the ethtool command on the server.

 Hello!
 Looking for a little guidance in here, I recently bought a DELL R300 Server and installed PROXMOX 7.3-3 on a 320GB HDD for local VMs and a 500 HDD single disk RAID for anything else needed (looking for to add another drive on the CD/DVD section to create a 2 disk RAID array for redundancy)
 I am quite new on the homelab world I must say
 A little after I bought a NetApp DS2246 NAJ-1001 Disk Array 2x Controllers X3245A-R6 + 2 x X1150A-R6 8GBps with 18 - 600GB HDD SAS disks, then bought a PCIe LSI HBA SAS controller to install on the server and also a QSFP to MiniSAS cable for the connection.
 So far so good, PROXMOX running fine and both internal HDDs are available on the server, connected the LSI HBA controller and through the initial boot I can see the controller and all the disks through Avago setup as an enclousure, but I am not able to passthroug the PCIe card to install a VM with FreeNAS (so I can manage all the array through there). Not only that, but I cannot see the disks on the proxmox side (neither locally on the server (lsblk command) with a keyboard or mouse nor in the PROXMOX GUI)
 As far as I understand under proxmox I must have enabled IOMMU which I have done following the documentation, but at the moment I have the VM and try to passthrough the PCIe controller, it says IOMMU is not enabled but I can see the LSI card (Images attached)
 Also I have not been able to activate the NIC for IPMI support, I have tried it through NIC 1 and 2 without success, tried it with a DHCP adress and a static IP Adress, on the DELL R300 page it says IPMI 2.0 is supported and has a BMC.
 If I am missing any info please let me know
 Anyone that may know about this here that can help me please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an LSI 9201-16i that I would like to use for DAS. It's a full size PCI card and as such will not fit into my Thinkcentre M920s, which only supports low profile cards:
  
One PCIe 3.0 x1, low-profile (length < 150mm, height < 68mm)
 One PCIe 3.0 x16 (x4 signal), low-profile (length < 150mm, height < 68mm)
 One PCIe 3.0 x16, low-profile (length < 150mm, height < 68mm)
 One dummy slot, only bracket for optional port
  
The case also has the following bays:
  
1x 2.5" disk bay (optional, or bay comes with disk)
 1x 3.5" disk bay
 1x slim ODD bay
  
I'm not currently making use of any of the expansion slots, the 2.5" bay, or the ODD bay. I could also free up the 3.5" bay if needed.
 Is there a way that I can mount this card in one of the bays so that the ports are accessible from outside of the machine? I assume I'd need some sort of PCIe extension cable (is this the same thing as a riser?) and a bracket made to fit in one of the bays, but I'm coming up short on my search.
 Also open to other suggestions/ideas as long as they don't involve buying a new machine - my goal here is to attach a bunch of disks and pass them to a TrueNAS VM.

Based on the usual $15/tb I see people talking about when they're looking to upgrade, I figured I could go as high as $90 for my 6tb drives, or $60 if I wanted to be generous. But I went and checked eBay and found that a lot of comparable capacity drives being listed for around $40. Then on the other end of the spectrum there were also some people listing drives for closer to $100.
 So what I'm asking is, what price would you consider fair for used 6tb drives that were functioning perfectly fine last time I checked and were only replaced due to a need for more space?

 I wanted to take over routing functions and set up VLANs on my network to segregate IoT, guest wifi, and a few other services I run. I have a couple of wifi routers that could be used as APs. I currently have Netgear Orbi Pro SRK60 as a router.
 Since I have quite a bit of leftover resources on my r710, I was considering virtualizing a router using a Red Hat guest on with QEMU/KVM. 
 Do I need to be talked off the ledge, or does anyone make this work? I'd really like to maintain my speeds and reliability if possible. What I'm afraid of is a failure on my r710 or my switch that's time consuming to restore internet to the household. 
 Can anyone offer some experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone experienced poor throughput between VMs using ESXi? I've been doing some iperf3 tests and can only really get about 6 gigabits a second.
 My testing is between two Linux VMs (Fedora Live CD) on the same port group and vSwitch.
 I thought it would be helpful to make sure my server was up to date so i upgraded to ESXi 8 and vCenter 8 but that didn't make any real difference. Running iperf3 with parallel connections still tops out at the same speeds. Sitting here scratching my head...
 I was under the impression between two VMs on the same vSwitch i should be able to easily surpass 10 gigabit. I am open to any ideas at this point.

I would prefer something like those for the cost and low wattage but concerned if they are sufficient (buffer size etc)for running iscsi for some esxi servers or if I am going to be running into problems. Alternatively I could try to find a cheap used n4032f but the rack sits fairly close to me in my home office so trying to avoid high wattage/heat/noise if I can get away with it. Looking to get 12-16 sfp+ ports. Open to other options so feel free to share any input.

It seems like it should be relatively trivial to set up with today's tech, but the market forces that be are so focused on locking people in to their own branded service that customizability just isn't a thing. 
 Is there some combination of home automation and voice recognition services I could run on a home server to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did anybody archive these? Since Gateway's old support/downloads site went away years ago, I can't find much of anything for their older systems.
 Working with an MFATXPNT ES2 500S P04. Looks similar to the (emachines??) E4xxx series, but apparently different enough that those drivers don't work. I've tried a few sketchy .zip files, all of which seemed to contain valid drivers but not applicable to my system. Fresh install of XP SP3 BSODs on first boot after installing them.
 Archive.org has some of the old restore discs, but none for my system as far as I can tell.
 This is probably complicated by the fact that I don't know what Gateway's lineup looked like in 2001, so I'm not sure what might be compatible unless it's specifically labeled as being for my system.
 If anyone has one of those old burgundy restore discs or an iso for this thing, it would be much appreciated. Or if there is a public archive of Gateway drivers+software from back in the day, I'd love a pointer to it. Going on 2 weeks now with no luck.
 (I also have a GP7-450 Piii box I will probably need drivers for eventually, but I decided to start with the Pentium 4 XP box since I figured that would be the easier one to set up.)

I've been an avid user of blending MakeMKV and Handbrake to rip my media into a more usable format. I found that Handbrake has a great image for automating this, but today I learned MakeMKV also has a similar container with auto-rip functionaloty... I can just grab a couple shelves and port my external DVD/Bluray over to my rack. But I would prefer a cleaner/sturdy approach. I can't seem to find any examples of one but has anyone come across a rack that either includes DVDs / bluerays or maybe some brackets that I could mount my existing drives onto cleanly?

 What’s the best way to start trying to recover data - a couple of the companies I called say that making an attempt on my own could make recoverable data unrecoverable for the company. 
 1) how true is that statement? 2) what’s a reasonable rate to pay someone to attempt to recover the data?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title. This drive is about 5 years old and is used pretty much daily for documents, games and things like that. From what I know, pending sectors aren't necessarily critical, so for now I'm not that worried about it, but I also don't want it to randomly die while doing something important. The first sector appeared about 2 weeks ago (possibly because the power cut out a bit that day), the second appeared this Saturday. I also notice the raw read error rate getting gradually worse after the first sector appeared. Didn't do any tests but the drive also maybe feels just a little bit slower lately too. Other than that it seems to be working fine for now. So for now I decided to ask here, as people on this sub obviously have more knowledge about this than me. Thoughts?

 From all of the places I've seen R720s for sale they're ranging from around $700-1k (CAD) (For the specs posted above, this is around $1k). Does anyone have any input on what would be considered a decent price for an R720?
 ​
 Thanks, in advanced!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently use Amazon S3 to host about 50GB of digital products. Download links to the individual products are sent to customers after purchase through our website. This results in about 1-4TB of downloads per month. Amazon S3 charges $.09/GB for egress. I am looking for any good alternatives that would suit our use case here that might be less expensive. Or if anyone has any other ideas for accomplishing this set up, that would be great as well. I already talked to Wasabi who told me that with their service, downloads can never exceed storage capacity, so this would not work with them. 
 Anybody have experience doing something similar with Dropbox, Backblaze, Google Drive, other services? 
 I looked through different subs and r/DataHoarder seemed to be the most fitting for my question here, hope this is ok. 
 Thanks!

Working with all the biggest data centers now. I’m an engineer and have worked in the industry for a long time but never in a role like this.
 It’s pretty amazing how much money and infrastructure goes into storing our data. And it’s invisible to most of us.
 I wish I could write more but I can’t write anything too specific unfortunately.
 Like you guys I build servers and hoard data for fun. So to get a huge raise to do this for a living is pretty great. I wish I could take the spare drives home and send them out to people here, but alas I cannot.
 I actually got this job because of my experience in forums like these and other hobbies like chia mining, running raspberry pis, etc. that couple with my degree and prior experience gave me just enough of an edge to get a 60% raise doing this job during a recession.
 So if you’re doing this as a hobby just remember it can translate into valuable skills and job opportunities if you have the degree or certs or whatever.

 I've been gradually learning self-hosting with docker and have some light stuff running on a RPi4 2GB without any issue at all. Currently:
 Audiobookshelf
 Portainer
 Overseerr
 Heimdall
 Cloudflared
 ...and some other bits that come & go as I experiment. All this works perfectly without a hitch.
 I was thinking of moving all this over to one of the mini PCs since they out-spec the PI even if they're not amazing machines in their own right. I won't be running plex or any other video service.
 Is that a reasonable move? I don't want to do it all then find out it would have been better to keep using a Pi.

 I've read through previous posts and have noticed that people seem to think that TP-Link Jetstreams (with aftermarket fans) and Ciscos are both solid options. Would anyone be willing to try to talk me into one or the other, or tell me why one is objectively worse? I've found both a Jetsream and Cisco Small Business SG300 on FB Marketplace for about the same price ($150ish). There's also a Cisco SG350 for 50% more. Models listed below and thanks in advance!

 What I need is a way, devices, monitoring and docker containers can send me notifications. It does not must be a local mail server, it could be anything else. But as I have seen, almost everything is able to send an email, so this form is widely used and supported.
 I need someting very slim as one or more docker containers:
  
Local mail server (local only) accepting mail from SMTP
 IMAP to fetch the mails or a webmail
 I will read the notification mails local only
  
I do not need a full blown mail server with anti spam and anti virus and so on, only a slim mail server.
 Do you have an idea what to use?
 How do you manage notification from your devices in your homelab?

 I am a bit overwhelmed with ideas but have a mental roadmap of:
  
Kali VM, 4GB RAM, 80GB storage.
 splunk SIEM VM, 4GB RAM, 200GB storage.
 pfsense VM (is it worth going bare-metal with a switch?) 4GB RAM, 80GB storage.
 2-3 VMs for Windows AD group, 8GB each, 80GB storage each.
  
This leads me to ruminating over the following 3 choices in terms of hardware. I don't really want to exceed a budget of £800.
 1) Laptop

 My question is about Cache and clock speed. Both the 5700G and 5700X are within my price range, the X has a higher clock speed and higher amounts of cache in L2+3 but lower in L4.
 I'm just going to be running proxmox with windows and various Linux VMs. I'm more so curious how a cache affects server operations.

 Even if somehow I bought video files for the movie, I always hearing about the importance of backing it up. Which makes me thinking, even though I watch the movie from ripped Blu-ray Disc files, isn’t it much better to keep the disc for safety reason?
 Since 2023 started I can’t stop thinking about this, and I couldn’t find the answer I seeking, so I decided to question it directly. Please let me know your opinion, or general consensus on this topic. Hopefully it doesn’t buried because it’s a dumb question….

 I have been running this setup for the past 3 years now works great. Upgraded the PSU's in the shelf 
 ​
 R320
 E5-2450L 
 64 GB DDR3 ECC fully registered
 4 SSD and 2 600gb hdds for nzbget and as a dump for temp files etc
 Currently at 70W idle roughly
 ​
 NetApp DS4246
 Upgraded the power supply's to TDPS-580BB (more efficient)
 9x 4TB SAS in a Raid Z2 currently 
 Estimated 90W
 ​
 UPS LOSS around 10W ish...
 ​
 Currently runs TrueNAS Scale
 Apps
 sonarr radarr nzbget plex vpn home assistant os in a vm
 SMB all the basic rubbish to be honest I'm not exactly a power user
 ​
 Total draw is 170W I even moved the server to a outbuilding (not damp don't worry) but during winter its about 2-3C in there, I noticed during winter I can lower my consumption to 170w in summer its more 190w because the fans ramp. I wanted to ask if there's any further steps I can take to reduce power consumption as living in the UK at the moment its been my mission to reduce power as the cost is rising.
 what are you doing to reduce your power consumption?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have Promtail setup to ship my Traefik access logs to Loki. Promtail runs in Docker. Additionally on my host system i setup logrotate to rotate my log files every night at 3am.
 After rotating the logs, Promtail will stop shipping any new log lines. Most likely because it does not open the new access.log file that has been rotated.
 I tried sending USR1, USR2 and HUP signals to the Promtail container, but none of those trigger a reload of the truncated file.
 Does anyone have Promtail working with logrotation?

 i live in Central America, my life is out of a backpack. (I'm not complaining, I rather enjoy this life) however, I am mobile all the time. I backup my current lap top to 3 drives.(3-2-1 rule, I just don't follow the 1 part very well).
 I'm out grown my 4tb drive and looking at a external dual enclosure to replace my single 4tb. My plan would be keep the 4 and buy either a new 4tb or upgrade to a 8tb Samsung. 
 what do I use this drive for? I backup MY laptop, my wife's and 2tbs of movies, music and such. 
 problem: my movie collection is growing, along with pictures of our work down here and everything else I wanna save for when I'm an old man with nothing but my memories. Thoughts? I'll include a link to the drive I'm looking at, and I'm open to other suggestions.
 ​
 p,s. I worry slightly for the 8tb because it's not a tlc drive. Is the 8tb good for the long haul?

 The whole setup was super smooth. I was able to quickly injest container logs (docker driver) and the host's raw /var/logs.
 However im now stuck on the alerting part and finding it very complicated to create basic alerting rules using their query language.
 Is there anything out there that's as quick to configure as grafana+loki but also easy to create alerts? I can do shell/python/sql but just dont feel like wrapping my head around their query language because i'll forget it in a month if i dont use it.

QNAP Ethernet Switch
 Zyxel Multi-Gig 12-Port 2-Port 2.5G and 2-Port 10G SFP+ [XGS1010-12]

I originally tried doing this via USB copy to a 7 TB partition of a 14 TB drive in NTFS, which wasn't ideal because I'm using a Mac. This failed after about 6 days of progress, ultimately due to storage issues. I then tried using SSH to connect to the drive and use rsync with the -avPc tags, but it ended up wanting to upload tons of thumbnails for each photo, presumably created by the Diskstation's indexing. What is the best way to complete this task in the most efficient way possible? There is about 400 GB that wasn't transferred during the initial USB copy, and I would also like to confirm via a checksum that all the files were uploaded properly.

 I am want to build a server for my family, but I am lost. Could you help me with guides and tutorials?
 I worked a few years ago with seedboxes to build my own movie library. Today I want to build something similar for my family, but with more functionality, substituting paid apps:
 - Movie Server - Netflix/Prime Video
 - Audio server - Spotify
 - File browser (Preview and navigation) - Google Drive
 - File backup - Google Drive
 - Photo/Video backup - Google Photos
 ​
 My idea is to have some user system so they can log with Google accounts, have separated environments (only sharing movies and audios) and use the apps in theirs phones, accessing the libraries, files, and with automatic backup so they can use my library server, which should be connected with my google account, which is unlimited.

 What i would like to know is the following: 1.) Is it jus plain stupid?
 2.) Pros and cons 
 3.) Where should i start?
 4.) If its a good idea what open source software would you all recommend?

 I have been using Zim (too offline, buggy/impossible exports, not colaboartive), various buggy wikis/markup (too complicated for other school staff, painful to work with non-text), WordPress (too... sick of it after the design change)...

 Should I open the drive up just to check if the head’s not on the disk?

I'm looking for a solution that will index the files, and make it searchable with either a browser or an app if it supports Windows, Linux and iOS. I don't need any features such as sharing, syncing, etc. Nor do I need to do any file management with it, I simply want to be able to search my files from a central database with any device (within my LAN only) and then open the file in its native app. Is there anything like this?
 Edit: I was thinking Sharepoint might work for me except it’s Windows and not FOSS. Are there any non Windows FOSS alternatives to Sharepoint?

 The idea is, since i cant install tailscale on the tv, to set up a proxy server on an old computer where i can install it and make it so the request the tv makes are forwarded to the tailscale network via the proxy server.
 Edit: my isp (same for both my parents and my home) has a NAT system that makes it so plex connects inderectly to my server and not via remote connection, which is why i need tailscale
 Sincerely i dont really know if its doable, but if any of you have some ideas or guides that could help me please share
 PS. I'm still learning so if you can go easy on me thx

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to convert my deceased parent's DVD library. A lot of the DVDs are not made anymore or available on stream. I have a Plex server up and running. I promised I'd do it.
 I feel like I'm spending half my life doing DVD ripping. There are hundreds, and I've already done at least 200. Are there any services? I managed to find someone for the CDs but not the DVDs.
 ADDS: I'd deliver it by car, and DVDs can be thrown away after. I provide the hard drive to upload it to and then can pick-up the hard drive or have it Fedexed at the end.
 Right now, I download what I can and then deal with DVDs when there are no rips or no perfect rips. He did really manage to create a very obscure collection; history series that are extremely obscure and mostly unwanted by people who upload/download. A lot of the stuff available for download when compared to the DVDs has an episode missing or the like. 
 And I still have to digitize the books... oh the books... on the positive, I have a fantastic library at the end.

I have their router/modem combo along with 3 of the xfi pods. Due to this not helping disperse the network across 3 floors too well, we’ve ran lan cables all over the house and I’ve configured two old routers as Access Points. I also run a windows server for plex, wireguard, etc. Could I create an isolated network/AP with say pfsense in docker or a vm and apply pihole here? Ultimately I have not found a way to get around the xfinity devices preset DHCP/dns assigning. This is also my parents house so I don’t have the freedom to opt for a new router/modem combo and the xfi pods are labeled as only working with xfinity all in one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, looking for some ideas here, TIA!
 My ISP, Google Fiber, allows 2 public IPs from upstream DHCP server. I'm using one for regular home use and one for home lab testing.
 Current setting is Fiber jack ---> PoE injector ---> unmanaged TP-Link switch ---> two pfSense boxes (each has its own public IP). Fiber jack gets power from PoE.
 I just got a Cisco SG300-10PP (managed PoE switch) and would like to replace the PoE injector and the TP-Link switch with this Cisco one. However, since it's a managed switch, when I connect it to the Fiber jack, itself will take one public IP from the upstream DHCP server and then only pass the remaining IP to one pfSense box. The other pfSense box is not able to receive a public IP.
 Is there anyway to keep both public IPs for my pfSense boxes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, so I've seen other posts related to this, but not quite covering what I am trying to figure out.
 I am hosting multiple game servers for a group of friends, and I am setting up a reverse proxy to allow subdomains to resolve to different servers. I am running into an issue with one game server, though, as it uses three ports. One for the game itself, one for query, and one for beacon. I have my own domain name, a DDNS service with A records set up and subdomains. What I am trying to figure out is how to configure Nginx to forward game.example.com to three different ports so the beacon and query don't have issues.
 My understanding is that the request will hit my router, trigger the port forwarding to the proxy but still pass through the subdomain then the proxy will redirect that subdomain and ports to the proper server. So like this:
 game.example.com
 V
 Proxy
 V
 XX.XX.XX.XX:game-port
 XX.XX.XX.XX:query-port
 XX.XX.XX.XX:beacon-port
 To make this even more complicated, I am looking at hosting two of the same game servers on the same network and will need to redirect the query and beacon port from game2.example.com to XX.XX.XX.YY instead. I cannot change the beacon and query ports afaik. I am also going to need to know how to do this for other servers as well. Right now everything is set up as port forwarding, but I want to reduce open ports and complexity on my poor router. Bonus points if I can use the same ports for each additional server and have to open fewer ports.
 All these servers, including the reverse proxy, are VMs and everything is locally hosted behind my router. I do have a way to connect from a different connection to test whether or not it works without having to enlist a friend.
 I initially did this as port forwarding, but that won't continue to work as I grow the server.

 SSH with password authentication works alright. I have generated a key in the PEM format since guacamole does not support the newer formats. However, adding the Private Key and password for the key file does not seem to complete SSH authentication.
 ​

 Been getting the following errors within the guacd container logs,
 guacd[667]: INFO: Auth key successfully imported. guacd[667]: ERROR: Host key not found for <hostname>. guacd[667]: ERROR: Host key did not match any provided known host keys. 
 Not sure how guacamole checks for the Host Key and compares it with the SSH server. I also tried adding Public HostKey values in there but it still does not work. Wondering if someone could help me with getting PubKey working for SSH connections. Appreciate any assistance in advance !!

 Edited to clarify: right now when I access the subdomain recipe.example.com, it redirects to the authentik login screen, no matter if I access that locally or externally. Even though my home DNS resolves that domain to 192.168.x.y (the NPM server) while on the LAN. I would like to continue to access thru NPM because it keep the certificates working without browser annoyances. I'd also like to use authentik because I don't like the basic auth with NPM.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd like to secure some services that don't have a login, like simple websites, or tools whose login I don't trust. I could of course use basic auth but managing passwords, especially on mobile or when I want to give access to others, is a bit cumbersome. So I'd like to use existing identity providers like GitLab or Google instead of a purely local user database.
 To integrate the webserver/reverse proxy with the authentication service I would normally use HTTP forward auth.
 Keycloak can use identity providers, but Keycloak doesn't support forward auth. Authelia supports forward auth, but it doesn't seem to support external identity providers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently planning and building an entire network from scratch. I have experience with servers and virtualization, and generally have rough plans and everything I need to begin. The only issues is I have never worked with or had any enterprise routers or switches, and am a bit overwhelmed with choices. I’m also not sure which mediums to use (cat6a, DAC, or fiber). I have looked at and considered Ubiquity, however I’ve heard there are some limitations. I currently have 1 Gb fiber internet, but am planning on upgrading this to 5 Gb in the near future. I know there will be a need for PoE at the edge for various devices (phones, APs, cameras,etc.) I’m aiming to build a 10Gb capable network, at least in the core, but preferably end-to-end, and am planning this out with future proofing and redundancy in mind. However, for the core switches and in the server room, I’m considering 25Gb or higher, there will be many VM hosts, and I will be building a SAN and testing MaaS. Most of the servers have NVme drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First of all, I'm going to post this to r/datarecovery but I thought that I'd try my luck here first.
 I think that I've messed up my backups and need help. I've been dumb enough to make copies of my backups of my files from the first backup that I ever did, and not from the original source. 
 I have now noticed that the original drive the backup I have been using to create the other backups with has a C5, current pending sector count of 56. Since it is a lot of images I have been storing, I have never really checked so they haven't been damaged after each copy made, untill now.
 Many image files have their original name and metadata, but both the preview and the image itself are completley black (image).
 I will admit it, I'm really new to this and have never before thougt about checking my drives health. I have several copies, but they are all made from the broken drive, as said. I can't neither access the files on their original source. Is there anything that I can do?

Sure they stick out a little and it won't be quite as happy that you're not using "official" caddies at POST but that's a whole lot better than having them haging IMO. Of course this only makes sense in a homelab environment given how inexplicably expensive hard drive caddies are but given I have a bunch of gen7 caddies this makes sense for me.

 I've got a Raspberry Pi 4 4gb that I've decided to turn into a small homelab of sorts. Therefore, the plan is as follows:
  
Step 1: Secure the Pi/network
 Step 2: Gateway for the Pi
 Step 3: Work on Pi at work using gateway
 Step 4: Expand the homelab
  
So far, I've installed Docker and Portainer to begin making containers for apps/services, but I'm not sure what I should use to secure the network and the Pi. I want to make the Pi as secure as I can before exposing it to the internet for self hosting and remote access. What would you guys recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Tailscale to make accessing private services easy while not opening up ports to the big scary internet, and it's been working great. But there are a few problems creeping up - namely, that the tailscale iOS app crushes battery, and that in an increasing number of cases the tailscale client will confuse the linux networking stack and actually block off regular internet traffic.
 So I'm thinking of rolling my own wireguard or openvpn. But how can I replicate the DNS features of Tailscale, which are really handy? On any of my devices I can refer to my devices by a single name and they will resolve.
 Here's my question - can you use a public domain and set the DNS servers for that domain to be the local ip of your internal DNS? So, if you're not on the VPN those names don't resolve, but if you happen to be then <hostname>.example.net will be resolved by your private/internal DNS. Then you could also set a search domain so a machine will assume <hostname> is actually <hostname>.example.net
 Anyone done this?

My PI4 running adguard was working fine but did not provide lookups. After some digging, I learned that having primary and alternate DNS servers helps with load balancing and is not there in case of failure of either one. Is this correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to build a server/workstation for virtualization purpose and have some questions. Here is me hoping I get some good advice from the experts.
 I am not looking to get a rackmounted server (though not too opposed to it) as that is too much for my needs (I am fairly comfortable building desktop/workstation, but never dealt with rackmounted servers), so sticking to desktop/workstation type build. I want to run dual xeon setup and have already acquired a matching pair of E5-2699v4. My question is mainly about compatible motherboard and memory.
 I am leaning towards the supermicro X10DRH-IT board for this purpose. Do you think this is a good choice? Or do you recommend something else? I believe this motherboard only takes ECC memory which means I am going to have to acquire some sticks. I am thinking about going with 32GB x 8 = 256GB with option to expand to 512 GB later (by adding more sticks).
 I have looked at some faily inexpansive chinese motherboards (e.g. Machinist X99-D8-MAX) that have m.2 slots (which I prefer) and can take both ECC as well as non-ECC memory but I am not sure if they are reliable or supported for my CPU setup. Or for that matter a good choice.
 How much PSU will I need. Do you think something like a 750W would be sufficient (say with 4 x 3.5 in HDD)?
 Appreciate your help in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I want is a copy program that runs overnight / in a certain time frame, so I can copy a NAS to a backup when the network is not in use. It runs from 11pm to 6am & at 6am it stops transferring until that night. So it doesn't have to be restarted, but pickups up where it left off?
 I know I could use robocopy for starters, then schedule a task to kill it in the morning?
 Anything fanicier? This would be using a Windows host with the NAS shares mapped on the Win box.
 Is there something I could use on UnRAID that would run on the server?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 The HDDs will be part of my self built NAS, which is housed in an old Fractal Design Define R6 - a case that comes with some amount of soundproofing. Unfortunately, in my apartment I don't have any space where noise absolutely does not matter. For now, it will be in the working room, where I and the gf spend significant amounts of time trying to be productive. Because of this, I want to buy HDDs that are the most likely to not annoy us too much. Read/Write performance is a secondary concern, so long as they make full use of my gigabit ethernet connection.
 I've done a bunch of research on this; both in this sub and beyond, and unfortunately there is no drive for which I don't find three different people making five contradicting claims about their noise levels.
 For instance, I've heard a bunch of good things about the Ultrastar DC HC550 drives; but other sources say they produce a thudding noise every five seconds or so, which may or may not be quite annoying.
 I also recently got a good deal on two Toshiba MG08ACA16TE drives which are sitting here unused so far, as I'm considering returning them. I've heard people claim they're rather quiet or really loud.
 It would be helpful to hear from people who have tried different HDDs from different companies and thus can give some sort of comparison. I am also totally open to other models or to shucking, if that's still a thing.
 OS Wise I am likely going with True NAS Core for the NAS, if this has any bearing on the question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I am having issues with my freshly built NAS using TRUENAS Scale. I had an Intel core i7 12700K cpu from a previous build, so I chose to build around that. The other key components are as follows:
  
MSI MAG B660M MORTAR WIFI DDR4
 Corsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (2 X 16GB) DDR4 3600
  
I successfully installed the iso using a usb stick. I’m at the stage where I should be able to access the web GUI. However, the link/ip address is not there and instead reads “The web interface could not be accessed. Please check network configuration”.
 Here are the other options: 1. Configure network interface 2. Configure network settings 3. Configure static routes 4. Change local administrator password 5. Reset configuration to defaults 6. Open TRUENAS CLI Shell 7. Open Linux Shell 8. Reboot 9. Shutdown
 Frankly, I am not very technologically inclined and feel I’ve made a mistake. I’m not sure what I can do. I’ve attempted looking up solutions and they tend to say it’s a problem with the built in Wi-Fi (2.5G LAN and Intel Wi-Fi 6E Solution). I’m in around 5 hours of research and all I’m seeing is possibly getting a Intel NIC. That would be fine, but my home does not have Ethernet. 
 The only thing I can really think of is:
 A) Update the motherboard bios (not sure how to do this given it’s on a NAS os)
 B) Buy a extremely expensive server board with w680 chipset. This would mean spending about 2x the amount of money I already have.
 C) Scrap it and just buy a synology which is still a net negative but at least I know it’ll work. 
 I wanted to be able to mess around with Linux and it’s capabilities but this is beyond frustrating and frankly a bit demoralizing being my first experience with it.

 I want to get into a home lab but have a small budget. I found 2 different dell optiplexes near me for $75 CAD.
 The 790 is upgraded and has a 8tb hard drive and a 240gb ssd with 12gb of ram. The 3010 has a 120gb ssd but is the same price.
 What would be the right choice? should i get the 790 because of the storage and ram then upgrade the cpu?
 Edit: i want to use it as a jellyfin server or a minecraft server for friends

 I'd like to have a data visualization dashboard hosted locally where I can view data (temp/humidity min/max per room, A/C uptime, heat uptime, etc.) over the past few days/weeks.
 tipboard looked very promising but I haven't been able to get it to successfully run anything on either windows or raspberry pi. If anyone has any success with tipboard, I'd love some help debugging this because it looks pretty slick. If not, I'd appreciate any alternatives.

 I've got some coding knowhow, but I'm pretty new to this entire space. Because I've written the logging code myself (python), I can be pretty flexible with interfaces/storage methods

I was thinking of getting regular hard drives and a hard drive toaster rather than external drives. Is there a consensus as to which setup is better?
  
​
  
I need to transfer data between linux and windows computers. I was using the ExFat file system for this. Is this a good idea or is there a better file system?
  
​
  
I was told recently that drives larger than 2TB are far more susceptible to corruption. Is this true? 
  
​
  
What programs would you recommend for data recovery on a hard drive?
  
​
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an ever growing homelab setup picking up used servers locally for way less than market value. My wife of course shakes her head every time another rackmount box is brought home (I plan to sell off some others to make room I swear /s)
 Up until now I've mostly haven't needed the management interfaces like iDrac, IPMI, UPS network port/console, etc. First setup is with an attached keyboard/mouse then installed on the LAN. On the few occasions the box needs attention I go into the basement and address it, sometimes even dragging a monitor and keyboard over if needed. Each time cursing myself for not setting up a private admin LAN to do this remotely from the main floor.
 After reading the post about the publicly exposed iDrac port and shaking my head knowing that's a bad idea, it reminded me it's time for today me to connect my homelab server management ports so tomorrow me is happy. But I don't know where to start.
 Separate physical LAN or VLAN yes of course, no access from the Internet side, but then what? Air gapped until I need access so go into the basement to plug in a network cable? That's painful.
 What's a decent way to setup a homelab management network for iDrac, IPMI, and UPS network ports? I want security but ease of use, it's a homelab not top secret government work.
 How is your homelab Admin Network setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like most of you, I've got tons of hard drives floating around. I've got a good 20+ drives sitting in a bin that I need test and determine if I want to keep or not (most are 4tb-8tb), including some which are shucked drives. For both these and future drives, I've been looking at picking a handy USB dock that I can hook up to my main workstation, and stick drives in from to time to slow clear out the back log. 
 Something like this: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CE65C4W?th=1 , or possibly the two drive version of it. 
 Task-wise, I'm looking at testing the drive, basic power on and SMART tests, pulling data off the drive (not a common occurrence), and securely wiping the drive. Performance is not a real concern at all. 
 Two possible issues with a setup like this, whether I can access the raw SMART diagnostics of the drive and if I'll have any issues with the PWDIS/3.3V pin. I haven't used many USB/SATA bridges over the years, so not sure of the SMART data is a problem or not. 
 Regarding the 3.3V pin, handling it in server/PC/whatever is easy enough. I generally just make sure the power for that pin is disconnected/cut up stream of the drive. Would rather not have to deal with figuring out which drives it will be an issue with and putting tape over the pins. Do USB docks even have power on that pin and/or proper support for it? 
 What are people's experiences with this stuff? Do I need to worry about either thing, any recommendations for or against a given dock/brand would also be appreciated.
 (Searching for info on r/DataHoarder and the rest of reddit didn't provide much solid information on the 3.3V pin with USB dock issue)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I use Joplin as an Evernote alternative. For synching between my phone and my PC, I use my Nextcloud installation within my web server.
 For shared notes, I still use Evernote with my wife. I really dislike Evernote in general. Especially the maximum number of devices in the free account, as well as the WYSIWYG editors and how they format differently on different clients.
 Unfortunately, Joplin doesn't have a sharing function. Because I have a shared website without the possibility to use Docker, I can't install Joplin server and I don't want to use Joplin cloud.
 Therefore, I probably need a different alternative to Joplin which allows sharing.
 I have a basic shared web server where I already run Nextcloud and where I can run other PHP based software.
 I either need really good browser clients for mobile and desktop. Alternatively, I need clients for Android, IOS, MacOS and Linux.
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of my R720XDs motherboards finally bailed after several pink screens of death and I’ve replaced it with an Amazon refurbished MB. It’s all cabled up properly (I compared it with another R720XD to make sure). The two PSUs are lit, the on board network interfaces are lit, and the status light on the back has come on at least once when the room got a bit cold. The replacement MB is “new” and since I can’t turn it on, I haven’t been able to configure the IDRAC so don’t know what it might be set to, IP address and credentials.
 However it won’t power on. Pressing the power on button does nothing. No lights on the front either. I’m probably wrong but the only thing I can think of other than a faulty MB is the IDRAC is configured to disable the power on button. As I’ve never encountered that before, I’m not sure how the system would look if it was in that state, as in would there still be lights on the front or would it be as it is now, dark.
 Anyway, I was searching the ‘net to see if there was a way to physically restore the IDRAC to the factory defaults such as a jumper on the MB but searches have failed. Either no way or my search terms are failing.
 Heck, at this point, it seems like just buying a “new” R720XD will be the optimum solution. The ebay costs are about what I paid for the refurbished MB. But I thought I’d check before pulling that trigger.

 I am hoping there's a script that can point to a mysql database with username and password and it will just display the tables via php or something similar that can be browsed. This is text-only.
 I tried just importing into Airtable to share that way, but there is over one million records so that won't work as they cap at around 50,000 for the Pro account. The database is 1GB when uncompressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Constructive feedback very much appreciated.
 Here is the guide:
 https://medium.com/@goughgough/the-best-way-for-microsoft-teams-users-without-administrator-rights-to-save-export-print-copy-8212aa9e5f11
 TL;DR: To export Teams chat messages without Microsoft Teams admin rights, download Gildas Lormeau's (GL) browser extension at https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/single-file-export-chat.
 By the way, this extension is based on their excellent Singlefile browser extension.
 Assumptions: You are not very tech-savvy.
 You can log into Microsoft Teams in a browser at https://teams.microsoft.com/
 In Teams, you do not have admin rights for a group chat. Nevertheless, you still need to export the messages from that specific group chat.
 You want to use noncommercial software and do the exporting for free.
 You want to export messages from the Chat section (in Microsoft Teams left column). NOT the Team section (in Microsoft Teams left column).
 You wish to export Teams messages in their entirety, including any body text that contains clickable links.
 You want to export Teams messages to a searchable final output rather than an image file.
 You do not want to waste time manually copying and pasting individual Teams messages, which is one of the techniques in quite a few of the online guides. This manual copying and pasting makes sense if you only have a few Teams messages to export.
 You do not want to use the GoFullPage browser extension. Even though it is not as effective as GL’s solutions, it does let you export Teams messages as images (e.g., a non-searchable PDF file). Before I came across GL’s methods, the GoFullPage browser extension was the best method I tried. Unfortunately, the final product is not searchable due to its image format.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a a 1TB SanDisk 520s and I am looking for a solution to expand my storage capacity. Obviously I could just get another 1TB, but then I would then have multiple drives I need to eject when I move my MacBook about.
 Looking at YouTube videos it does look like it has an M2 NVME drive installed, so this got me thinking. For the same price of another 1TB sandisk I can get a 2tb M2 drive.
 Is there some enclose preferably unpowered (or type c) that can hold multiple M2s? I suppose two drives would be ok, but would prefer four. I have looked on Amazon and they either seem to be exposed, too big and also need power.
 Raid capability isn't necessary. Portability is fairly important though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently at a point in my journey where I'm looking to start planning out my storage config for my first homelab. This isn't a post asking EXACTLY what I should do but moreso trying to get a feel for what first timers don't really think about. What are common regrets you've heard or experienced when setting up the storage for homelab for the first time? I'm still deciding how much extra storage I plan on having(I know I need more than 10TB). Still deciding on a file system(I'm definitely leaning towards ZFS). Deciding whether I want to virtualize my NAS or not. For context, I plan on using this lab as part "production"(things like Plex, pihole, Home Assistant and a steam cache) and part testing to get more familiar with all kinds of things, from setting up a Windows domain controller to familiarizing myself with kubernetes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm interested in setting up a CCTV system, 1 security camera only.
 Where I'm at in the middle of nowhere (Australia) there isn't fixed line, and there is barely any data signal with most carriers.
 What I'd like is to have the security camera recording to a local system, let's say a simple computer setup with some HDDs that constantly records with a set retention.
 But I'd also want to be able to remotely view what's happening when I am not at the location, and being limited with internet options (cellular plans only) the cost of 24/7 streaming online would not be viable. So, I thought about a system that: records locally, then every 1 hour (more or less) uploads 1 photo to a cloud service, let's say back blaze (from a portable wifi router connected via SIM). That way, I can look to check to see if there is anything gone occasionally without having to livestream which would use a huge amount of data, and if something did happen, I can go check the local storage and see what exactly happened.
 Ideally, the only monthly costs would be:
 SIM data plan
 Backblaze
 If anyone has some knowledge on what cameras are the best option or how I could achieve this, if i'm on the right track etc please feel free to share!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been really getting into self-hosting world and this sub has played a large part. Initially, I was screwing around with a VPS on Hetzner, just installing packages and hosting containers. This works really great, but I wanted to be able to destroy the env and replicate it on another server with ease.
 This became a pain as I'd forget steps to set things up, etc. Fast forward, I setup Ansible, made a bunch of roles and playbooks and version controlled all my docker config, packages, etc. These playbooks automatically run and deploy from a private Github action over SSH. It's pretty neat because I can setup a fresh VPS with just a couple commands in less than 60 seconds. 
 The downside is I feel the setup is a tad complicated, but not terrible. I chose Ansible because I used in the past and Saltstack (which we use at work) is a massive pain in the ass. Would love to hear how you guys automate things!

 I want to get into hosting a jellyfin server with radar and BitTorrent. I wanted to know if it’s best practice to host jellyfin, radarr, sonar, and BitTorrent on TrueNAS and use the local pools or is it better to run those on proxmox server 1 and use shared nfs drives from server 2 TrueNAS?

 So what am I doing wrong here? Some people say to try flashing on a different box but I tried on a Thinkstation S30 and then on a brand new Ryzen 5 box and get the exact same results?

I can get new Crucial MX500 drives for about the same price and size as used server grade SSD’s from the company I am looking at buying the server from. Given that I don’t know how much data has been written to the used drives, would it be better to have new consumer grade SSD’s, or does the server grade out weigh the question of the data written to the drive already?
 I am looking at loading the 8 bays with 250GB drives in either a ZFS raidz1 or raidz2 configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 ​
 As I don't have a UPS till now (shame on me), I'm planning to buy one. I'm looking to a 1000 or 1500VA model, rackable if possible. My usual load is about 100 W but sometimes, when gaming for example, load could go up to about 800 W. As you know, electricity price is raising in Europe. I read multiple time, some UPS, especially the rackable ones are drawing up to 50 W by themself, at idle (batteries charged), so in my case about half of my usual load... And if I take the efficiency percentage, with a let's say 1000VA, 980W, 97% efficiency, if I understood well, it means, max about 30W for the self consumption.
 ​
 Did you ever measure the self consumption of your UPS ? 
 Which models (SmartUPS vs Back UPS pro or Ellipse Pro vs 5PX...) have the smallest self power consumption ?
 Is form factor affecting the self power consumption (tower vs rack like the APC SMT 1500) ?
 ​
 Thanks a lot

Needless to say, owning a server and getting it up and running has been a huge learning experience (some painless some painful but I still love it all of course). I've finally reached the final stage of hardware changes before the server is fully operation and I would love some advice on my final hardware change involving IT Mode vs stock RAID Card and whether or not I need both.
 ​
 Just some disclaimers, this is a homely server for learning and self hosting and I intended on running/hosting:

 I turn on the Switch using a Smart Power Plug.

 Is there any way we can avoid this issue?

 Been lurking here for a while, this is my first post here and wanted to get this community's opinion before making a purchase I think might be a good one. Recently I've been trying to recycle every spare pc part I have in the closet prior to a move so I get an idea of what's worth salvaging and what's garbage. Since I'm selling mostly via the facebook marketplace, I couldn't help but browse every so often. And then I found this... An X8DTL with 2 Xeon cpu and 32gb of ddr3 ram. It's listed for 50 bucks but considering I'm running a 2 core, 8 year old intel cpu that doesnt even support VT-d, I'm not sure if it's cheap because its not efficient or did I get somewhat lucky?
 Links to details in the pictures.
 Thanks in advance for any words of wisdom.
 ​
 P.S. I'm a newbie in the sense that I mainly want to run a media server and a "guest gaming pc" which is why I made reference to the VT-d.

 According to some research I have already done, the software is "DSView3" but I can't find it anywhere and the new version "DSView 4.5" costs a hell of a lot of money. 
 My question here would be, is it worth keeping it as a local KVM switch (even though I don't own a PS2 keyboard or mouse yet) or is it a case for someone elses Homelab?

 I turned off my R730 and I am noticing every 5 min I can hear the fan for 2 seconds then goes silence again.
 ​
 I guess this has something to do with iDRAC.

 Where is this "turn on fan every 5 min" setting when the server is turned off ?

 I like to game on one monitor and halfheartedly watch videos on the other in the evenings, and I wanted to see if there was a way I could consolidate all 389 GB of my locally stored video files into a single playlist that can play them randomly.
 I made the attempt with VLC, but it chokes on it about halfway through adding the files to the playlist. I don't know if there is a numerical limit, or if it goes by file size, not sure. Is there another application, extension, or maybe something out there in GitHub world that you know of that can accomplish this?
 I really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance!

 I am trying to access my home network from outside. I am behind a CGNAT. To resolve the issue I have a VPS from Digital Ocean running Wireguard server and another VM in my home lab running Wireguard client.
 The configuration is as follows:
 Server Config:
 [Interface] PrivateKey = Address = 192.168.69.1/24 ListenPort = 51820 PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE [Peer] # This is the local VM in my network that initiates the connection (Peer 1) PublicKey= AllowedIps=0.0.0.0/0 PersistentKeepalive=25 [Peer] # My Phone PublicKey= AllowedIPs=192.168.69.3/32,10.116.1.0/24 [Peer] # My laptop PublicKey= AllowedIPs=192.168.69.4,10.116.1.0/24 
 Configuration of Peer 1:
 [Interface] PrivateKey = Address=192.168.69.2/32 [Peer] PublicKey = Endpoint = mypublicserverIP:51820 AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0 
 Configuration of Laptop is almost the same as Peer 1
 - My issue is that I cannot access the internal LAN (10.116.1.0) from my laptop. I am going crazy. Can someone explain what is wrong with my configuration?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello home labers,
 Currently I have a cheap VPS acting as my main website/mail server however I would like to move the mail server to my homelab later this year. I'm looking at using the NGINX mail proxy directive to redirect from my current VPN to my home lab mail server.
 ​
 I would like to setup the proxy_cache directive on the mail server part in case my home lab goes offline for whatever reason but I'm not sure if it is needed or if it even supports the smtp protocol since most examples I can find only seem to apply to http/https traffic.
 ​
 Currently I haven't gotten around to testing it but I'm curious what happens to the mail if its accepted by the NGINX proxy but the upstream mail server (my homelab) is offline, will it be automatically cached until it can be passed to the server or will it just get lost or bounced back.
 ​
 Note: I'm still in the planning stage but hopefully will get even moved over in the next week or 2 once I get a UPS setup at home and a few other things done.

 I woke up this morning to an alert for one of my work servers going offline for 5 minutes. After an investigation, I found a Monero miner running that shouldn't have been there, and no clear way as to how it got there. What's weird is the server has secure users and an IP-based ACL, so it didn't make sense that it was compromised.

 I raised a ticket to my DC provider to let them know that we'd been breached, with some information and to let them know that I'd found a couple of other of their servers in a list of miners pointing at the wallet. They came back and said they'd had a load of new tickets rai…]]></summary>

 Thanks for the fast answers! At the end I decided by Porkbun because on reddit have better customer service and I found a porkbun coupon that made 1 usd cheaper, hence, more cheap than Cloudflare.

I've swapped in two of them so far, and the SMART data looks good, but only show 25 and 15 power on hours and a start/stop count of 2. Assuming I trust the seller, does anyone know if Seagate resets SMART data when they refurbish drives? I know a lot of these drives may have never seen much or any actual use before they were rejected for one reason or another, but I'm curious if these *really* are low mileage or if Seagate reset the stats.
 By the way, I have to say Server Part Deals was great to deal with. They really do ship these things well, and they shipped them fast. Thanks for the recommendation!

Is this a bad idea? I understand that performance may be affected which is fine with me since I rarely game to begin with. Is it realistic / a good idea to build a server running Windows?
 PS : I want to run Nexcloud, Plex or Jellyfin, and Radarr and Sonarr etc...
 EDIT : Would you recommend a Raspberry Pi?

I have a 14TB drive I partitioned to 7TB for NTFS and the other 7TB to Mac OS Extended. I was using the USB Copy app since rsync was going to take to long but after getting to about the final 300GB or so it ran out of space. Now realizing I should have just given myself more space to work with is there any way to resume where the data transfer left off?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody,
 I recently set up half a dozen RHEL VMs on a Intel NUC KVM host, using the RH developer subscription program to get free subs.
 Now, by default the RHEL machines fetch their updates from https://cdn.redhat.com/content/ and I was wondering if anybody here has ever tried to mirror that with Pulp or something similar?
 I know that I could achieve the same with a RH Satellite, server but it seems a bit overkill to purchase a license just for home-labbing.
 TLDR; will Pulp work with Red Hat's CDN repos?

 The cable
 The input
 I've searched through google for what cable it could and i've seen nothing that resembles it. I haven't got much knowledge of these sorts of cables, some websites are saying its a VC-VDV204U DV (Firewire) Cable and other spec sites are listing it as a regular firewire cable but it doesnt look like either. Thanks for any info

I plan to install them alongside jellyfin in the same LXC (Ubuntu server in this case). But the thought occurred to me that I could add another LXC on the same node and put the new services there, or even spin up a new LXC for each individual service.
 I don't fully understand why you'd use one method over the other, except that using only one LXC has less overhead. But why might you want to use multiple LXCs? Please help this beginner understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My apologies in advance if this has been asked before, nothing turned up in my search...
 As I continue to expand my homelab with Docker, I am starting to run into different containers that expose their User Interfaces on the same TCP port. 
 ​
 Is there some utility that I can use to keep track of the used exposed ports on my host? I know that I can query Docker, but that list does not get returned in a nice sorted table. I've started a quick Google Doc spreadsheet, but this seems clumsy too, as I have to manually tell it to sort when I'm looking for a candidate port to expose on the host.
 By the way, all this is internal, nothing exposed outside my home network.
 Does anyone have some suggestions? I was thinking Netbox, but it seems a little overkill....
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone I'm looking for reccomendations for different useful software/bootable usb flash drives to have. I have experience with Kali Linux, Hirens, and use a ghost boot drive at work for imaging computer. I'm looking for things related to pentesting, hacking, and general "toolkits" items that help with everyday or advanced computer stuff. I have looked at pfsense for my network. I'm looking to have a few different usb drives that have different functions and then I'll probably have an external drive that holds vm's, OS iso's, random tools like putty, etc.
 Things I would like to experiment with:
 Some sort of File Recovery/System restore program
 Might be a little overkill but I like the idea of a security drive where my computer won't work without it (or retrofit something with my car if I install a push to start)
 Drive cloning

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a massive datahoarder but got interested when I realised I had several old Windows profiles I'd backed up over the years. Thought I had issues until I found this subreddit. I also feel I fully justified why I started saving bits and pieces. I used to watch ITIdiots back in the day until they gave it up as they weren't making money from it. I'd managed to download pretty much all their videos they'd done (sadly not much of their mac videos as have/had no interest in Apple) until one day they disappeared for a bit. Turns out, if I remember right, they were with 123reg and it was the only place they had copies of their videos. 123reg had a big outage with corrupt backups so no data could be restored so they lost them all. Thats when I actually did something with my YouTube channel and just stuck them all on there. Even offered to send them a copy on Blu-ray which Nick was interested in but then never heard back.
 Now of course, they can just run yt-dlp on my channel to grab them.

 I have a small issue, I ran out of bootdisk space on a DietPi VM image I imported in Proxmox (Following the offical guide for DietPi in Proxmox).
 This happened to me before and I (somehow) managed to increase it in the shell of my VM... The thing is, it took me ages to do because I'm no expert and did not have a proper explanation on how to do it.
 Is there someone which can help me which some links to the commands I have to type or a guide of some sort ?
 Disk size is 16gb and I woul like to increase to 50gb.
 Thanks a lot!
 Kevin

 Can anyone recommend a self hosted tool (docker ideally) that is best placed to store and manage all of my product manuals / user guides , tech documents etc. 
 I’m sure like many of you, I’ve accrued numerous pdfs over the years for the various appliances I’ve acquired, and so far I’ve looked at paperless-ngx and Komga which both seem possible but I’m curious what other might use (or recommend). 
 Everything is currently stored in a basic folder/file structure `Manufacturer > Product` which is functional, but I’m thinking the addition of OCR could help, especially if I want to find specific terms, error messages etc. Please let me know what you use for this or recommend .. 
 Many thanks ..

 I have been looking at some popular options like Wallabag, Linkding, Shiori, Cherry. etc
 It seems like either you have a useful management interface for thousands of bookmarks like Cherry, or you have the function of saving pages offline manually with something like Shiori.
 One key feature I am looking for is full text search of archived pages.
 Can you share with me which solution you use?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day fellow hoarders. 
 After getting fed up of Cloud services such as Google Drive and their bugs and bills, I have now decided to store and hold on to every bit and byte of my personal and professional data on a Network Attached Storage. A few answers if you could please:
 1.) Am I on the right track? Is NAS the right solution to become independent of cloud services? Or does there exist any other method or tech or hardware for doing so?
 2.) Synology? Did my fair share of research and seems like a good choice to go hardcore on data hoarding. Are there any ones better than this brand? 
 3.) Apart from the standard media and files I would want to store literally everything like passwords and WhatsApp backup on my NAS. Is it possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So here is my situation: I’m looking to backup personal documents to the cloud. Google Drive, One Drive or iCloud. I now see that iCloud has End to End encryption which is a big plus. However I’m a mac and windows user and an iPhone and android user. That means I need some way to access files on any device. I decided to upload an encrypted zip file to Google drive which is available on all platform. I’m using Keka on MacBook as multiple users have suggested. However after looking at their website they mention : “Using AES-256 encryption specification for your 7z files and Zip 2.0 legacy encryption specification for your Zip files.” from which I understand that only the 7z format is protected by AES-256. How do I verify which encryption the compressed folder is using? What would be a cross platform suggestion? Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, I'm after some help the other night we lost power for 5hrs due to a storm. I've powered on my Dell PowerEdge T420 afterwards and was going to run the script to reduce the noise of my fans, though my iDrac isn't getting an IP Address anymore, everything else on my network is. I've found that if I use the front panel and view IDRAC IP it does give a IP Address which is on the correct range that I'd be expecting, though I'm unable to ping it from any device.
 Should I just reset the iDrac to defaults and is there any risk in resetting to defaults, I've had bad experiences with iDrac before so don't want to risk bricking it.
 Thank you in advance.

I currently use dockerized Dokuwiki and It's very nice but good and I like its simplicity but got few issues. The biggest problem I found is lack of SEO customization and manual html tagging ovverride create mess that some socials read, some don't, also search engines got problems.
 So I'm looking for alternative. I need: - Metatags customization for each pages. - High theme/looks customization - SEO support - Something modern with active development/community 
 Any suggestions -^ ?
 (Already tested and rejected the XWiki (niceurl don't work) and WikiJS(lack of theme customization and manual css is messed up because of lots of !important)

 I also have a Unifi 16 Port PoE Switch and AC-Pro AP. Driving the network was pfsense, a VM on ESXi ( basically presented HW mode ) which I passed through some of the I350 interfaces like they were physical ( SR-IOV ) and performance was good, but Pfsense is my first reason for the move.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a few dockers using a mixture of Mariadb, Postgres and REDIS. 
 I didn’t get the memo about separate db instances per docker and to be honest I’m not sure my aging NUC would benefit from multiple db instances either. 
 I’ve been working on a backup strategy, and I can group the dockers with the db so I can update each app (Nextcloud, photoprism, various random php systems, phpmyadmin) as needed, 
 However I have two apps using a REDIS instance. Nextcloud (as above) and paperless. 
 When I look back at the REDIS docker there are no volumes defined. So I’m not sure what I need to actually backup with REDIS. 
 Maybe it’s loaded as values on client docker startup so it doesn’t need backups? 
 Or there is something permanent I should be backing up and my docker should be updated to create those files as permanent files which I can then backup. 
 Does anyone have any knowledge of REDIS and how I should handle this?
 Thanks in advance

 What's the best way to go about doing that? I have a DSLR camera, but cropping hundreds of photos manually is rather inefficient. Is there some type of scanner I can get for this? Like something with a scanning bed maybe (feed-through seems like a bad idea)

 Not sure exactly what resolution I need, but I'd almost certainly want a minimum of 4k

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. Not sure if this is the best subreddit for this kind of question but here we go anyway.
 I would like to combine all my drives (NVME SSDs, SATA SSDs and spinning rust HDDs) into a single tiered pool, where the NVME takes care of the most used files, the SATA SSDs take care of the majority of files and the HDDs act as "hot archive", taking care of the files I very rarely use. Backups would go on a separate file server.
 I currently have a 500GB NVME SSD partitioned into two 250GB partitions and use a 500 GB SATA SSD and a 1TB SATA SSD as a storage pool. I'm planning on adding an 4TB HDD as well.
 Like I said, preferably I would like to have everything in one singel "drive" with Windows intelligently allocating the files depending on frequency of use.
 Is it possible to do this in Windows 10/11?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friends and I go on roadtrips pretty frequently, and the other day I had the idea that it would be great if one of us could hook our phone up to the radio, and everyone else use their phones to connect and add music to the queue, maybe even vote music up to listen sooner. I've been looking into mopidy, but I'm not sure if its possible the way i want it. I dont mind using local music, as I have quite a few songs, but I like that mopidy can use other sources as well. 
  
 Can anyone tell me if what I seek is possible, if not with mopidy, possible something else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a port open at home to a reverse proxy with a wildcard dns and services behind sso. This made sense as I was advised to not make a cert for each application as they can be enumerated. However I am left with an open port. 
 I was thinking well maybe I’ll use cloudflared for all of these subdomains but if I’m not mistaken I’d then have to have each as a cname in the dns to the tunnels record which means they’re all listed. Although I’d keep the wildcard dns, and no extra hardware and no open port to the house. 
 If I go the vps route I can have wildcard dns, no ports open internally (through con connectivity from vpn to home) but is it really any different to having a local port open, having one open to another machine that I now pay for and have to keep updated etc outside the house. 
 Which of these things can I safely ignore, given I want these services to be available without vpn to people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to work for an enterprise storage vendor. I wrote test software that could hit 75GB/s. I know a thing or two about speed. With the new Zen4 X3D chips being confirmed, I plan to build myself a nice little NAS to hold my movies, music, and blockchains (BTC and XMR). I've been considering writing my own storage software for a while. My own personal goals are:
  
ZFS or LVM Pool-like operation (as in, tell it what drives to use, and it packs the drives full of capacity)
 Much easier and more intuitive redundancy (setting 'copies=2' will mean that two different drives, preferably on different storage controllers, have your data; no more vdevs!)
 Automatic de-duplication at a block level.
 SSD-first mentality (spinning rust is ok, but I'd rather have a filesystem designed from the ground up to support 550MB/s to each individual drive)
 Support for an Optane or battery-backed up config mode where write-through caching is allowed for maximum write performance. (have 10 550MB/s drives? Enjoy 5.5GB/s writes!)
 Block-based performance teiring? (Actually, probably won't do this, or would do it in a different product. Conflicts with core design I have in mind).
  
I have 0 manufacturing connections or experience, so selling a pre-built NAS is not in my scope. But what are some storage features you wish existed or were easier?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built my gaming PC in 2008 and still use it as my primary desktop. I mostly do photo editing and I'm finally ready to replace it since NVMe drives will really speed up my process.
 This got me thinking about finally building a NAS/Plex server. I have about 15TB of data already (mixed between photos and movies) scattered about on various internal and external drives and it's truly a mess. As my photography has become more storage intense (currently running a Sony A1), I'm running out of space with my current setup and I'm tired of buying externals.
 Is my hardware okay for the job? My PC is built with an ASUS Sabertooth P67 board and a Sandy Bridge i7 2600K with 16GB of RAM that has been rock solid since I first built it. My thought is to pull it out and put it in a case with room for at least 5 drives (or hotswap bay) and to run it with TrueNAS on a small SSD. Since I think I would only need to buy the new case, this would be the most budget-conscious decision and I could put my money towards new drives.
 Is this a dumb idea? Is my hardware just too old? I'm willing to invest in something new if I must, but I'm also okay with running this until it dies and then replacing whatever needs to be replaced. Should I be looking in another direction entirely? Thank you kindly for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I want to find the right NAS that is not too expensive. Of course DS220+ is better, but with a higher price, so I also consider DS220j which may be enough for us.
 My wife has DS214se, but as far as I remember, it was never fast enough for my liking (I didn't care at the time because I don't really use it and it's hers).
 Purpose
  
Home storage: Mainly family photos, and documents.
 Work storage: As a graphic designer, the files are not that big. Some time can be up to 2-4 Gb.
 We don't really have movies, big media files like 4k, etc. or music files. So, somehow not really anything to stream out from it (if that's the term?)
 We plan to use 2x WD 2TB Red Plus NAS HDD 5400RPM from my wife's Synology DS214se, is that good?
 Will DS220j stay good for a while before becoming obsolete?
 Mainly I'd love a nice responsive storage/server to move/save files around, especially for work.
  
Do you think the DS220j would already be enough for us? the price is much better than 220+ where I live. Thanks everyone!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'm fairly new to home networking, and I've had a hard time solving this one myself. I'd love if someone could help me out.
 I have a few http services running locally:
  
Splunk on port X
 An API on port Y (using Python)
 A website on port Z (using Node)
  
I want to reach them from:
  
My local network
 My AWS servers
 My phone when I'm on cellular data
  
I forwarded their ports and hid them behind an IP whitelist. This works for 1 & 2, but it breaks for 3. When my cell's IP changes I lose access to these services.
 Is it possible to protect them with BasicAuth so that I don't need an IP whitelist?
 And before anyone suggests it: I don't want to use a VPN. I hate having to toggle it on before accessing a service, then toggle it off afterwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 About two years ago I created a very simple Excel sheet for my mum to keep track of the grocery shopping receipts. Now time has passed on and the end-user (mum) is asking for more features :)
 Instead of turning the Excel sheet into an application I decided to look around for what may exist.
 Requirements
  
Add different supermarkets (e.g. as categories)
 Add entries per day or receipt
 Support for negative values e.g. discount
 Search function across entries to find the same product prices across supermarkets
 Optional: Create a graph showing expenditures per supermarket per time-period
  
Not all too fancy if you ask me. So I looked around and found a few options but none really fulfill the needs, In random order what I looked at:
  
Grocy
 I already use this for myself as shopping and recipe keeper. Not really fit for tracking receipts as you require the products to be added.
 Paperless-ngx
 This is really a DMS rather than comparing supermarket receipts
 Firefly iii
 This looked the most promising but is too strict from an accounting point of view as it works on debit/credit basis and in my case there is no bankaccount. Still keeping it in the back of my mind just in case.
 Smart receipts
 This is more for tracking full receipts rather than itemised
 Receipt Parser Web
 This lacks search and looks unmaintained. My Python skills are non-existent to extend it :) In its essence it comes closest to what I have in mind
  
Perhaps this is all out there but would love to hear if anybody has other ideas.
 If all else fails I might code something myself :)
 Thank you for your input

I have seen a video about a Raspberry Pi as a NAS but it was too complicated with Linux, consoles, SSH and very difficult RAID setup. I don't want to deal with stuff like drive pools or VMs I just want to safe money and power (which is money again). I think I would like to use RAID 1 or SHR. I like that I can use different old drives for SHR and add more drives in the future. I think 4 TB total capacity are enough to begin with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all.
 I would like to utilize the power of wifi6 in my new network setup. I am therefore looking to buy 3 pieces of TP-Link EAP670.
 It has 2.5Gb port with PoE.
 I'd like to setup multiple SSIDs linked to specific VLANs.
 But, as much as I am looking around, I cannot find reasonably-priced 2.5GbE switch with management.
 I found a lot without management, though.
 Is it possible to pass through VLAN tags through unmanaged switch?
 The idea would be to plug the WiFi APs to some relatively cheap TrendNet or NetGear switch and from that switch I would grab the traffic to my Zyxel managed switches.
 But if the tagged packets do not get through, this makes little sense...
 Anyone can advise if this is possible?

 I've recently upgraded my NAS to a larger server and to transfer from my old Freenas box I used a one time snapshot, like you might do if you were setting up a backup server, since it seems to work pretty cleanly.
 The transfer completed so I now have what appears to be a copy of the data on both sides, and the sizes match up (17.79TB on one side, 17.8TB on the other). But before I delete the snapshot and start working with this as my primary system I'd like to see what the best practices would be to verify there wasn't any corruption during the transfer. 
 Thinking I could use rsync to verify the files on both sides, but wondering if there's anything deeper I could do to verify nothing got messed up. It's a wide variety of files so I know there's probably not a simple "Are any files corrupt" scan I could do, any thoughts?
 Thanks,

 I would like to create functional offline copies of these websites so if they get taken offline permanently, they'll still be accessible to the community at large.....but I've never done anything more advanced than use 4KDownloader to monitor YouTube channels before. 
 Where do I start? I'm reading Wayback Machine's site, but I don't really know what I'm doing.

Intrigued to hear some people are still using the unlimited accounts, I decided to sign up for a Google Workspace Enterprise Standard account and see what if anything was being enforced. 
 20 USD a month - capped at 5TB. If you have 5 accounts on the 1 plan you are entitled to request additional storage above the 5TB however this needs to be approved by google and incremental storage upgrades are available. Just wanted to put this out there with the chance it might help someone.

I have important data on it..i kept it all these years because i very rarely use it...maybe once a week to add new data..and thought it can last a lifetime under such conditions.
 If the 14 year old drive gets data corruption...will it transmit corrupted data to the newer backup HDD? Or is the data safe in such a case (because it is twice-weekly copied to the backup hdd?)?
 I would replace the drive but it was such a bother to automate the twice-weekly backup to the other drive..

It stopped working after few days? I'm logging in, authentik redirect user back to cf, but cf shows error Authentication Error Failed to fetch user/group information from the identity provider.
 Is it even possible to set ONE app/provider on authentik side and use it with multiple apps on cf side? Or i would have to setup multiple providers/apps in authentik? For each cf app?

My job is technical strategy and thus my technical knowledge is more broad than deep, so I would rate myself as a below average sysadmin and I copy-and-edit rather than write the code. I'm also keen that this doesn't take over my life - I have a job already - so when I work on my home systems I want 90+% of the time to be fun and learning, not administration and troubleshooting just to keep the whole edifice running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay, I admit this is more "small time data hoarding" but I hope you might be able to help nevertheless. I'm looking for a "newbie friendly" backup-software.
 I finally convinced my girlfriend that it might be a good idea to do a backup of her laptop once in a while and now I'm looking for the right software for the job. Nothing fancy or professional - just that she has a copy of here most important documents if her laptop should fail. Since I'm not a windows user I've no idea where to start. I've taken a look at the Wiki, but all recommendations seem a bit to complicated/professional for my case. These are the requirements:
  
Windows Software for local Backups to external USB-Drive (she doesn't want tom put her data into a cloud)
 Easy to use, should take care of everything once set up
 Should work gracefully with an removable hard-drive (best case: should keep quite if disk is not connected and do a backup when she is at home and connects the drive)
 Open Data Format - In case of an emergency I want to be able to pull files from the backup without having to install the software again
 should look reasonably "pretty" - yeah, I know... But I also know that she will not use it, if it looks ugly/complicated/dated
  
So basically just a tool that regularly checks for changed files and copies them to the disk. Any tipps what I should get for her? (I know that this is not a perfect failsafe Backup-Strategy, but I think it is the best I can get her to do).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 anybody interested in collecting / building an so-to-say opposite to sso.tax?
 A community effort listing those projects and services (and their respective usecase) that feature a delightful, free and enterprise ready SSO (SAML / OIDC) implementation.
 Preferably free - but also those vendors and projects demanding reasonable prices & good implementations.
 I hope something like this does not already exist. At least I wasn't able to find something comprehensive. But if it does, I will gladly take your recommendations :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current house comes with a server room-- yeah, it's really the walk in closet for my bedroom, but the comms panel is there so I have data, power, there's an overhead vent for cooling, and I can't hear my server running if I shut the door. 
 I tossed a server with 32GB of ECC onto a shelf in there and now have an excuse to have a NAS. Time to start shopping for more drives and feed the addiction. 
 I'm thrilled that running headless, the server burns 18W with an 80+ gold unit. Now just to get some drives to shuck, a UPS, and I guess I need to admit defeat and buy a case. Right now I'm justifying the expense of getting the server going because it has homeassistant running on proxmox, I'm in the process of getting trueNAS going in another VM on the server so I don't have to burn more power.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Namecheap has recently suspended my domain for "abuse" even though I have just been using it to access photos on my nas at home. Now they are demanding that I give them a reason for registering the domain. Is this a Namecheap thing or do all registrars require you to provide a reason. Are there other registrars that just sell you the domain and leave you alone without wasting your time over bs like this?
 They also locked my account for "suspicion" a day earlier and asked for sensitive info like SSN and DOB to prove my identity. They did not give a proper reason for doing so and threatened to delete my account in 24 hours.
 Edit: For those wondering the TLD is .xyz
 Edit 2: I told them that I was using it for "accessing a NAS" and they unsuspended the domain. However, I asked them in two different replies to provide me with a reason for suspension, or a copy of the abuse report. They completely ignored that part of the email twice, and replied as though those words were invisible. So now I am left in the dark as to what really happened behind the scenes and can only speculate.

 What is HomelabAPI?
 HomelabAPI is a self-hosted API that you can use to consolidate all of your homelab notifications and other outputs. This allows you to use HomelabAPI as your central input/output hub, and if you ever want to change where your homelab outputs go, it's just a matter of updating your HomelabAPI configuration.
 For example, let's say that you have all of your Home Assistant, Syn…]]></summary>

This allows you to use HomelabAPI as your central input/output hub, and if you ever want to change where your homelab outputs go, it's just a matter of updating your HomelabAPI configuration.
 For example, let's say that you have all of your Home Assistant, Syn…]]></summary>

I have seen the ICON USB Ravens (at $1200 each - Nope) and Optical Displayport cables. Was wondering if anyone has seen a device that runs over Fiber with Single in/Single out 'KVM' for remote workstations.
 Full Story:
 My 16 yo and 12 yo each have decent gaming rigs in their shared bedroom (R5 5600x's, RX6800's, Samsung G5 32in 1440P curved displays and secondary 24in 108P portrait displays for each). Been monitoring Home Assistant and even shut off the damper for HVAC going to their room and it gets HOT in there. Ecobee remote sensor shows 78-80 with the ceiling fan on and door open over Christmas break (again with no HVAC input). The rest of the rooms with sensors show 69-71 with the Ecobee set to 70. In NE Ohio so during the winter I guess its manageable but in the summer its near unbearable.
 What I would like to do is move their towers both down to my 'Server Room' (converted fruit cellar in the basement) with my rack and core infrastructure. House is wired with 6A in the walls but I did put conduit in with pull strings to the attic so pulling OM4 to their workstations isn't out of reach. Also since these are gaming rigs and not productivity workstations, would like to keep high refresh rate and low latency. (One can dream - right?)
 Thin clients may work with something light weight - but would rather local connection and not have to go out of the internal net (Looking at you Parsec).
 I'm guessing most of us manage gear over IMPI/SSH/Web interfaces but figured someone somewhere may have rack mounted their PC and is doing something similar to what I am trying to do.
 Thanks for any and all suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy HomeLabbers!
 I received a Dell R730XD with the H730P RAID controller today. I want to run ProxMox and then a bunch of stuff on top (TrueNAS, VMs, etc, etc)
 When I received it it was configured with 2 virtual disks (boot = 6TB, storage = 60TB)
 I have installed ProxMox on the boot "array", however I cannot see the "storage" array. In my research I have found that apparently ProxMox and other systems do not like hardware RAID controllers. 
 Any suggestions on the path forward? It seems I can turn the controller "off" making it a "dumb" HBA--where would I find information on that topic? I havent been able to locate it.
 Can I delete the 60TB virtual disk and still boot via the 6TB array? IM ok with doing that if I have to "pass through" the individual disks...if that will even work.
 Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Which data rate can I expect with this module ?
 Which model of SFP do I have to choose to have a good compatibility ?
 The PCIe data rate is 40Gb/s, right ?

 There are most likely things missing, or that will be added in future.

 Justification for the media servers running on windows server, that specific VM will have a gpu passed through for OBS and I would like to accelerate transcoding for media server stuff with a gpu.
 Any ideas or reccomendations would be great!

I have a desktop PC with 12 HDD slots, Only 5 of them i think are in use atm but want to eventually store all the data from all available slots on Backblaze, Is it feasable or do you think they could decide to terminate my account based on excessive storage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an internally hosted DNS resolver running on my network. Everything is great aside from one thing, which is I cannot load my root domain when connected over VPN. The reasoning is obvious because the zonefile maps my domain name to the internal IP of NGINX which has a ton of subdomain entries for my domain. 
 thing1.mydomain.com <- works thing2.mydomain.com <- works mydomain.com <- does not work. Specifically want to load this website from outside my network. 
 Ideally, I have a CNAME entry in the Zonefile that routes traffic, even on VPN to my site hosted externally by Cloudflare. How can I achieve this? 
 Here is my zonefile
 $ORIGIN mydomain.com. @ 3600 IN SOA sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. ( 2017042746 ; serial 7200 ; refresh (2 hours) 3600 ; retry (1 hour) 1209600 ; expire (2 weeks) 3600 ; minimum (1 hour) ) * 3600 in A 172.16.0.2 # this is private static IP I assigned to NGINX on internal network mydomain.com. 3600 IN CNAME proxy.mydomain.com. 
 The A record is good. I just added this CNAME but it does a loopback into NGINX and loads the wrong site. 
 proxy.mydomain.com is a CNAME record in Cloudflare DNS that points to mydomain.com. Doesn't work when connecting over VPN though. Maybe someone with some solid networking knowledge can explain this one to me.

I would like to use Nvidia Surround in order to combine the screens together into 1 super duper screen for when I play games. Problem is there is a giant bezel in the middle. I can physically flip 1 of the screens 180 degrees but nvidia surround does not allow me to flip only a single screen and combine them together (trust me, I've tried everything). 
 ​
 Is there some kind of adapter/box I can get that lets me flip the output before it hits the screen? 
 ​
 And before you comment "why didn't u just get the Odessy Arc, its cus the pixel density on that thing sucks and this rig is primarily for video editing which benefits workflow-wise from having it set up as 2 physical separate screens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have been running a couple applications behind a reverse proxy. I have been using NPM and it's worked well. I never did implement fail2ban or Authelia into my current setup. I do plan on implementing fail2ban this weekend when I do my server move but I have a couple questions. 
  
When it comes to Authelia, am I correct to assume it's mainly to secure applications which may not have it's own authentication method? I mean, I know you can have a double login (one for Authelia + one for the app) but that seems like maybe it's a little overkill. Am I missing anything else about Authelia?
 I saw at least one post when I was searching which suggested using CF Tunnels to protect the nGinx login. This got me thinking if there is any benefit for using Tunnels in some fashion along with my reverse proxy? Id prefer to not use Tunnels completely because I don't want CF to have unfettered access to everything coming and going from the site so Ill stick with using the reverse proxy with my own cert from lets encrypt. 
  
Anything else Im missing? I guess since Im doing this move I want to increase the security if I can. At a minimum it seems like fail2ban is a no brainer. 
 I'll also add in closing that these apps need to be publicly accessible to the wider internet so something like tail scale is not an option for this.

 Deepnote offers to share your code + the output as an embedded html (iframe) object. Examples of these embedded objects can be seen, for example, in this medium post under 4. I am looking for a self-hosted app that offers the that functionality. 
 To clarify, I am not looking for just embedded code blocks, like Github and Gitlab offer with Gists and Snippets, but also, or even only, where you can see code output. I mainly use Python. So code output in Python would be a must.
 Does anybody know of such a selfhosted app?
 Thanks alot!

 Apache guacamole is a remote administration tool that lets you access servers via the browser (ala citrix, but better). Guacamole is used in enterprise remote access solutions around the world and is a fantastic tool!

My other options is the 2TB WD Black drive and then I’ll have to buy an enclosure/dock to power it. It’s a 7200 rpm drive and speeds are over triple the LaCie. Both setups cost around $100. I just don’t know if the enclosure will slow speeds being there are several enclosure options for 3.5 drives.

 Any solutions, also one that doesn't care about inactivity, as I won't be doing much accessing the files, it's purely for backup purposes as currently I'm running on a ticking time bomb as I have nothing backed up.

So I tried to call customer support but it just says every rep is busy. Then I try to make a support ticket, but their site is broke so I can't even put one in. I'm wondering if anyone had the same experience with customer support.
 ​
 Also how long does it normally take to get a shipping notification? It's been almost a week, and I paid extra for UPS 2 day shipping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using dstat to check my drive usage to see if it would be feasible to have them spin down (if you want to comment on this then see my other recent post in here).
 I'm not using LVM for anything as Proxmox is installed onto a ZFS mirror and I've already added each drive to the global_filter in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf, which should prevent vgscan from accessing those drives.
 However I'm still getting regular activity on all my drives. One set of accesses happen at ~15 minute intervals, which appears to read ~247 bytes from each drive. The other set of accesses occur at ~30 minute intervals and read a mere 26 bytes per drive.
 For info, I've got 3 separate storage pools. rpool is a single mirror vdev and contains the proxmox install. Both drives are SSD's and I don't care about the activity here so they aren't included in the dstat output below.
 I've then got tank1 which is a single mirror vdev, made up of sdi and sdj. I've then got tank2 which is a single raidz2 vdev and contains sde, sdf, sdg, sdh, sdk, and sdl.
 Does anyone know what might be causing the regular access? and more importantly how to prevent it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So standard wisdom is to run a CMA up one side of your rack and data and networking up and down the other side of the rack. It is known. This is the way. So uh, obviously if you're pulling your servers out twice a month for quick hardware swaps, upgrades, tweaks, and cleaning, like I do, you'll be using cable management arms to make sure your cables don't get splinched in the slide. Pretty basic stuff here. Now the real question. If you mount, say, all your power cables on the hinge side, and your data cables on the latch side, whichever side you mount your CMA on will have to have either power or data cables run across the rear of the rack to the CMA opening around back. What do you do about that awkward run of power or data across the rear of the rack over to the CMA ? Seems quite ugly to just have a bundle of cables all the way across. What's the correct or intended way to manage that awkward run from side to side?

 ​
 Like the title says. I don't care about noise or speed, the files I'll be backing up are usually not too big. As long as the thing is cheap and has a low chance of randomly bricking on me I'm okay with it.
 ​
 I've heard that the seagate barracuda or wd blue are good choices for what I'm looking for, but I'd rather hear it from people whom, like myself, also had their del key removed from their keyboards.
 ​
 I'm also thinking of getting an Orico enclosure, what do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my quest to further reduce the power bill for my home lab I'm considering the merits of configuring my HDDs to spin down after a while.
 I've listed what I think are the pros and cons below, but I'm interested to hear others views on the subject.
 Pros
  
Cost saving in electricity. Potentially several W per drive, which adds up when you've got 10+ of the things.
 Slightly reduced noise when drives aren't spinning (not an issue for me)
  
Cons
  
Potential for reduced life span of drives = increased cost in replacing drives (need replacing more often)
 Increased latency when accessing files when drives have spun down (not an issue for me)
  
Have I missed anything and how much should I really be concerned with reducing the life span by spinning the drives down?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am fairly new to the homelabe community. 
 Thanks to you guys and your effort I was able to implement a small homeserver on a Raspberry Pi 4 running a VPN server, Jellyfin and SMB/CIF shares. Also I am proud of my backup strategy which is a bash script with rsync mirroring all my data on my shares to a Windows drive on my desktop, which I shared on my network.
 So thank you all!
 ​
 But now I want to go further and tinker around with Proxmox. I might also have a use case for a friend of mine:
 He started a small engineering firm, so naturally he's a little tighter on cash.
 We are a small team (yes, I also work there part-time in addition to my main job and support him in setting up), but sometimes have quite computationally intensive workloads.
 Currently we have one workstation, which is well equipped in terms of compute power, but as soon as someone works on it, the others have to wait. The hardware would be sufficient to run our workloads in parallel. Also working from remote is not possible due to that.
 Do you guys think it would be a good idea to set up Proxmox on this PC and create several VMs for each Application we have?
 We are also using AutoCAD. Is it possible to work from remote on the VM without having it lag all the time?
 Do you guys have some nice resources to get started with Proxmox?
 I already ordered an old and cheap Thinclient to tinker around ;) 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I just installed OwnCast (install is a bit strong, I had Linode Marketplace do it) on Linode. 
 On my first go, I didn't use the Marketplace. I used Ubuntu on a Shared Nanoode 1 GB plan with Docker. When I ran my stream test, the CPU was at 100%. I didn't think that was good, so I deleted that and noticed I could use MarketPlace to install Owncast's version. 
 This time I went with the SHared Linode 2 GB. It has 1 CPU like the Nanode but has twice the ram. This time the CPU was at 60%.
 My question is, what would be the "most" adequate plan? I'd love to do this for $5/mo, but not if it's going to push the node too much. Also, would the 1cpu/2gig be enough?
 Thanks for any insights!!

I am planning on having following services to start the journey: - Jellyfin: movies/shows and maybe also music streaming to home and outside - arr stack + torrent client: to automate downloads - Some cloud storage to maybe backup pictures from phone
 Now from what I read on this sub it would be better to have the OS installed on a separate SSD instead of the SD card. Do you have any suggestions of an SSD that would be suitable? 
 Same questions for an external HDD. I'm thinking that 8tb would be more than enough at this time.
 I am looking for the lower priced SSD and HDD..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have my server set to auto-on after power failure and the UPS depletes. But the last time that happened, I learned the hard way that my USB drive enclosure doesn't auto-on. When the server spun up, Plex didn't see about half my library and removed everything, which screwed up the whole .arr aparratus too and required significant time to rebuild those databases. 
 So, I went looking for an enclosure that will auto-power-on like my computer after failure, but I can't seem to find one. Is there a reason why not? Some electrical code thing? I could home-brew a PC case and jumper the PSU but I'd much rather have a quality purpose-built enclosure -- and something that can handle like eight drives without all the space needed for the motherboard and the rest. Even better if it took mini-SAS cables from my HBA card. Thoughts? Appreciate any help.

I want it to be connected via Ethernet, but the problem is the smart panel in my house is in the laundry room and I’m not sure how much that would impact the NAS. My thought was to keep it in the lower cabinets in the room. The room is a decent size (about 10ft x 8ft), has a large fan, and I haven’t noticed much of a difference in temperature when doing laundry. Would that be a terrible idea? I would prefer to keep it in the office, but the Ethernet wiring is only in the laundry room and I’m not sure how difficult/expensive it would be to move it to the office since it’s on the opposite side of the house (home is about 3300sq ft).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've recently installed Apache Guacamole through Cloudron in a Proxmox VM running Ubuntu server. I'm trying to set up SSH and VNC connections to my VMs and a Raspberry Pi so I can manage my servers remotely, but I've been stuck on VNC connectivity for the last few days. I can SSH into every device fine, but VNC never works no matter what I've tried.
 Some things I've noticed when troubleshooting is that the VNC servers are extremely inconsistent when it comes to connectivity. From my desktop running EndeavourOS, I can connect to both my Raspberry Pi and a Proxmox Debian VM, but only the Pi can be interacted with as the Debian VM connects, but has no display on any VNC client software I've tried.
 However, when it comes to Guacamole, I can't connect to either of them whatsoever. I've seen dozens of forum posts and Reddit posts telling me to create vncpasswds and how to configure that in the settings, but nothing works.
 Would any of you have any insight as to why my set up isn't working as intended? Would something like RPort be a better alternative?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to setup various IP-whitelist middlewares with Traefik. One thing that i would like to do is allow connections to certain services only through a VPN connection. I run the Wireguard server using wg-easy and the container is also connected to the traefik-proxy network. My subnets look like this:
  
VPN: 172.20.0.0/24
 Traefik-Proxy: 172.16.1.0/24
 docker0: 172.16.0.0/24
  
Now i would like to setup my VPN whitelist like this:  http: middlewares: ipwhitelist-vpn: ipWhiteList: sourceRange: - "172.20.0.0/24"  When i am connected to my VPN and access a service, i get a 403 forbidden, with the Traefik access log looking this: {"ClientAddr":"172.16.1.1:36904", "DownstreamStatus":403, ...}
 Looking at the routing table of the container, this does indeed make sense:
  default via 172.16.1.1 dev eth0 172.16.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.16.1.19 172.20.0.0/24 dev wg0 proto kernel scope link src 172.20.0.1 
 So traffic gets routed through eth0 (the traefik network) by default, which results in the Traefik proxy seeing it's own gateway ip address as the source. However, i would like the incoming source ip address to be my VPN gateway (172.20.0.1). Is there a way to accomplish this? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I'm running a private discord server. I've created different channels such as "plex-notifications", "automation-notifications", "homelab-status", etc. I have webhooks set up in Discord connected with different services like Tautulli, *arr's, Uptime Kuma, and many others. Unfortunately, not everything supports webhooks so there's a service here and there that I can't set up with Discord. Despite that, this set up has worked relatively well for me over the last year ish.
 However, as a homelabber, I feel compelled to try new things out and mess with things that aren't necessarily broken. So I want to see what systems you guys have put in place to send you notifications about things going on in your network. Interested in things like how quickly you receive notifications from the time of an event, how many services have you come across that don't incorporate into your notification system, and things of that nature.
 Looking forward to hear what you all are doing. Thanks!

I was using a simple windows install with samba shares before and ideally I would want that + something like either Dropbox sync or more like just reliable incremental file backups over the net(I was looking at nextcloud/owncloud for that), it doesn't have to be windows so I was also looking at something like trueNas or open media vault. I'd like to know what software or system would suit my needs best, or any suggestions or opinions since I never used any of those before. Thanks. Ps: I'd also like to know if it's possible/easy to scale or migrate those systems but that's not something I need right now, just looking for some info.

 It's going to be a long and hard journey and it make takes years for me to get a v1.0 release but I am determined. 
 Server: https://github.com/Ortygia/Deaftone Written in Rust using SeaORM. And SQLx in the scanner
 Client: https://github.com/Ortygia/Orpheus Written in JS. Using Vue+Tailwind and Tauri for desktop and eventually mobile
 ​
 I am looking to get features for both the server and the client from people. Features that would make you switch to it if and when it eventually releases.
 ​
 I am currently having a big discussion in https://github.com/Ortygia/Deaftone/issues/7 about multi-user support and how it would be done.
 ​
 So I have a question would you rather have the same library as all users? Separate libraries each kinda like Plex/Jellyfin or a common library and a user-specific library. Where you can browse the common and user-specific libraries at the same time

 In my dreams i'd like a 2U 5700u/h with 2 pci express slots with adequate lanes, a boot device and maybe 4 ddr4 slots.
 I understand that i can go with a regular ryzen, but i'd prefer a low powered version.
 Has anyone already found something interesting or relatable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Been looking into selfhosting an own Git repository through Forgejo and would like to combine this with Drone for CI/CD.
 Would a single 12$ Droplet (2GB / 1CPU, 50GB SSD) suffice, or is it better to still split them up (into two 6$ Droplets of each 1GB RAM)?
 I'd not be worried if both go down at the same time instead of either one, as both services would be tightly integrated after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the the UniFi Controller (linuxserver/unifi-controller) running in a Docker container on one VM connected to a one (management) VLAN and NPM running in a Docker container on another VM connected to a another (dmz) VLAN.
 I can reach the UniFi UI just fine from a browser on the dmz VLAN when using the IP address (https://192.168.10.111:8443), but not through the reverse proxy.
 I can ping the UniFi IP from the NPM Docker host and it seems I can even curl the UniFi UI from within the NPM Docker container (although it is complaining about the certificate).
 [root@docker-npm:/app]# curl https://192.168.10.111:8443 curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above. 
 This is the NPM configuration I have been using for the UniFi UI. Anyone know what I might be missing here?

 Edit: I forgot to mentioned that I am proxying a whole bunch of other services the same way. The difference is that they are on the same VLAN as the NPM, but I do not see how that is an issue as the UniFi application is clearly reachable from the VLAN NPM is on.
 SOLVED: Never mind! I forgot to add it (unifi.at.home) as a Host Override Alias for the NPM host IP. (This is what makes the internal domain name resolution work).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit,
 so I am currently considering buying an old used PC to then self-host Nextcloud on it. But as this is the first time I ever self hosted something I have a few questions:
 ​
  
How good (RAM, CPU) does a PC need to be to host just Nextcloud within let's say Fedora Linux?
  How good should the PC be if I one day decide to also host a small Minecraft Server (just for me and friends so nothing big) on it
 How are the energy costs resulting from running a Computer all day compared to just getting a subscription from some server provider?
 If the hard drive (ssd or hdd) one day breaks is it than possible for a noob like me to recover the data? How would I ensure that I definitely do not lose any data without buying a second hard drive just to copy all the content?
 How long can I expect a old Computer to work as a server?
 What do you think are the main advantages (except from data ownership) from self-hosting instead of buying a subscription?
  
​
 Please feel free to answer any of the questions if you know answers to only some of them. Also feel free to just send a link without context if some of the questions have been asked here before and then angrily down vote the post :) .
 Thank you for your help and time

 1. Nextcloud has an All-in-One docker image
  
Use Nextcloud official docker images(s)
 Could I know which might be the better one for long term running as I used Nextcloud in home for years, I might have lot of files to import after I settle the new server.
 Hope to hear others experience with Nextcloud with docker. 
  
Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi data hoarders,
 (if this is not the right place for this kind of question, please kindly let me know)
 I'm looking for a reliable drive (and enclosure) for quiet media usage. It will be mostly used to hold and serve media, and will hold files from 1GB up to 90GB, for streaming (Plex or NFS), connected to a laptop. Essentially a poor man's NAS. Noise is a concern, from the drive itself or from enclosure fan, as this drive would be in a living room. 5400RPM would be enough. Not frequently written to either. Any suggestions considering the use case? 
 FYI, I did some research on this, but I think it's time to ask the experts. I know about SMR vs CMR, and that Helium-filled drives are supposedly from silent. Thought of perhaps buying a decent CMR drive, and put it in a fan-less 3'rd party enclosure, but I'm having a hard time choosing the hardware. There's too many options around and it's tricky to get full specs on everything, not to mention a lot of contradicting information, gets confusing fast.
 Thanks in advance!

 Right now I am trying to set up SSL and manage the certificates on:
  
iLO4
 OPNsense
 Proxmox
 AdGuard
 Grafana
 Uptime Kuma
 TL-SG108E
 TL-EAP225
  
I’d use Cloudflare Tunnel only if it didn’t expose/route the pages to the outside world (I’d rather the pages only load if the requests are from my VLANs, instead of having to setup email pin-code etc.). That way I could put SSL on anything easily with Cloudflare acting as a reverse proxy 
 What do y’all use to achieve this in your own homelabs?

 I currently have several Windows Server VMs for AD, Exchange, SharePoint and a few other services and I have a Windows Server 2022 Datacenter license so I was considering using that as my hypervisor since it allows me to automatically license all Windows VMs, but I was wondering if that’s a viable option or if I’m better off sticking with ESXi 6.5 or maybe moving to a different hypervisor. 
 To be honest the only advantage of using WS as a hypervisor is the unlimited licensed VMs but if the resources overhead is too high then I guess getting additional licenses for my VMs would be the best option.
 Any thoughts on that?

 I can install and browser around, but things are not configured correctly and I an error saying I'm serving untrusted URLs over HTTPs.
 I currently use lets encrypt to do TLS termination at the nginx layer.
 edit: Sorry about formatting. Classic Reddit is terrible for MD formatting and I'm in the car.

 From what I can tell looking at the config.php, I don't even think these env variables are doing anything. The whole setup is pretty confusing IMO. 
 Would anyone know how to setup these hops? I only am interested in using NGINX and ideally I want to just proxy requests through NGINX I already have running.

I want to eventually scale up from a single node cluster, to a dedicated media server, transcoding/download server, as well as a separate NAS with RAID to store all the files.
 On a very high level I'm wondering what kind of hardware would be ideal for a home media server, without going too crazy about it. I don't want to spend too much, but am willing to put down an appropriate amount, to optimize the machines for their purpose.
 My current server is fairly straightforward, a Ryzen 7 3700X, with 32GB RAM and a RX560 for HEVC decoding/H.264 encoding. It's where everything runs at the moment, but I'm wondering if this setup would be more suitable for transcodi…]]></summary>

 1 - 2014 MacBook Pro 16Gb (running Home Assistant, Portainer, and K3S Master node cluster) 2 - Raspberry Pi 4 4gb ram(running as 2 working nodes for K3S cluster) 1 - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (running Octopi for a 3D printer) 1 - lenovo thinkcentre m700 intel i5-6500t 24gb ram (running Proxmox 7.3: Windows 11 VM only) with 128gb SSD and 1tb NVME for VM storage
 Running Home Assistant and Portainer on the MacBook Pro has been great and a perfect server to run the few docker services. 
 I’ve been struggling with Kubernetes and feel like I’m not using is to it’s potential so the VM on the MacBook and the two RPis running the working nodes is a waste of hardware. Any ideas heree? Maybe I’ll need to dedicate them to a bare metal service of some sort.
 RPi Zero 2 W is perfect for my 3d printer. 
 And now I have a Proxmox server running only Windows 11 but has so much more potential. 
 I feel like I have the necessary hardware to run all my services and more but is not much tho. How would you change it and how can I push my hardware to the limits?

 After a few hours of testing, troubleshooting and even disassembling it I'm sure it's the mainboard and not the SSDs, RAM or any other "lose" component. 
 This was my first "real" server, before I was hosting on my NAS and since I'm hosting a lot of personal stuff it really hurts atm ... 
 I bought this NUC used and I guess I had bad luck, after disassembling it I found lots of proof that someone before me did something to it (scratches, burnt soldering, etc.). 
 Before just looking for a replacement NUC I'm curious what kind of hardware you guys would recommend. Since the SSDs (1x M.2 and 1x 2,5") and the RAM (DDR4 SODIMM) are fine I of course want to reuse them in the new system.
 Price should be around 300€ if possible, the hardware should be available in EU (quick delivery time) and I'd prefer a Intel CPU with Quick Sync for Plex hardware acceleration (not a must-have tho),
 Any idea is appreciated, thanks for your help.

 Please review what I'm proposing below and see if anyone has recommendations/guidance, sees any pitfalls, or if this is just a bad idea due to over complexity. 
 Goals
 Multi node HA cluster. I want to be able to actually do things with my machines (move them, offline something, etc.) without everything going hard down.
 Kubernetes! Gotta learn at some point..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and a friend are heavily interested in establishing an ASN, and pretty much owning are own part of the internet. Purely for the use of us self hosting applications, such as mail, but also to get the experience, and work with these large enterprises and backbones. We first want to have a solid plan before we invest into anything, which we mostly have, however before we pay the $500 some dollars to establish our ASN, we obviously want to have a IPv4 block first. Would anyone know a broker or dealer that could get us a IPv4 block, doesn’t even have to be a big block, we are shooting for a /25, but could also settle with anything lower then that as well, being such that someone could subnet a small block from a bigger block they own to us. I’ve been trying to do this for 4 years now, but am finally now ready to invest my full time and energy into this. Recently came a cross this article, which is pretty similar to what we are wanting to accomplish https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2017/11/creating-autonomous-system-for-fun-and.html

Does anyone have any idea how DDR5's ECC compares against true ECC memory?

 Sorry for the newbie question but I bought a mini PC to act as a home server at my house. The main use would be to deploy some docker containers that would be accessible from outside...It came with a Windows 11.
 After searching this subreddit, everyone recommended installing Proxmox.
 Can you kindly explain what is the benefit of Proxmox? especially vs ESXI or Windows + VMware workstation?
 Last "noobie" question: Can I run a wireless adapter under linux? since it is very hard to connect the PC via cable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 i would like to use a domain in my home network to access all my different services on different ports.
 I have running proxmox with different containers and vms.
 Is it possible to setup an reverse proxy to route everything over a domain instead of the ips/hostnames? Also i wanna remap every services webinterface to port 80 or 443 with the reverse proxy.
 For example:
 pihole.mydomain.com instead of http://192.168.178.67/admin
 or
 proxmox.mydomain.com instead of https://192.168.178.2:8006
 Also everything should automatically route over https.
 This plan is only for my local home network. Nothing should be exposed.
 I read about nginx but i dont know how to setup especially with pihole running. Do you guys know any good video on youtube or a good tutorial on any blog?

I'm trying to upload large files, such as videos, to my PhotoPrism instance over the reverse proxy but I'm unable to upload anything over 100MB. I've done somewhat extensive research and found that Cloudflare limits uploads to 100MB, so I tried setting my PhotoPrism subdomain to DNS only (gray cloud) and still cannot upload large files to my server. I've also tried modifying my php.ini file to allow larger uploads and still see no change. I've also tried adding advanced parameters inside NPM but when I do that the reverse proxy fails to resolve.
 ​
 Would someone be able to help me diagnose why these uploads fail over reverse proxy but work very quickly when I connect to my server locally? It would really help with uploading my pictures and videos from my phone when I'm away from the house. Thanks!

 I understand the last digits are corruption errors, where there is a discrepancy between what is written and read for that block.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a webserver on my home network, along with a VPN server (OpenVPN Access Server). The VPN server uses post 443 over TCP, and so does my webserver. So I tried to create a stream from that server to the domain for the VPN, and while the server's admin interface shows up, I can't connect to it.

 I'd prefer something that has a good GUI on the web or an iOS app. I don't really require anything more than that. Remote access would be a plus, but it's not required since I can use TeamViewer to my PC and then RDP to the rest if needed.

 A fair bit of search engine work hasn't been fruitful, so I'm hoping that someone in this community might know if it or something similar still exists for self hosting.
 I appreciate the help.

 I guess I'll have to use something else than ytdl-material.
 Can someone point me to the right direction ?

 What would be a good option for password-protected video sharing? Ideally I'd want something that can be played smoothly in a browser, at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a Patriot Viper VPN110 2TB PCIE3 NVME SSD and am currently writing some heavy workloads from a video cutting software on it (I am cutting my movie collection). 
 Now the problem: When I do the first 2 or 3 runs (~180GB each), the ssd works fine at >1GBps write speed (uncompressed avi video). after that the speed stays only a couple seconds at >1GBps and then drops down to ~150MBps which lets the entire process take much longer (20 instead of 3 minutes).
 I know the SSD first fills the cache, but sometimes it writes 80GB quick before cutting down to 150MBps.
 Here is a benchmark from a review site (for the 1TB disk), even in the real-world-performance test the disk barely went under 500MBps write speed.
 I tought about thermal throttling but after addding a server fan which keeps the ssd below 35 degree C under full load I dont think thats the problem.
 Something interesting too is that even after waiting 2 hours, the ssd wont let me write a "long" time at >1GBps again, only when I shut down the computer.
 Can someone explain this weird behaviour?

 I am searching for a bookmark tool which can be selfhosted (bacause of privacy concerns) an be used by multiple team members. I tried fluccus already, but we ran into sync issues which wiped the changes which were done by one team member earlier. 
 We established a workaround for this, that we set the agent to read-only and enable read-write to the database only when we do actual changes, but maybe someone has a better solution for this. 
 Also tried xbrowsersync which didn't work either.
 Thanks for helping and happy new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been lurking here a while but since I am relatively new at this stuff please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask. I am just starting my journey creating a local network. I have set up Plex and pi-hole on Dockers in my server running OMV (old laptop), and a very close friend gave me a license for Mullvad. It would be awesome to add this vpn to my whole network instead of one device, specially if I can turn it on and off easily. Is this even possible? What I have found online so far ranges from people saying it is not possible to people saying it is and I should use Wireguard on a rPie, but in my case it feels like using docker is the best way to go. I already route everything in my network to the pi-hole in the server through my router... Would it work to just route pi-hole to the VPN or send everything to Mullvad in my router config and then send mullvad to the pi-hole? If this is too confusing please lemme know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello - I am a video editor with about 80tb of data. Originals are on two qnap four bay DAS, working files are on a 50tb OWC thunderbolt, and everything gets backed up to a 8 bay 70tb qnap (with a 4 bay qnap as overflow) . I need off site but money is an issue. It’s taken me a lifetime to acquire the drives and enclosures I have. I was considering buying 5 WD 20tb mybooks , and storing them at my parents a few miles away. But I know u won’t like that so I wanted to hear this subs better ideas. That would cost me 1500-2000 which is kinda absolute max. I’ve also considered idrive for cloud instead , but I’m not sure that will be economical . Especially over long term. I originally wanted another server at my parents house that I could back up to over the internet. But I don’t think It makes sense for me to spend that kind of money. I have very basic knowledge of this stuff based on just using my qnap. I don’t know anything about advanced IT. I am using a Mac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I tried to search for this topic but couldn't find anything that matched my setup.
 I have a VMware ESXi server running both internal and external servers. External servers are isolated on a single VLAN that has only access to internet, so they are isolated from the rest of the internal network.
 Now I want to isolate each server from the others on this "external" VLAN, so that each of the webservers (for example) can only talk to the reverse proxy server, but not with each other.
 What would be the best, easiest (and cheapest) way to accomplish this?
 I would like to...
  
avoid using a local firewall on each server (Ubuntu), unless it can be centrally managed somehow.
 avoid using multiple VLANs in order to keep network traffic on the host. So traffic doesn't have to go from the router, to the reverse proxy, back to the router and then to the VM.
  
How do/would you do it, to keep public facing servers safe from each other?

 - There are not many options for server cases on Brazil
 - Not everyone ships to Brazil. When they do, it's 5x the case's price

 So I'm inclined to fabricate one (not me, someone specialized). Where can I buy the schematics for an 4u case? Apparently Protocase have a design service, is there other options which I'm not aware of? Thanks in advance.

 I'm doing something similar but didn't use the clever pseudo-random algorithm used by the other user vanceza. I just formatted ExFAT and dumped the same set of randomly generated data stored as txt files to each drive.
 The intent is to check if data is lost while SSD remains unpowered over 1,2,3,4 years time both on a well worn and fresh SSD.
 Test disks are four 128GB 2.5" SATA SSD's. Some cheap Chinese Leven SSD (JS600). I grabbed a five pack for like $60. Disassembling the last non-test disk SSD revealed some Leven branded NAND flash (JA28A2TB00 - 2148).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least here in germany it feels like 99% of self-hosted services are running on hardware/servers from Hetzner or Netcup. While I am actually satisfied with both of them, I am wondering if there are some other players with good hardware for a good price. I am not unhappy or disappointed in any way. Just trying to get an overview.
 I tried Contabo but wasn't happy. Feels like their higher tiers are somewhat okay, but once the server is running to many instances your VPS is slowing down more and more.
 I am really just looking for older and established companies that will most likely not stop their business next week due to miscalculation or other problems. So non of those reseller-reseller-resellers^^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would like to achieve the following:
  
Various servers I have to send data at regular intervals to a central server/website (cloud hosted or hosted by me). I don't want the reverse to happen (server to contact the various hosts, and having to open ports)
 Send "heartbeat" data ("I am alive") and the central server alerting if something is down (no "alive" message detected after x minutes)
 Send very basic data like CPU usage over the last minute, 5 minutes, RAM, storage. Maybe 5 or 10 data metrics
  
I need the "agent" to be very lightweight, as some of those servers are low spec (like 1GB of RAM, or even 512MB).
 I have tried to install NetData but it brought several servers to their knees during the install. I have tried Prometheus, which seems fine but overkill for the task (and also it seems that the server is contacting the hosts).
 I could also do my own version (running a Python script every few minutes to post data to a website), or maybe have Python use MQTT to send messages to a MQTT server, but I would prefer to have an already built solution.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've been searching for a day or two for an older Intel BIOS for my DQ77KB motherboard. I know Intel pulled everything from their site years ago and an effort was made to grab everything available as fast as possible. 
 Unfortunately, the massive 342GB archive has my bios, but version 0061 which is extremely buggy (broken LAN, voltage, temp monitoring). Intel even went as far as removing the forum sections on their community page so I can't even find workarounds to these issues.
 So with this in mind, I'm wondering if someone here might have Intel DQ77KB BIOS v0058? The filename would be KB0058.BIO and the Intel download mirror number would have been 25621. 
 For now I'm going to slap another NIC in the machine, but really hoping to go back to the last stable BIOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start by saying I have had no experience with any of this sort of thing prior to this project, so please explain like I'm 5 :)
 I'm trying to convert a whole bunch of 8mm tapes for my family. Half of them play on a Sony Handycam I have, which I'm using a firewire cable to transfer to my computer. Due to the format of the tapes, the other half will only play on an older camcorder, which just I ordered off of eBay. Problem is that the older model (Sony Handycam CCD-TRV37) has no micro USB port to use firewire. From what I understand, the best way to convert these tapes is with the use of an audio/video capture card (essentially just composite to usb). I know that using this method will lead to some quality loss of the footage, but if it's the only way then it's better than nothing.
 These capture card cable thingies range from like 10 to 100 dollars online. Has anyone used this method to convert old tapes? Does it matter which one I buy, or can I just get a cheaper one? Do you have any recommendations for what software is best for this process? 
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started out self hosting on a little NUC (4-core, 32 GB RAM, SSD+HD+USB HD) running Ubuntu in my closet, and have now grown to hosting quite a few apps on it, some of which are "mission critical". Also, the prospect of spending a day reconfiguring everything if the machine goes down is quite scary. I'm running docker for apps that are come dockerized, but I haven't invested in learning to dockerize individual apps on my own to make them easier to backup and restore.
 Bottom line, I'm looking to make the hardware more fault tolerant (RAID array?) and the software easier to restore (Proxmox with VMs and Docker containers?). Right now, I'm worried about even upgrading Ubuntu, which has given me headaches before.
 I'm currently running:
  
zoneminder (want to move to frigate) (apt install)
 homeassistant (pip install)
 paperless-ngx (docker)
 jellyfin (docker)
 nextcloud (docker)
 offlineimap + notmuch + netviel (offline searchable IMAP archive) (manual install)
 kopia (manual install)
  
Option #1: More hardware + Proxmox - Upgrade machine to full tower supporting RAID (also requires upgrading my UPS and maybe installing an exhaust fan in my closet)
 Option #2: Same hardware + Migrate to Proxmox (temporarily moving all services to somewhere else)
 Option #3: Move less critical services (homeassistant, etc.) to raspberry pi, etc to reduce monolith risk
 Option #4: Simpler disaster recovery (is there some way to easily image the entire machine regularly?)
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick question here, I''ve noticed my QNAP NAS does constant HD access. It cannot enter sleep/suspend because of the amount of background programs running on newer QTS. Investigating Synology seems similar, sleep functions might work, but tons of constant HD Access ticks, no matter what. 
 I am not a very complex user, I just use it as a file server. I do love the form factor and easy functionality of these NAS' but I can't stand the constant noise it makes. All the "quiet nas" reviews and videos focus on quietest hard drives and the most sound proof NAS case/enclosures. It seems like almost no one is focusing on the operating system these run on and how much noise is created when you aren't accessing the NAS at all ! 
 My question is: Is there any NAS that doesn't run a ridiculous amount of background tasks, asustor or terramaster etc ? anyone have experience with these operating systems ? As hilarious as it may sound, I would like the drives to operate in the way windows operates, in the sense that, if you aren't accessing the drives, they don't make a single sound. Why can't any NAS be like this ?

 Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.
 Fairly new to Ubuntu, but as an IT guy, I've had enough exposure to it to be comfortable working with it, and I'd like to think I can pick it up pretty quickly, so feel free to nerd out on me!
 I'm creating myself a home media server, I've got a little NUC (i5, 16gb RAM, 256 SSD) which I'd like to make my usenet box, using Ubuntu, and ultimately Docker to get it going, my plex server is going to run on a different box too, but that's currently setup anyways and working fine, I just want to add a bunch of automation to it
 I've followed this guide - Docker Media Server Ubuntu 22.04 with 23 Awesome Apps | SHB (smarthomebeginner.com) - Which is amazing, but, I can't see my NAS (i have added NFS mount points and can upload into it from Ubuntu directly, just SABNZD doesn't see it at all, I did a few permission changes, but nothing changed.
 I've found this link, is this going to allow me to see my NAS from the Containers in Docker? 
 NFS Docker Volumes: How to Create and Use | phoenixNAP KB 
 I'm going to start again, I'd like to stick to Ubuntu purely for the benefit of more exposure to another OS. I can't find any guides on setting up with a NAS as Storage, but I imagine it's just my lack of understanding of the OS and Docker for how it works rather than it not being possible
 TIA

 I would also like to be able to tune in live on my phone using something like tinyCam Monitor

 Could a Pi Zero power an IR USB webcam? Could I record straight to my server and still tune in to view live? Which software would you recommend?

 I'm in the midst of building out my 12U racked home network and upgrading to Ubiquiti network / protect and thinking about how to tweak my home server.
 The home server is a Plex box that is essentially 2 x 12TB drives coupled to a HP EliteDesk 800 G2 with a i5 6600T Quad Core 3.5 GHz and 16GB of RAM. It's solid and super low power but I've already lost one of these drives (warranty ftw!) which is really annoying to recover from. 
 I'm in the market for a 1U or 2U option but hoping to find something with options for several drives, RAID and something that isn't crazy high power / loud or can be configured to run as such. I've been looking at the Dell R720 and equivalent HP but curious what other folks are using. I'd prefer not to use a NAS or Synology, etc as I like to get in there and tinker (for better or worse).
 Any thoughts/tips/ideas or posts folks can point me at?

 let me explain my setup a bit, i currently have a linux vm running some services on my local nas in my house and i want to publish those services to the internet so anyone can use them.
 I thought it would be cool (and safe!) to just use a cheapo vps with a tailscale tunnel to my vm and use that vps as a reverse proxy so everybody can reach the public vps, and then only the vps uses tailscale to my local vm entering my local network.
 is this possible? i know for shure that i am missing some steps here but i want to learn.
 is this safer than some other possibilities? i dont want to host my services online cause i'll need to rent a pretty beefy vps for that and i already have the hardware which is capable of running those things in home.
 dont tell me to use a dmz cause i dont have control over router (not actually "my" house...) and neither have a public ip (isp doing natting shit).
 There's a way i can accomplish what i want? thanks!

 For the longest while I just used linux for everything and I'd used rsync to backup all my data (photos, code, projects, configurations, etc.) to a local NAS device. This was simple and easy as I just had the one machine and rsync was simple.
 In recent years I now have a couple of linux machines and a couple windows machines at home that I'd like to keep synced/backed up. I see there are some solutions to using rsync on windows but I thought I'd see if there is some more robust cross-platform solution, or if not more robust, more tailored to this scenario.
 My requires are essentially:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon r/selfhosted,
 I had a small non profit Healthcare clinic that is looking for either a self hosted (free) or low cost cloud employee shift scheduling software. Something similar to hotschedules.
 Mainly we are hoping to find one that has a phone companion app (Android and iPhone) with web access also available.
 The main concern is they have mostly open schedules and want employees to sign up for the open slots. (Ala picking up free shifts) however I am finding it really hard to find a self hosted or even cloud hosted that allows the employees to pick up shifts.
 Please let me know if you have any suggestions or recommendations!
 Thank you!

 Currently the process goes,
 Hold an auction for staff with the money going to charity (this is all done by emails).
 Anything not sold sits in a store room until we either hold another auction or get some tech recyclers to come and get it. 
 So I figured there must be an easier way, someone must have posted some open source site to be able to do something like these? 
 A lot of what I've seen so far doesn't seem great, has anyone got any recommendations?

 I just recently bought my first NAS (Asustor 6 Gen 2) and some seagate Ironwolfs (4TB HDDx4) with it.
 After setting everything up and the RAID 5 syncing drive, one reported bad sectors: https://imgur.com/v1jI2kx 
 I searched it up a little and as far I can tell, HDD drives have fault tolerances and as long as the bad sector count doesn't increase it is not a problem, but no definitive answer on what should I do.
 Is this enough for me to return the Drive to the vendor and request a new one? Should I?

 From what I've read online I could do something like this:
  
Use exFAT format on my HDDs so each OS can read-write on them natively, but this format type gets easily corrupted.
 Maybe use my Windows machine to set up the HDD as a network drive through SMB and just use NTFS. (use Windows machine as proxy to write/read from each OS)
  
I think that a NAS is overkill since I don't need the data to be always online. I just want to backup important data on the HDDs and forget about it, but would like to be able to access it from each machine that I own.
 ​
 Is there a better way to do this?

 ​
 The components:
 CPU: Intel 10100
 MOBO: Asus H510M-E
 Storage: Western Digital 4TB WD Red Plus 
 case: Fractal design node 304
 ram: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz
 ​
 My home server will mainly be used to host jellyfin, a VPN(to access my network remotely), a portfolio website, DNS, and to create a local file server.
 And Im wondering how to do it. 
 ​
 Im thinking about just downloading Debian and running jellyfin on it and my file server and creating VMs for the rest which will run on top of the os. 
 ​
 or 
 ​
 using a hypervisor like proxmox to create VMs for each purpose. I heard Quicksync will not work this way and I hear having a media server on a VM is just asking for trouble. 
 ​
 I hear docker could be an option but I don't have enough knowledge of docker and don't really understand it, maybe one of you could enlighten me. 
 ​
 Im currently at a loss at the moment on how I should set this server up to be effective and easy to back up. 
 ​
 I really want to be able to back up my saved media.

 The filesystem on my storage server got corrupted from a sudden power loss during boot caused by a hardware failure. I've never had to recover a RAID array using ReFS before, but I heard the process was relatively painless thanks to the "resilient" nature of the filesystem itself and the accompanying diagnostic utility ReFSUtil.
 Then I saw this error message.
 Seriously, what the fuck is this? Did MS actually release an update to a filesystem designed for maintaining data integrity which actually makes the associated data recovery and diagnostic tool incompatible!? 
 What the actual fuck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
 SimpleX Chat now supports disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users.
 To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients' agreement. Our logic here is the same as for irreversible deletion of sent messages (this feature was added in 4.3).
 What do you think about it?
 This version also added:
  
connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 "live" messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate.
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

I’ve started collecting from the start of 2020 and it felt so good to have everything available on my computer and other storage devices. Projects, YouTube videos, entertainment, software, games, arts, OC content and more and I mean MORE! That means MORE terabytes! I became obsessed of buying hard drives and storing data!

 I work with a big amount of files that I need to acces daily so I really don't want to use external drives for that matter. My 1TB drive is always full and 2TB just won't be enough in a long run (yes I want to use it for games too)
 I am keeping the m.2 purely for OS and some essentional programs so my only option is to replace the 2,5" drive.
 Are there any high capacity hdd for laptops or should I just cash out 500€+ for ssd?
 I know about the Seagate barracuda 2,5" but they aren't the most reliable and it may not even fit to my laptop due to it's height.
 Thanks for any suggestions :)

 I love notion. But I love self-hosting more. I'm going to need to switch soon to a self-hosting alternative and I can't find the perfect replacement. I love notion's databases, freedom of customizing properties and views. In summary, I'd really love a self-hosting project management tool that allows me to: Create a task database that allows me too see in a list, board and timeline views
 ​
 Does someone recommend me a good alternative? I've checked outline but it seems lacking a lot of these features, plus they over rely on google and slack... And I'm also planning on creating a rocket.chat server for a self-hosted slack alternative.

 To be clear, I'm not looking for something like Stash. I'm looking to automatically label/tag and sort nudes.

 My goal is to have an offline copy of many wiki sites with images, I can do this with wget but it takes ages and I'm thinking there has to be an easier way. This comment thread seems to have some good information but I can't figure out where to start, is there a good beginners guide for stuff like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across docker-radarr-extended when I was looking into a way to download trailers alongside my movie files, and this image seems to be what I'm looking for. It uses custom scripts to configure Radarr, as well as provides one that downloads the trailers, so I'm curious to know if I can just plug-and-play replace my current Radarr container with this image.
 At the moment I'm using the Radarr image from LinuxServer, which this is based off of, and have a custom configuration for the way Radarr should name and organize movies, so I would be disabling the enableAutoConfig which will hopefully avoid it from overriding my configuration.
 Besides that, I have volumes set-up in K3s for Radarr, and already a large collection of movies that its tracking as well as indexers from Prowlarr and download clients. I just want to make sure that this image won't change any of that setup, which I don't expect it to, since it should just be the same LinuxServer image with additional scripts, but was wondering if anyone has had the situation where they migrated from Radarr to this extended image.
 Thanks in advance for any input!

I was not able to find a solution to combine them all together, so I have given up on that option. Joplin will stay as a read-later solution. Dashy, which I have chosen as a locally hosted dashboard will host a few links from Papaly's quick access bar that I access multiple times a day. There is still the choice for an app that will host the bulk of links currently residing in Papaly pages, Raindrop, and Google bookmarks.
 I have searched through Selfhosed listings, searched the web for solutions, and cut the choice down to three options: 
  
Linkding, 
 Linkace,
 Servas. 
  
I cannot avoid running each one of them for a few days and seeing the solution for myself. That was the way I have found that I do not like Wallabag, while from reading about it it seemed like a perfect solution. But, when one runs a solution for a few days one can miss some options or characteristics.
 So, before I start my test run, I want to hear from those of you who have chosen not to use one of those three, what made you choose to avoid them, and I want to hear from those of you who are using one of those three, what made you choose them and do you have any regrets you found about later while using it.
 Thank you

 As we know, older Apple devices after the end of support quickly lose functionality. I have one of these devices - "iPad Mini 1", which despite of it's advanced age was still ok. I thought it would make a great dashboard for my mini server rack. This is where the adventure begins.
 Problems
  
Safari completely refuses to navigate to pages with a port specified, which means that the dashboard must be available on standard ports 80/443. We will use nginx in front.
 iOS 9 contains legacy root certificates, which, fortunately, can be easily installed. Because my home services are running on LE-certificates, this option came in handy.

 For those who don't know about Budibase, it's an open-source low-code platform (GUI) that saves you time and effort building internal tools.
 To kickstart 2023, we have a new release that will speed up the dev process when building internal tools:
 New side panel (total CRUD in 1 screen)
 You can now view records in a side panel. What's also super cool is you can continue to navigate records whilst the side panel is active. This reduces the number of screens you have to use and creates a smooth and faster experience for end-users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy homelabbers! 
 I’m currently running a 3 node Proxmox cluster with a tiered Ceph storage pool backing my media library, which is advertised to the network via an SMB share running on a Windows Server VM. I run Plex separately on an M1 Mac Mini and don’t plan to change that. 
 My current issue is that due to the limitations of how Ceph is implemented, I have 33% space efficiency. I’d like to migrate to something like ZFS/ReFS and drastically increase that efficiency, but I’m a little overwhelmed with all of the options.
 As I see it, there are 3 routes I can go from here to get more space out of my current storage, and make it much easier to add capacity in the future:
  
 Build my own dedicated NAS server running either my Windows Server install or migrating to TrueNAS (don’t really care which one, comfortable with both *Nix and Windows)
  Buy an off the shelf NAS
  Buy/Build a JBOD enclosure and pass it through to my Windows install.
  
I’ve been leaning towards number 3 because I don’t really want another entire bare metal system taking up space and power, and I don’t really want to pay the prices Synology/QNAP are asking for off the shelf NAS offerings with enough bays to hold my current drive collection and my planned increase in drives. I am aware that by migrating to a JBOD, I will lose the capability to migrate my NAS management VM between Proxmox nodes like I can right now, but given that media isn’t a critical service, I can live with that.
 Can someone help me understand if I’m leaning the right way, and if so, how all of the JBOD stuff works? I keep seeing conflicting information about if a JBOD passes through individual drives to the managing system, or if they are exposed as one single “drive” that the JBOD itself manages/pools together. I’m not super picky about which OS I need to use or which file system is “best”, I just want to get more out of my drives than I get right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I self-host a lot of services and I’ve never felt the need to purchase a UPS. But since I’ve invested a lot of money into hardware, now I’m having second thoughts. When googling UPSs, most I’ve found can only signal a safe shutdown to a single machine, and therein lies my conundrum. I don’t know how to go about solving this problem and it’s looking like it will cost a fortune to solve this problem. 
 This is what my home lab looks like, hardware wise (all of these machines are in a single small room):
 * 2 x NUC Ubuntu servers. These are the workhorses and my priority.
 * A Synology DS920. I invested a lot of money on this thing and would be devastating if a power outage would corrupt the drives.
 * Motorola MG8702 modem/router. Would be nice to keep internet in the event of an outage, but meh.
 * 1 x Gaming Windows PC. It was a $3k investment, but I turn it off when I’m not gaming. I’m not so worried.
 * 2 x Macbook Pros. These don’t need the UPS.
 * 2 x Ultrawide gaming monitors. These don’t need the UPS. 
 Do I have to get multiple UPS machines, 1 per machine, to safely shutdown all of that in an event of a power outage? Or is there a single UPS I can buy that can signal all of them? What are my options? What do you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Ubuntu server 22.04 as my server system, and I'm having trouble realizing full possible performance to my remote filesystem living on a VPS.
 I tried both sshfs and curlftps, and I'm only getting around 60-70 Mbit/s when transferring a file from the remote filesystem to my server. About 500 Mbit/s should be possible.
 These are my /etc/fstab mounts:
 sshfs#user@my.vps.com /mnt/vps fuse _netdev,Ciphers=aes256-ctr,cache=yes,kernel_cache,compression=yes,reconnect,ServerAliveCountMax=3,ServerAliveInterval=5,identityFile=/path/to/ssh_key,allow_other 0 0 curlftpfs#user:password@my.vps.com /mnt/vps_ftp fuse auto,user,uid=1000,allow_other,_netdev 0 0 
 as I said, both mounts only allow about 12.5% of performance. I did a copy with
 cp /mnt/vps/test.file ~/test.file and cp /mnt/vps_ftp/test.file ~/test.file 
 the results are identical. I also did a download of the same file with curl
 curl -u user:password -o ~/test.file https://my.vps.com/test.file 
 here I get the full performance of 500 Mbit/s
 Also, I "double" my performance when I copy 2 files in parallel by doing this in multiple terminals:
  cp /mnt/vps/test.file ~/test.file cp /mnt/vps/test2.file ~/test2.file 
 I tried several guides for boosting the performance of sshfs (switching cyphers tuning network parameters) to no avail. Also ftp performance equally bad which is not using any encryption
 Is there a setting that I'm missing why my remote shares are performing so badly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm looking for some input and feedback or ideas on how to best backup photos/videos from my mobile devices(a Android phone and iPad) and manage them.
 My current setup is that I use resilio sync to copy the files to my home server(a headless debian server) and this part works excellent. I really like resilio. Resilio dumps all the files into one folder and I then use a cli app(sortphotos) to organize the photos. I then use photoprism to view and review/delete crappy photos.
 My issue is: 
 When I delete bad photos within photoprism, the next time I use sortphotos to copy new images over, it will recopy the crappy photos as well. 
 Is my setup/workflow just not that good? I want to be able to keep most the images on the devices as well since it's faster/easier to show people the photos when I'm not at home. 
 Thanks!

I am a student home on winter break so I am going to need to configure my lab for remote access if I wish to use it while I am away for the spring semester. What is the best way to go about doing this securely? Should I use a VPN to do this or is SSH with passwords disabled sufficient? Or a VPN and SSH?
 If anyone has some resources or some general steps that I should take for setting up remote access it would be really helpful! Apologies if these are really basic questions, I am very new to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've searched online and this subreddit for guides, but either the discussion goes beyond my understanding, or out of the scope of what i'm trying to accomplish.
 Essentially, I have a couple of machines, one running TrueNAS, and one running Proxmox with a couple of VMs for ubuntu with docker/minecraft servers, etc.
 Each one has a local ip address, and in the case of the ubuntu vm running docker containers, ip address with ports.
 Basically, instead of typing 192.168.x.xxx or 192.168.x.xxx:xxxx to access my servers, I want to be able to type something like truenas.com to access my NAS, or homelab.com to access my ubuntu server, with the docker containers being accessed like filebrowser.homelab.com, or portainer.homelab.com, instead of using ports.
 I've seen reccomendations for Traefik or DNS servers like using pihole, but I'm not interested in using another adblocking service, since i already use adguard.
 I'm a bit of a novice to this stuff, so any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cannot seem to get a good take on this and just keep faltering. I have tried many takes from others but I don't see how adding PUID/PGID solves my problems when trying to add a container (Radarr).
 All the steps say these docker compose containers are so easy and just add 1000 for PUID and PGID and permissions problems will be solved.
 But I have two problems even when I do this
 Lets take my docker compose file for example:
 services: radarr: container_name: radarr image: 'linuxserver/radarr:latest' environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - UID=1000 - GID=1000 - TZ=America/New_York volumes: - '/home/USER/serverfiles/configs/radarr:/config' - '/mnt/data/media/movies:/movies' - '/mnt/data/torrents/movies:/downloads' ports: - '7878:7878' restart: unless-stopped 
 So once I do compose up it creates a config folder with an ownership and group ID of 10999. Or something in that realm in the 10,000s. So I have read up on sudo chowning folders and utilizing but then once I take control of the folder the program no longer is accessible.
 Also the program never has access to my external mnt or doesn't have permissions to access it.
 I am not the root user on the computer Ubuntu. I don't want to run the webservice as root. So trying to be protective I want to run it as my user. User 1000. But I don't know how to get the docker to be able to interact with my host machine in a good way it seems.
 I'm using Ubuntu and Docker Desktop
 What is weird is my NGINX / Jellyfin / AdGuard Home work 100% fine and I didn't even specify the PUID on those. I have that hosted and working correctly.
 Any help would be appreciated because I'm almost certain this is me just not understanding docker and permissions about them.

 Second I have this problem with running the docker version of both Searx and SearXNG. What should I do?
 And third it seems that I can't run it in docker in background so basically I need to keep both laptop and VPS running and it's useless of me keeping the search engine on. What do I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web Portal Lite V1.1 is now released, bringing an enhanced ui. Image and more below.
 What Is Web Portal Lite
 Web Portal Lite is a web dashboard to manage a page of links. It offers a minimal feature set to the feature rich Web Portal. Designed for users who just want to create a fancy looking links page and not worry about the advanced features. Unlike Web Portal which features a full ui editor, this "lite" version uses a basic yaml file for configuration.
 Why Another Dashboard App?
 Due to my eye condition, I wanted something that was easier to see. So I built one. I have made it customizable by using CSS variables and config options such as the link colors and size. It also has no need for JavaScript since everything is configured by a single yaml file, making it fast to load on slow devices.
 What's Changed
  
Style improvements
 Now arm64 compatible
 Ability to generate template config from CLI
  
Features
  
Built in Rust
 Access a grid of beautiful links to your web services
 Works without JavaScript, to provide a lightning fast experience
 Customise dashboard through a basic yaml file (no database needed)
 Wide range of link colors (or no color)
 Provide your own app icons for links
 Create groups of links
 Optionally secure the portal with user accounts
 Icon based theme
 Dark/Light mode
 Lightweight Docker image

 For what it's worth, I'll be starting out with 9 drives installed in a Define 7 and going from there, so there is certainly some vibration tolerance that I feel should be taken into consideration.
 The price on them is certainly right, but if they're not a good match for a server use-case then I'll just have to suck it up and hold off on an EasyStore/Elements to go on an equally-good sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Scientific Atlanta PC115-60. It’s a 2U rack mount power distribution unit with 8 switched and 4 unstitched outlets - all front facing; there’s nothing on the back side. It’s quite old but works well. Makes an initial hum when I flip its power switch, then the hum dies down. (Still audible but much more quiet.)
 Google has apparently never heard of it - No results.
 Anyone ever seen one of these and know anything about it? I’m not sure if it’s just a PDU or a PDU + surge protector or a PDU + power conditioner or…?
 I’d post pics but I can’t figure out how.

Six core ryzen 5 with 64gb ram
 open media vault 6 (debian 11)
 boot and os on SSD
 databases on SSD
 configs and ~/torrent/incomplete on SSD (3 SSD total)
 zraid array with my media, backups, and ~/torrents/complete
  
I have a pi4 that's always on for another task; I'm going to be setting up syncthing to mirror the backup dir in my zraid.
 Duplicati has crossed me for the last time. Thus ,I'm looking for other options. I started looking into this a while back but injury recovery came up. I understand that there are many options however I'd love to hear from there community.
 I'm very comfortable with CLI and would be comfortable executing recovery options that way. I run the servers at my mom's and sisters houses, so I already do maintenance for them that way via Tailscale.
 I'm looking for open-source or free options, and my concerns orbit around two points:
  
backing up container data: I'm looking at a way to fully automate the backup process of a) shutting down each app or app+database prior to backup, b) completing a backup, and c) restarting app(s).
 
backing up my system so that I if my boot/os SSD died I could flash another and off I go.
 
 Amy advice it opinions would be warmly recieved. Thank you.

I've figured out how to convert everything into a blu-ray friendly ISO and I'm burning it using ImgBurn, and all that seems to be working. But every time I test the disc in a player, about 10 minutes in (not always the exact time, but around there) there's about one second of crazy visual artifacts around the screen.
 It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/eJN8BN0.jpg
 I of course checked the original video file and it's not there, so it seems to be happening during the burning process. Is there some common thing that causes this, and a good way to avoid it? I tried burning at 2x instead of 4x speed and it's still showing up, which was the only idea I had.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairly new to Docker and the whole homelab/self-hosted world. I'm a backend developer (Django) and always preferred to have my dev environments hosted on Ubuntu VMs using VirtualBox. Been resisting Docker for almost 4 years now, but I think it's about time I started this venture.
 One of the common practices when spinning up a new environment is to have both the DB and Django in one docker-compose file, and a docker file for Django. I find this tedious in a homelab environment and would prefer to have one Postgres server for all the local apps I work on.
 When I tried this, I was faced with the issue of my apps not able to connect to the centrally hosted Postgres server. Further experimentation revealed to me that it's because my containers are hosted on different networks. Took me about 2 days to notice that, but I'm enjoying the unravelling of the homelab "mysteries" so far.
 My question is how do you go about configuring such an environment? Do you usually host a separate DB server for each app or do you centralize your DB server? If I were to go with the latter, and without adding the complexities of VLANs for now (isolating the DB server, firewalls, etc), what is my best option to allow traffic in/out on port 5432 for my main Postgres server? Is it host networking?
 I know to some this might seem 101, but some guidance would be highly appreciated.

 I guess I'm not the only magazine hoarder and since the files are much smaller than say movies or iso files, those add up really fast.
 I would like to find a way to be able to browse this collection a bit like a Plex server, to be able to browse the covers, mark a magazine as read, add tags etc.
 I specify that I tested the Komga server which is perfect for comics/manga but not at all suitable for magazines. This is because Komga can only support (in magazine display and processing) one level of folders. Thus, in the case of a tree structure organized by year of publication, it will consider each year as a different magazine...
 Maybe a simpler solution exists. How do you do it dear hoarders?

 so I own something on physical media like a cd or dvd and I make a backup of it digitally. but what if I don't own the dvd or cd anymore? what can I do with the physical media? do I have to bin it? and can't resell it, right? can a person give it away for free to someone? I know its possible to buy software licence's from other people who bought a digital serial number to unlock software and no longer wish to own it. in those instances the software is transferred and that original owner no longer owns it, is the same principle applied to cd's and dvds? if the person sells it on then they can't keep a copy (?)
 I mean, it's far less clutter to just store all that media on a hard drive and then just get rid of the discs! I have had people give music and films to me for free, I don't want to keep the discs but wouldn't mind having a digital copy, should I bin the disc, donate it, or sell it?

Basically clients register and put order in, driver closest aknowledges that he can pick-up and deliver the freight/package, when pick-up scans the BOL ( Bill of Lading ) into the system, drives, delivers, scans signed BOL into the system ( maybe even scan directly the PDF on phone/tablet ). What I have seen in CodeCanyon is 2 or even 3 things combined, on separate systems (PHP/Firebase/Android), it will be costly to implement and not 100% sure it will work as intended.
 Seeing I work between 1-5 trucks at the moment, it does not make sense to me to invest too much into it ( 6% margin in transport in great economy ). I also have a NAS I can use to host ( WD MyCloud Home ), or cloud hosting available. And not really needed dedicated Android/IOS apps, as I understand PWA ( progressive web app ) might do the same function.
 What do you guys think? Am I crazy, or am I crazy?
 I am also not a programmer. I dabble in PHP installs, but that is about all ...
 Hit me like a rolling ball!

Server #1 nginx reverse proxy, vaultwarden, gitea, etc.
 Server #2 jellyfin
 Server #3 adguard
  
I have a wildcard certificate for the reverse proxy and I don't want to have to distribute that certificate to every server. All the things on server #1 are easy to set up, just proxy_pass the appropriate port and you're good to go. The other servers are a little trickier. I could proxy_pass with their IP and port, however nothing is stopping a user from accessing IP:port of that server directly. I could use UFW to only allow traffic from the IP of the reverse proxy, but with ARP spoofing I can sit between the proxy and the server and see all the unencrypted traffic. 
 I've never used VLANs, I don't own a switch or a router which allows for them, and I'm not entirely sure what features they provide but I've seen them used to isolate local networks. Would using VLANs be the right way to solve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using rsync to mirror media drives (primarily media files) for manual backups for years. It's straightforward but it's lacking:
  
Renaming is treated as a whole different file, so renaming files make backing up extremely inefficient.
 
I use a wrapper script to keep a list of rsync logs as well as list of files on the drive after the last backup. Actually, I create a empty placeholder files on my filesystem and use fsearch to quickly search all files on the system including these placeholder files to quickly find if I have an existing file of that name.
 
 I know there are some rsync-based wrappers that might handle the filename change limitation, but I'm wondering if a dedicated backup software like Restic/Kopia/Borg is appropriate. I'm particularly interested in Kopia as it seems to be performant and modern in design (I know Borg is tried and true but it's been 7 years since multithreading was requested but it's still not supported).
 Are features like builtin encryption (previously I have e.g. ext4 on LUKS), deduplication, and snapshoting particularly important for large media files? None of these seem too relevant given I don't change the media files often, just add and delete (though it would be nice to be able to use such files on e.g. text files). More importantly, does the usage require you to be more involved? Nothing beats a single backup (rsync) command and also being able to access the files directly on the filesystem, viewing the contents like any other file. I believe you can mount the filesystems on such software, but on Youtube, everyone seems to always highlight the fact that you can list the files and open them with none showing that you can mount it as a filesystem, which seems to be way more intuitive and useful. 
 Much appreciated. I plan on moving the external HDDs to the Pi and backing up to it to remove clutter from my workspace.

 I've found the link to a youtube video from a long lost banned account.
 When I visit the link it loads the Youtube page and then the video keeps loading, I've seen people say it can take hours before the video has finished loading, so I have it in the background and have my fingers crossed.
 ​
 However... If I try and download the video via https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/ICvB8ptbNEE I get the message :
 "Hrm.
 The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL.
 This page is not available on the web
 because of server error"
 ​
 So, does the video even exist at all? Clearly it is loading something ?
 Link to the snapshot : https://web.archive.org/web/20210204000214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICvB8ptbNEE

 I wonder if the projects that we share here would use a platform like https://bookmytime.dev/, would we all see this as beneficial?
 I'm mainly posting this so that the community as well as those contributing to it with their awesome projects will know that this option exists, and that I personally think, given the opportunity - something like this would go a long way.
 Heck, even allowing teams of people to chip in to pay for a developer's time to fix some issue that as a community we would like to see fixed.
 Hope projects here adopt this model (don't care if they use this particular framework, but I do like the model).

So I also have a bunch of unused hard disks. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to convert the Sans Digital 4 bay eSATA cases to SAS. When I open up one of the Sans Digital cases, I see that there is a single eSATA to SATA cable running to the backplane. There is another ribbon cable for the activity lights and a couple molex connectors to the backplane. 
 Would this be worthwhile or just more trouble than its worth? If so, what are some decent, inexpensive, alternatives for an external 4/8bay SAS enclosures? I have about 20 drives I'd like to repurpose. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realise this is a bit of a nebulous question on my part (how do I define mostly idle, what other components (e.g. the PSU) does the machine have, what is a non-worry amount of power consumption cost).
 But what I'm really getting at is to get someone's sort of common sense perspective on whether a machine designed to be a gaming rig (circa 2014) could:
  
Make for a sensible home server (e.g. if it's the case that Linux PCs can sip power surprisingly well if not constantly doing active work)
 Or if it's the case that as a rule of thumb machines built to be gaming rigs will still consume an unreasonable amount of power even under idle with a light Linux installation, and it's better to just get something like a NUC.
  
I do have a Pi, and an old laptop, which I use for homelab sort of purposes, but neither can do transcoding well on things like Jellyfin/Plex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I currently have a Plex server running on a mini Windows desktop PC with an i5-8500 CPU and 8 gigs of RAM. It has a 256gb SSD and then all of my media is stored in two external drives of 1TB and 4TB.
 To be honest, this set up has done really well for me and changing it is not 100% necessary. However, 5TB of storage is no longer viable and I need to upgrade. Adding more external drives would be an option, but I don't really like the idea of having a bunch of drives laying around attached to my PC.
 So, I considered buying a hard drive dock, that would allow me to put in multiple drives and plug all into my computer with a single cable. However, at this point, I started to think that maybe it would just be worth it to go all the way and set up a NAS.
 Now, I have no idea on how NAS work other than watching a video or two on the subject. I also do not know what benefits I stand to gain from using one.
 As I said, my setup has worked well in terms of performance (I have at most 3 people watching at once). I do not have any 4k media, nor do I plan on having it anytime soon, but I would like for this to be viable.
 To sum up, I think it all boils down to this question - Do I go the dock route and keep everything simple or go all out and go for a NAS? What benefits does one have over the other? If it helps, my budget for this upgrade sits between 300-500€.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last few years, I've been using shucked drives and have come up with 2x 4tb hdds, with an additional 1tb nvme boot, 1 nvme gaming and 1 tb sata ssd for gaming as well. I'd like to either consolidate, and update the drives, because at the end of the day, they were of unknown backgrounds and I've started getting some warning signs like explorer freezing when opening text or .rar files.
 I saw a crucial mx500 4tb for $289, but would this be better than a hdd for my purpose? The hdds are to archive steam games mainly, so I won't have to download again, and blu-ray archiving.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I hope someone can help me here. So, I bought a second-hand Fujitsu Primergy RX100 S7 for €100. (It said it was from 2014, but looked brand new.) Now, I got home and tried to fire it up. It loaded into ESXi, but I didn’t have the root password, so I couldn’t log in, or shut down “safely”. I then powered it off by holding the power button, and now I need a password to even startup the server. I can’t enter the BIOS or boot menu. I asked the seller but she said that she didn’t use the server, so she didn’t have any passwords. Now, I can’t do anything with it. I tried default BIOS-passwords; didn’t work. Removing the CMOS-battery for the night; didn’t work. Can someone help me remove this password? Thanks in advance!

I’ll go for the highest quality versions of movies or TV shows that have special meaning to me, but for content I’m less interested in and just want to have around, 720p is fine. Lowest I’ve gone is 360p, mainly for long-running old shows that never had great picture quality to begin with.

 I am a contributor to REI3, a selfhosted low code platform. Its an open source alternative to tools like Ninox, Retool, Mendix and the like.
 Our latest major release just dropped - some highlights:
  
Multi factor authentication
 Major redesign of the application builder user interfaces
 Better form layouts with tabbed fields
 Integrated backups for all types of hosting/systems
  
We´ve been hard at work processing feedback and expanding the capabilities of what you can build with REI3.
 For those new to low code: The idea is that you can create your own custom software without the need for programming. You can create user interfaces, store data, send and process mails, and so on.
 We hope you like the new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have the following idea for setting up my home network/PCs.
 One last-gen PC with A+ CPU/GPU to be shared among: 
  
Room 1 (2nd floor): Low-latecy audio (DAW) and casual gaming.
 Room 2 (1st floor) : home-teather (main) and casual gaming.
 Potentially other rooms (max 1+).
  
A possibility is to run multiple virtual machines on the main PC (one per room), which is connected over wired LAN. Then, lowest-possible-cost PCs with small form factor (e.g. mini-PCs) located in the different rooms are used to connect to the VMs.
 Ethernet cables are already on place in the house (2 floors). All PCs need to be bought.
 Advantages: 
  
no additional wiring (!) to buy and deploy (such as A/V, USB) like I have seen in similar projects.
 low-latency applications (audio) will be run from Main PC directly (or via VM, but still physically at the main PC).
  
Disadvantages:
  
Round-trip latency to game from Room2 over LAN (reasonable to keep it below 10-15 ms?)
 Keeping costs of mini-PC very low (?) to make the idea meaningful.
 Noise from Main PC (Room1 used for audio recording)
  
Any feedback here would be helpful! Especially on which VM framework to use, and if the whole idea is realistic, of course.

 My thought is that I could put 4 pictures on my flatbed scanner then divide them up once I scan it. Seems like it would be faster than scanning one picture at a time. 
 Has anyone used a flatbed scanner to save old photos? What do you recommend? 
 EDIT: forgot to add.... I would like to buy an external HD to save the photos on. Is there a plug and play HD that I can move from one computer to another if needed? The last one I had many years ago was a major pain to use and required one to use western digital a software and I hated it. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm ready to move beyond exposure and understanding of what I'm working with infrastructure-wise to actually being responsible for buildout and maintenance, and before I start messing with edge technologies for multitenant environments (VRFs, etc.), I'd like to make sure I'm solid with my core virtualization infrastructure from a network perspective.
 I'm doing a hyper-v build soon since I'm more unfamiliar with it vs. vmware, but I'd like to have a pair of switches (stacked would be nice but is not necessary) that helps me understand the concepts that I'd be dealing with on a daily basis in a datacenter environment. I've considered sharing what I've designed so far, but since I'm open to hearing about what I don't know, I'll leave this open to everyone's interpretation and not prejudice your responses. Is anyone able to make a recommendation about where I should be focused, and what networking features (vxlan/varp/vrrp) and architectures (e.g. spine and leaf vs. a more traditional core/distribution/access model) should be interested in familiarizing myself with?
 I'm a quick study generally speaking so if you have thoughts or experience outside of what I've been exposed to, I might have follow-up questions. Either way, I appreciate the input, and believe me, I don't have any preconceptions that this is can be boiled down to a single post. Any and all feedback is appreciated.

So I have 12 SSDs and 6 NVMe drives in a machine with a 10G NIC and a 20 core CPU. note that this is all leftover hardware and pretty overkill for the purpose, but I plan to rebuild a more power-efficient version soon.
 I'm using TrueNAS on bare metal at the moment, and the storage pools are fast, but no docker capability means I have to setup a Linux VM for docker (currently using dietpi). I could also run Proxmox and run both TrueNas and linux in VMs. Or since I don't really need all the features of TrueNAS, I could just run Ubuntu Server and roll my own ZFS.
 What feels cleaner to y'all?

 Microsoft Office alternative (with up to 5 users), similar to what I have with O365 Family - I was thinking of OnlyOffice?
  Cloud Storage: to get away from Google Drive
  Possible separate photo storage: I like the iPhone photos app how it organizes by people/place. Are there any tools like that?
  
I currently have a Raspberry Pi 3 that I’m using to host Home Assistant. I think in order for me to do what I want, I’d need something beefier than that. So am I better off keeping the PI for Home Assistant and hosting everything with like GCP, Digital Ocean, or Linode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 over the last two-three years I just used duckdns + nginx proxy manager(npm) to expose the Nextcloud and Home Assistant instances on my home server for me and my family. To access all the other services I just used a wireguard connection back home whenever needed.
 Than a good friend asked if he could have access to my audiobookshelf(abs) and I opened up that too. After that more services got exposed for other friends too. (Till I hit the duckdns limit) So I decided to separate things again, and got a oracle free tier VPS and bought an domain last week. 
 On the VPS I installed npm and opened up the ports it needed to work. And here comes the first question. What's the best practice to deal with the port for the UI? Right now I block the port and whenever something needs to be done on the UI I open up the port in Oracle. So the connection to the UI during the changes is always unsecure. Maybe there are even better ways than using npm?
 After that I spinned up the docker container and added the subdomains for them to cloudflare. Where my second question evolved. When proxying traffic through cloudflare I am using their bandwidth are there any limitations regarding traffic? Would it be better to disable the proxy and just use it as a DNS? Now regarding SSL. I set the SSL to "Full (strict)" got one *.mydomain.xyz let's encrypt certificate with a DNS challenge in npm. But somehow the cloudflare certificate is being used instead the let's encrypt one. And assigned the wildcard cert to the proxies in npm. Everything works but I am not sure if it the correct way to set it up.
 So the public facing apps are now on oracle servers and I am now only my family is using my server back home.
 Any suggestions to improve things to be more secure? Maybe other suggestions too.
 Thanks for your time
 Cheers

 Recently, Nintendo started unlisting some of their other pages. I worry that these interviews are at risk.
 The site consists of a series of static pages that are all linking to each other, like a mini encyclopedia.
 I tried backing them up before, but I am not good enough at scripting to pull it off.
 Would really love it if someone could do this and maybe end up with a folder with all the htmls in there.

 My current server is an old desktop PC with an i7 4770k and 16GB of RAM, all in a Fractal Design R5 case and no graphics card. It was at first a gaming PC with the CPU overclocked, then it has been has been running 24/7 for almost 7 years as server and I have never had a single problem, I really appreciate this machine for its reliability. However, with time the electricity bill increases because of the important consumption of the CPU.
 My server uses Proxmox as a hypervisor and runs mainly:
  
x2 LXC Container (Pi-Hole & Minecraft Server)
 x4 VM: 
 Home Assistant
 Jellyfin
 Reverse Proxy
 Alpine Linux with docker to manage the rest of my services like nextcloud, bitwarden, miniflux, etc...
 
  
I'm looking to replace it all with a server that takes up less space and consumes less power.
 I also think to replace Proxmox by Fedora Server or Fedora CoreOS to use only containers with podman.
 I have two machines that hold my attention,
 The first one is the Lenovo ThinCenter M70q gen3 with an i5 and 16gb of ram, this product interests me a lot, but what I don't know is the noise pollution, my current server has a noctua ventirad and the Define R5 is totally silent, and I would like this little box to be as much.
 Second would be an Intel NUC 12 with i5 and 16GB of RAM. I'm less convinced because I'm not sure that this hardware is as reliable over time and may lack performance for some tasks, but it is probably the best for power consumption and noise.
 I'm also hesitating with the i3 model, I intend to get one or two more in the near future to make a cluster.
 Would you have an opinion on these two machines or others to recommend? 
 I thought about the Dell Optiplex but in France they are sold with a Windows license, which means an extra cost.
 Thanks,

I intend on only ripping non-UHD disks for the forseeable future. Do I need to flash the drive anyways, or is that only for ripping UHD?
 I saw that I could use an LG WH14NS40 or LG WH16NS40. I would need an enclosure. Would buying them straight from Amazon be an okay method?

 I am considering getting one of the TrueNAS systems, but that's a big splurge. $1000+ and that's not even including the cost of the drives themselves.
 I have seen on PC Part Picker that I can get ECC compatible processors in the $50 range, but the motherboards are in the $500 range (yikes). Still better than buying a TrueNAS machine, but once I've bought all the other parts (RAM, power supply, graphics card, case) I could see it being closer in price to the expensive TruaNAS.
 I think I've discovered a good option. On both Amazon and eBay are a lot of refurbished Dell and HP Xeon desktops. They vary in price from $100-500. The Xeon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation is simple: I have a Proxmox node, and I want to spin up a few Debian or Alpine Linux VMs automatically using declarative configuration, and get to the point where I can run Ansible playbooks on them. I think Terraform would be good for creating VMs.
 I was originally going to build some images using debootstrap or Alpine's equivalent, customize the images a bit and upload them, but it seems like the Proxmox Terraform provider doesn't support that method. That means I have to use either PXE, cloud-init, or preprovision. Preprovision only supports Ubuntu and CentOS, so that's an instant dealbreaker.
 I looked around for some posts about cloud-init, and they seem kind of split on whether it's useful or not. Some people mentioned:
  
Ansible can do everything it can
 Hypervisors usually have templating features already
 cloud-init is for datacenters and you should use Packer and PXE boot
  
PXE boot sounds complicated to set up. Do you think cloud-init is good for this usecase?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been data hoarding for about a year now. I've bought several external hard drives ranging from 1TB-5TB to store everything (Seagate and WD). I didn't have too much data at first, and I like how they are portable and easy to plug and play on other devices.
 My question is, would it be more cost effective to buy internal hard drives like 3.5" NAS HDDs and buy a cheap enclosure to go with it? For example I've seen 10TB+ Internal Drives sell for cheaper than pre-enclosed external ones, but I dont know if I would need an extra power source other then the USB plug that comes with a portable enclosure. I also wouldn't be opposed to go with a smaller drive if the extra power is needed on larger drives.
 I am no where near setting up a home server or using a cloud based system, just looking to plug into the TV through USB for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m considering moving from a big server to NUCs or micro PCs to ultimately save power and just down size a bit. So anyone that has done this, how satisfied are you? Any regrets or gotchas?
 For reference my main rig is a white box dual Xeon E5-2698 V4 / 256 GB Ram / dual 10g NICs/ 1660 Ti for transcoding - on proxmox. Running about 7 VMs and 25 containers.
 Mass storage is external on a synology DS1821+
 Power here isn’t terribly expensive @ 0.10 / kWh. But lab a low use / idle draws about 415 watts

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellas, I have a few channels I scrape occasionally on Bitchute using a custom script I wrote and using yt-dlp. I've noticed that a lot of older videos no longer archive, and when I check the videos on Bitchute they no longer load - so it's not an issue with my script or yt-dlp. The latest channel I tried to archive cut off at a video on December 3, 2019 - and all videos older than that are no longer playing on the website. 
 Is this an issue with Bitchute automatically no longer hosting videos once they've been uploaded for a certain amount of time? Anyone else run into this problem? Any input is helpful. Thanks guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 Please share with me some ideas on how to tackle this.
 I woud like to auto-upload Blueiris JPEGs to Mega as they are being created. I would also like to monitor the space available and delete the oldest so that I can stay under my 20GB max.
 Requirements:
  
Upload JPEGs in real-time (5 second delay max)
 Be aware of max storage cap and auto-delete the oldest
 Encrypt on the fly
 
I'm not married to Mega so I'm happy to use other options with 15+ GB of free storage 
 No Google Drive 
 Protocol/platform is flexible (SFTP and Object Storage is fine too)
 
 Host machine is capped at 10GB while remote will have 20GB, so host machine will delete oldest before remote
  
​
 I know that I can do this with Rclone with some scripting, but I wanted to know if there was other better options. Ex: Restic? duplicity? borg? Rsync? I haven't used these myself. Thank you for your help!

 Everything under eth1 is what I'd want to achieve rather than the setup I have right now.
 My goal is to have multiple separate subnets which would contain virtual machines that are capable of reaching other machines within the subnet, but not the machines in other subnets, or machines within my LAN (192.168.0.0/24). Simultaneously, I want machines inside the subnets to be resolvable and reachable by external (outside of LAN) clients.
 My experience with networking is limited to esxi, and networking stack of linux is somewhat alien to me, so I would appreciate if not a fully detailed guide on how to achieve my goal, then at least a few helpful pointers on how I can do that with the tools that proxmox provides (that being, the entirety of Linux's networking stack). Thanks!

However, take 5 pages from 10 different websites, comeback in 3 months and you will quickly realize half the links are broken, content has changed or has been completely lost. Everyday thousands of new websites are created and shut down.

 Currently I use Dashlane as my password manager and I’m thinking of moving to a self hosted solution since I’ve just got my homelab setup. I know a lot of people have been recommending bitwarden and have a few questions before I move over:
  
Does it require much maintenance? I.e management of database, fixing errors and updates?
 
Does Bitwarden support MFA? In addition to being a password manager I’d like my self hosted solution to support MFA codes built into the app.
 
Does Bitwarden have an addon for Brave which autofills login forms automatically? Say I’m on twitter.com will it recognise the website and fill in the password automatically?
 
Can Bitwarden run in docker?
 
In general what issues have people faced with Bitwarden and is there anything I need to be aware of when setting it up/using it?
 
 Thanks in advance!!🙂

 Hello
 I wanna buy a new HDD, im choosing between:
 ​
 Toshiba P300 6TB (HDWD260UZSVA)
 and
 Seagate BarraCuda 6TB ( ST6000DM003)
 ​
 In the shop in my country, in my language (not english) it says for Toshiba: "MTBF 600000 hours" and for Seagate: "Reliability 300000 cycles".
 ​
 Is "MTBF" (Mean time Before Failure) the same as "Reliability Cycles"...? I did the translation from my language to english as good as i can.
 Are they the same?
 If not, which one is Better?
 ​
 600 000 Hours MTBF
 or
 300 000 Reliability Cycles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've browsed this subreddit and others quite a bit on this topic, but I'm in search of a few specific things and it's pretty time-consuming trying out different options, I'm hoping someone with experience can help. I've been running both my music and ebook libraries from my desktop and I'd like to move them to my home server.
 Music: currently I'm running MediaMonkey on my desktop, adding specific songs to a "Phone" playlist to sync with my Android via MediaMonkey's app. This works okay but it'd be nice to be able to access my large library remotely when I'm on wifi and not be reliant on sitting at my desktop for adding new songs to my phone.
 Features: 
  
able to stream library from my local desktop 
 able to download select songs/albums/artists to my Android for playing remotely without data
 also be able to stream songs to my Android when on wifi (remotely)
 95% of my music listening is from my phone with no data available, and my full library is enormous - so it'd be nice if most of the time only the downloaded songs are shown so that I don't need to sift through the rest of my unavailable library 
  
A Jellyfin server + S2 android app seems like a good option here - but I haven't had a chance to test this combo out yet.
 Books: currently I have Calibre on my desktop and upload books to BookFusion for reading via Android and web. BookFusion is great but I'd like something selfhosted and not limited to X books in my library. 
 Features: 
  
accessible via Android app, which allows downloading for reading offline
 accessible via web 
 syncs/remembers progress between platforms
 allows annotations (highlighting and notes) with the ability to export them 
  
If I can't find something selfhosted I'll probably switch to Google Play Books.
 Thanks for any help you can provide - and thanks for all the help this subreddit has already given, it's been a great resource as I've built up my home server.

 I'm trying to use ipmitool over my home LAN (no specific network configuration, no firewall, no VLAN) on my Dell PowerEdge R720 (running VMware ESXi 7.0) but I can't get it to work. What's really weird is that its configuration is identical to my other Dell PowerEdge server (which is an R720XD), for which it works... Here is my iDRAC network configuration :
 https://preview.redd.it/y3zginenpf9a1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0dfaab9e50e15d5b38696f9cfec3474c52f8d2f
 Here is the command I try to run as a test :
  ipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.1.190 -U root -P PASSWORD sdr elist all 
 And the error message I get :
  
Error: Unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session
  
Any idea ? 🤔

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been seeing a lot of posts lately about OAuth providers like Authentik and Authelia. I decided to try out Authentik (using Windows AD as the backend) and I've been really impressed with it so far. 
 However, I've been having a bit of an issue. I can't seem to figure out how to pass group information to the application through OAuth. Some applications don't support LDAP, so it's not an option for me to use it to get permissions through groups. I'm trying to decide whether I should use LDAP as much as possible to get permissions through groups, or if I should consider every user a regular user and use application-specific local admin accounts. 
 Any advice on this would be appreciated. Thanks!

 1) Do any of you use compression, in any form, for either backups, local storage, or cloud?
 Files I'm considering compressing:
 2) I have a LOT of games downloaded, which I do not currently play, but plan on returning to. One example would me Skyrim +150 Mods, which took weeks to figure out the right combination of mods 
 3) I have about 500 GB - 1TB or so of old data that I'm slowly going through, and deleting or saving anything that's personally important.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got lots of valuable input regarding exposing some of my services here and i am experimenting with some of the approaches now.
 One of the things i want to set up is proper monitoring. All my services are behind a Traefik Reverse Proxy. I would like to avoid going through the access log every now and then and manually check it and instead have some kind of dashboard. The following metrics are something i would be interested in:
  
CrowdSec/Fail2ban metrics (number of blocked requests / banned IPs, ...)
 Number of requests grouped by return code, endpoint , ...
 IP geolocations
 ...
  
I was thinking about the ELK stack, however it seems to be quite heavy for a small homeserver. As far as i am aware a slightly more lightweight solution would be Promtail + Loki + Grafana. However i couldn't really find a lot of information/guides on how to use this stack in combination with Traefik/Fail2ban/CrowdSec to setup a monitoring dashboard.
 Another project i've found is GoAccess, which ticks many of the boxes, but i'm not quite sure how to integrate CrowdSec and Fail2ban metrics (or if it's possible at all).
 Whats your setup when it comes to monitoring your exposed services and trying to detect the worst case of an successful attack?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written something to scratch a personal itch, and it might perhaps be useful to others since there doesn't seem to be anything else available to do it.
 It allows you to cast audio from the YouTube app on Android (and I presume iOS too) to a DLNA renderer (wifi speaker, streaming receiver etc.).
 You run it on any device on your network and each renderer you have will show up in the Cast menu in the app.
 Pause, play, stop and volume controls in the app are mapped through to the renderer. (Seek doesn't work. Maybe I'll fix it one day.)
 It's pretty basic but I find it very useful. I hope others may get some use out of it - let me know if you do, and/or if you hit problems. It hasn't had a great deal of long-term testing - at the moment I just run it up (on Ubuntu 22.04) when I need it. It's also the first real thing I've written in Javascript so there could well be rookie mistakes.
 It's called upnpTube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built haystack - natural language search engine for workplace technical knowledge.
 My name is Yuval I've been a software engineer for a few years now,
 A few weeks ago I was scrolling through confluence pages trying to find ssh connection details to our jenkins second integration machine for 40 minutes straight, later I discovered my co-worker slack'ed me the ssh connection string two months ago.
 A week later I started working on haystack - a search engine for workplace apps.. It enables you to search slack, confluence, jira, teams, jfrog, github, and email in one place.
 It supports natural language queries so a query like: "how to connect to integ2 machine?" yields:
 ssh -i private.pem ubuntu@ec2-integration2.eu-est-1.compute.amazonaws.com 
 Privacy?
 haystack is self hosted and stores user data locally, and is totally client-side - only you have access to internal docs, I didn't want to deal with security compliance headaches caused from storing user data in the cloud + I don’t want your internal docs/messages.
 Rolled it out to my co-workers a week ago and they thought it's a hit, so I'm planning on releasing it publicly on March 2023.
 Early access
 If you want to try it out before March 2023 - Available here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was researching NAS options and came across an offer for cloud storage priced at $1200 for 10TB lifetime. One time payment. By comparison that cost will get you 2 years of Google Drive storage. Based on that alone it looks like a win but what other factors do you consider when gauging the cost of data storage. I'm not talking about the pros and cons of cloud vs. local storage. I already get that. I'm asking, IF cloud storage could work for you, how valuable will 10TB be in 5, 10, 20 years. As media file sizes get bigger with 8K and photos grow in megapixels, will 10TB in the future get you what 500GB gets you today? Will the failure rate of NAS drives become a non issue when pricing storage? I have no use for 10TB of cloud storage now but down the line I probably will. If so, is this deal worth it?

 ​
 Does this section ever actually change?
 === START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
 SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
 My current plan is to run short tests once a week and check that passed. I know this will mean not paying attention to things like increasing read or write errors but seems to be something I can reasonably automate.
 In more detail I'll be looking at:
 smartctl -j -a /dev/sda|jq .smart_status
 {
 "passed": true
 }

 Anyone have any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Hoarders,
 A couple of year-ish back, the WD Blue SN550 with the go-to, with a nice fast 1.2TB or so per second write, and sustaining a respectable 850MBps post cache.
 Ever since the chip swap in 2021, it remains fast (faster, in fact) for the SLC portion, then drops to 370MBps. Not acceptable.
 Does anyone know who the budget king of NVME currently is?
 I'm really only looking for one key feature:
 sustained writes that are notably faster than SATA, after cache is exhausted
 750MB-1000MB would be nice. Price is a key factor.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello.
 i have not previously owned a multi monitor setup, but i really need one. and im going to do that but several challenges and questions lay ahead.
 firstly i own an AMD card, i wanted to know how it actualy is if you try to connect a few monitors to 1 GPU and a couple more to another GPU (of same gpu model) i have heard and seen very conflicting info from different sources, some say it works very good, some say it doesn't, some says it works but can be challenging to work with. what is the truth?
 also my budget is limited, the more monitors the better for my usecase. but i also want to have a stable setup, i want to use my budget as wisely as possible so i can have more left over for other things for my computer setup. so my question is, if i buy a very good monitor for the main one, and then buy multiple of a worse less resolution or size (or even a different brand) monitors, will that create chalanges and mess up the UX in any ways? will it create confusion for the PC when moving the mouse between different res screens because of different positioning? also how will it work both in linux and windows because i use both?
 and lastly if i try to connect my display port monitors to DP, and at same time connect more HDMI monitors using a hdmi>DP adapter to the display ports on the GPU will it create complications or DeSync of latency between displays?
 my overall goal and view is that i want my set up to be just as plug and play as if i had all the same monitors all with DP, and also get as many monitors as possible while trying to save money.
 thank you.

 Is this something to be concerned about? It only sometimes makes this louder version of what would be considered normal hard drive noises when reading/writing to it. You can even hear at the end of the video it quiets down and returns to normal. The disk passed a SMART test and there's no values in the SMART output that would indicate any kind of failure or damage.

Right now, I manually update containers as I see fit (or when I can be bothered), however, I'm going to spend some time automating this over the next few days and wanted to get a feel for what others are doing.

 I am trying to get NUT working correctly on a setup I am attempting to...setup.
  
 The issue I am having is that none of the devices connected to the NUT server are doing what they are told.
 For example, I have set (on a test system), that particular system to shutdown when the battery gets to 99%, and a second test system set to shutdown at 90%.
  
 If I remove the power (other than this brand new UPS immediately dropping to 80%!!!) neither system shuts down, but does immediately receive a syslog message about the UPS being on battery.
 Now, I am not confident i have my configs setup correctly.
  
 Config wise -

But one of the things I really like about my Synology is that I can hot swap the drives and if the drives fail there are lights on the front and the system beeps.
 That got me wondering if there are hard drives enclosures for multiple drives that would provide the hot swap capability and visual notifications. A quick search either found NAS system or small 4 bay enclosures.
 Suggestions please

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to follow this guide to better protect my network while running some game servers on my Dell T440 for our Discord server. 
 Guide: https://www.howtogeek.com/440752/protect-your-home-minecraft-server-from-ddos-attacks-with-aws/
 I've gotten most of the way through without issue until it comes to configuring SSLH. Not only is the config file not in the location as stated in the guide it seems to be missing quite a few lines towards the end of the file. 
 I found a thread where someone else had the same issue, but the fix in this thread doesn't work for me either. https://forum.level1techs.com/t/configure-sslh/151892/13 
 Both the guide and thread could be outdated, or I could still just be screwing it up, but I'm unsure of what to try next. 
 I have set the AWS port forward settings as "Inbound, custom UDP, Range: 16261-16262, Source 0.0.0.0/0. (Note: For some reason when I added the port rules for the game it blocked me out of SSH until I added another rule to allow my home IP to connect via port 22. Idk if I did something wrong here as well.)
 Should I keep at this method or is there a better way? Thanks in advance!
 ​
 (Server: Dell T440, Proxmox VE, VM: LinuxGSM.)
 (Note: The game server is working just using my public IP)

I’ve started to corral them in one place to weed out duplicates and keep the best versions, but I’m stuck on one thing. How do I download things I’ve purchased from various sites that are hosted on those sites and not my device. For example, I buy audiobooks from Chirp. I can listen to them using their app, but I want to get them saved so I can listen to them even if I don’t have an internet connection.

 I could (but would rather not) write a python script to poll my actual email account, but I'd rather find free email account that I can automatically forward the emails to and then pull from that, then run an automation for each new email that comes in. There must be a solution out there already, how are people getting this done? I don't want to run an email server myself, that's a whole can of worms I don't want to deal with, and I don't need to be event-based; polling a couple times a day would be enough.
 I did a bit of searching here and /r/selfhosted, but mostly people are talking about syncing/archiving emails, which is not what I'm trying to solve; as soon as I grab the input and launch the automation I'll trash the email.

 I am new to networking so i need some advice currently i have a vps in which has tailscale vpn and is in locked down state by following this guide, thus i can ssh only when i am connected to vpn but if i host uptimekuma using docker i am able to access it via vpsip:port combo (ex 10.10.10.10:999) is there any way for me to block this from happening, apart from this i also want cloudflare tunnel to tunnel my uptimekuma instance to my subdomain which will be public is this doable??
 Note- both cloudflared and tailsale are installed in baremetal
 my current ufw status is 
 ``` Status: active Logging: on (low) Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed) New profiles: skip
 To Action From
  
Anywhere on tailscale0 ALLOW IN Anywhere
 Anywhere (v6) on tailscale0 ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6)
 ``` What i have tried so far 
 1- tried blocking all outgoing connection (this results in me unable t login to vps even after connecting to vpn had to manually deny it using hoster's web console )
 2- tried to host cloudflared and uptime kuma in same network but this also not works described in this post
 Am currently lost

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jesus! I have several Seagate Barracuda drives - ST2000DM001-1ER164. Granted I've had them a few years now but all have started to fail. The first that failed was in my dad's PC. Then suddenly I turned my PC on one day, that had 3 of them in and although working the day before just fine, one of them failed. So it was time to backup the rest. I purchased Hard Disk Sentinel and checked the remaining drives. All fine. I turn the PC on today and check out qtorrent for some ongoing archive downloads and it keeps freezing. Odd, seems to be doing it on just one torrent so I'm trying to delete but can't.
 I realise something similar was happening when one died early in the year so run Hard Disk Sentinel and it flags the drive health at 26%. JESUS! I've only copied 2 new folders to it recently so back those up. There is another one in the machine still showing 100% heath but Jesus they have been poor. All purchased round the same time roughly, all dying roughly round the same time!
 Never buying Seagate again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all! 
 I'd like to 'burn in' my RAID for several hours (or days) before I start to copy data over. I'm still new to all this, but had a blast setting up my first NAS server with a 24TB RAID (4x8TB RAID-Z) on TrueNAS Scale. This will eventually be a media server. 
 One of the reasons why I want to burn-in at the RIAD level, rather than the disk level (e.g. SMART test or badblocks), is because I'm concerned about my PSUs ability to power multiple drives running simultaneously. All of my issues over the last few weeks have been when the disks passed both SMART and badblocks, but the RAID failed over and over. I followed advice online and since upgraded my PSU and power cables. 
 I had the idea that I could just torrent a massive amount of data for a week. This would effectively stress the I/O in proportion to its anticipated use. Is there a free torrent that would accomplish this? I don't want to sign up for any sites where maintaining a ratio is a concern: If the RAID fails, I'd like to be able to repeat the test. 
 I'm open to other suggestions as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our research group has about 150TB of data we're currently storing with some cloud service that's costing us a lot monthly. We also have a new project starting in 2025 which will generate a similar amount of data. I've been tasked with building a file server to be housed somewhere on campus to hold this data.
 Data access pattern:
  
Copy a 500GB chunk of data to the campus compute cluster (about 1h transfer time at 1Gb/s)
 Do some computation on the cluster over this 500GB of data (takes about 30h)
 Delete the 500GB chunk from the cluster and move on to the next chunk
  
Purchase list:
  
Data hosting ($12000)
  
45Drives Storinator Q30 ($7000)
 14x 16TB Seagate Exos drives w/ RAID-Z2 ($5000)
 
 
Data backup ($5750)
  
Symplypro SYPRO-DT3L8H1B-A0 desktop tape drive ($5000)
 14x 12TB HPE LTO-8 tapes ($750)
 
  
I've left half the drive bays empty for building another array a few years from now.
 Questions:
  
Approximately what's the likelihood that a drive will fail in 5 years?
 How complex is the replacement? I may not always be around to fix the server
 About how long would a rebuild take if a drive fails, and is double-parity enough to prevent another drive from failing during this time?

 Goals
  
Run a web scraping bot I wrote
 Run another web-oriented bot
 Be a development environment for Haskell, whose compiler loves RAM and CPU power
 Eventually be a NAS
 Have some room to do more stuff as I think of it!
  
Parts
  
 Part Model Link 
  
 CPU Ryzen 7 3700X (8 core, 16 threads) Link 
  CPU Cooler Wraith Prism (stock with CPU)  
  Motherboard ASUS PRIME B550M-A/CSM Link 
  RAM Corsair 32 GB module Link 
  Gfx Card ATI Radeon HD 3470 (lol) Link 
  Case Thermaltake Core V21 Link 
  PSU Thermaltake Smart 500W Link 
  SSD TeamGroup 1TB PCIe 3.0 Link 
 
 Comments
  
I'm so excited about this! I haven't built a PC since I was a kid and it's so much fun
 The plan is to run Proxmox and have VMs for the different bots / environments
 I love the idea of having 16 threads to work with for different VMs
 I started with a single 32 GB RAM module so I can add more if I need/want
 It's a "gaming" motherboard, but it's a nice price and I think it'll work. I didn't see many better options.
 The cube case is the only thing fits in my home lab cabinet. Unfortunately I don't have space for a server rack
 No built-in graphics with the Ryzen CPU, but you can get a really old card for $9 on ebay!
 Cost pre-tax and pre-shipping is ~ $500
  
Questions
  
 How is this build for power usage? Anything I can or should do to reduce it?
  I eventually want to get a couple 2TB HDDs and use this as a NAS. I was thinking ZFS mirroring for them. I also have a brand new 2.5in 500GB SSD lying around, could that be involved? What's the best setup in Proxmox?
  I assume that I'll have to get out a USB drive to update the motherboard BIOS from time to time, is that right?
 Anything else about this setup you think I should know or look into?
  
Thanks! 😁

 I have a 2-disk synology, each has 2TB disk. My usage is to store mp3, movie. and if data is lost I am Ok.
 I'd like to leverage full capacity of total 4 TB disk and don't want to go with SHR.
 if one disk fail, I hope the data on another disk survive.
 should I
 option 1: create "basic" raid type, and create 2 storage pool (each has 1 volume, pointing to one of the disk), or
 option 2: 1 storage pool with 2 volume?
 I am open to other options. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Looking for some monitoring software that keeps track of any changes of my file that I want to back up. My most important files are the irreplaceable home videos and pictures for the last 25 years or so. I have multiple backups of these and keep them up-to-date, doing a full new backup every now and then. 
 Was just doing a new full backup today and it occurred to me that what if something happens to the original files, like some file accidentally deleted or corrupted. I might notice it years later (or maybe never). When doing new full backups, said files would be eventually lost. 
 I know file versioning would be an option, but eventually that will hit a wall over the years and doesn't really help if I don't notice the changes and make a new full back up.
 So basically I want to have some kind of monitoring software that looks for changes and integrity in the background and informs me of any changes that happen. 
 Something light, easy to use and of course free would be nice. ;)

 I dont want to use wireguard directly because chromecast wouldn't work that way. Also every user would need wireguard installed on their devices.
 First off, let me show you what I am trying to do: https://i.imgur.com/8tvKW4w.jpeg
 Explanation:
 - I want to have a wireguard tunnel between my VPS and my local docker network to route my services to the internet.

 Mydomain is pointed at my VPS.

It essentially indexes every webpage you want and adds it to your own search index, which you can then search using full-text search. No tag management, no summary or title management needed. 
 As I do not want to depend on a third party service for keeping all my bookmarks, as I never could be safe, they are not just closing doors one day, I al searching for a self hosted solution, to do something like this.
 Does anyone know a simple service, I could spawn locally in my home network (I don’t need access outside of it), to archive the same. All my internet searches on this unfortunately did not yield any results.

How can I configure the nginx-mailcow container to have no port bindings added to it (I don't need them if i can access the container via hostname directly and use port 80)?
 The only way I can see so far is to directly edit the docker-compose file, which is discouraged in the documentation. I can't even create a docker-compose.override.yml file becuase for some reason, override files in docker compose don't actually override arrays (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3729), so I can't remove the entries already present in the "ports" list for the nginx-mailcow service!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure how relevant those drives are to big data hoarders considering that they are NVME SSDs topping out at 2TB, however I was having a look at the data sheet looking at their endurance and there seems to be two different hardware revisions currently in circulation with way different endurance.
 The earlier/older Firecuda 520 drives had ZP2000GM30002, ZP1000GM30002, ZP500GM30002 product codes and used to have an endurance of 3600TBW, 1800TBW and 850TBW respectively. As far as I am aware these drives used to use Toshiba Bics Flash.
 Meanwhile, if you browse the data sheet of the current Firecuda 520 drives page on Seagate's website, these drives now carry the ZP2000GV3A012, ZP1000GV3A012 and ZP500GV3A012 product codes with an endurance of 1200TBW, 600TBW and 300TBW respectively.
 It also seems to me like the new "Firecuda 520" drives have a different packaging, and a different label on the drives itself with a white notch and line on top right corner of the label while the older version with much higher endurance have a thick orange line at the bottom of the label with "520 series PCIe Gen4 SSD" written on it instead.
 Here are the two PDFs / data sheets on Seagate's website :
 Older revision with Toshiba NAND and higher endurance : DATA SHEET (seagate.com)
 Newer revision with lower endurance : Upgrade Your Gaming Experience (seagate.com)
 Not sure how relevant this is to you data hoarders considering the rather low capacity of the drives, but I thought that this might be an interesting piece of information nonetheless.
 How common is it for drive manufacturers to sneakily revise and change the hardware on their drives while selling them under the same name ? I vaguely remember that happening a couple of years ago with a couple of manufactures such as Adata, Crucial, WD or even Samsung.
 I might cross-post this to the hardware subreddit if there is any interest in that discussion and if I manage to figure out how to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, let me tell you that I am not a Data Hoarder, but I thought this question was probably suited best for this community.
 I want to get a fat-ass hard drive (>10TB) so I can keep a full backup of my Steam account, just in case, something happens to steam. The hard drive would sit inside of my computer case, and it will be connected as a separated drive in my computer.
 However I have heard that large hdd are (very) noisy. which makes sense, if they are thought to be in a data center and not inside of a personal computer.
 Do you have any additional information, on how loud they are, which one are best, what is a good Tb/$ price?
 Also, maybe there is another cheaper solution that I have not considered?
 ​
 The HDD that I have in mind is this one: https://www.cclonline.com/st16000nm000j-seagate-exos-x18-16tb-sata-iii-3-5-hard-drive-7200rpm-256mb-384942/
 ​
 PS: In principle it would be only one given the steep price. Might need to add a second backup eventually.

 Got a newbie question about media management and hard links.
 Stack: Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett, qBittorrent
 I've got Sonarr/Radarr working with Jackett and qBittorrent. Hardlinks are working fine between qBittorrent's download folder and Sonarr/Radarr root folder. 
 My question is, am I suppose to periodically clean up the qBittorrent's download folder and leaving the other copies in Sonarr/Radarr?

Since the format has been deprecated as of 2018, and with (what I assume is) the progression of web browsers, the few I have no longer "play" in Apple Music or as HTML content. But it was really good and informative content when used well by the studios. 
 I've tried to find an archive of these but so far been unsuccessful. Anyone save and archive ITLP content (not the music, just the .itlp media directories for albums where they were available via iTunes)?

 I have approx 1.5TB in my Google Drive (Workspace, single-user) I’d like to transfer over to Backblaze. I’m trying to work out all possible options, but looking for some advice ideally from someone who’s done this/something similar before
 Option 1 Download all data From Google Drive onto home server, then upload to Backblaze. No cost involved but with 10mb/s upload speed will take a long time
 Option 2 Spin up VPS on AWS EC2, rclone copy from google drive to B2. Not an expert on rclone, would I have to assign 1.5TBs EBS storage to the VPS to complete the sync? Will also get hammered on ingress/egress charge
 Option 3 Multcloud/Cloudfuze. Waiting to hear on a quote from Multcloud, and Cloudfuze do not support Backblaze (despite it being S3 compatible…)

I have a MergerFS pool consisting of a 4tb HBB, 1tb HDD, 750GB HDD, and a 500GB HDD with an 8TB HDD for snapraid backup. The first disk in my pool (4TB) is at 99% capacity but all of the other disks read as 0%. For some reason it appears as though everything is saving to just the 4TB disk and then making the entire MergerFS pool appear to be "full". Any help or suggestions?

 I’ve recently gotten my hands on an X13SAE-F and some other hardware to build a homelab system. I installed a i3-12100 (using to update BIOS to support 13th gen) and Micron 32 GB ECC Udimm (MTC20C2085S1EC48BA1R). However, the board will not post and has error beeps (I believe its two short beeps and one long beep). I don’t see this error beep code in the appendix I am thinking that maybe the Micron ram is not supported and I need to order the Supermicro UDIMMs when they come in stock, but maybe the issue is something else
 Here is a video of the beep and memory (I currently have one out of two sticks installed since I was swapping them around to see if it would fix it) https://imgur.com/a/rkUtgMT
 And by no posting I mean theres no HDMI output. by the beeps im assuming its not posting but Im a total supermicro noob so…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I had an Iomega NAS from 2011 but the fan failed last year. I changed them 2 times but the new fans don't last (it's the same ID model but they doesn't work the same). I would like to salvage my 2tb drive and put it in another enclosure, I can format the drive to another file allocation table as I can still access files and move them on my current USB drives. I don't need raid or any server capacities, I just want the HDD available over my network. Only important stuff are pictures but those are backup in 3 places in 3 different spaces (2 USB drives + Cloud). My main usage is purely ease of use for my family; instead moving files around over USB drive, I prefer to have a single network IP that every device can access via SMB. Thanks a lot for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! ... 
 I'm in the process of upgrading my home network and I need to build a NAS. 
 From the research I've been doing on different NAS drives, it seems the common sentiment is that they're noisy for a Home Lab. 
 My 24U rack sits next to my desk where I do most of my work, it's within arms reach, do you think NAS drives will be too noisy for that situation, and if so, would any of you know any alternatives I could use? 
 I really only need 10 or so Terabytes, so just a few 4TB drives or even 2TB drives would be fine. 
 I thought about going with SSD's, but would be pretty expensive for large storage amounts, and I've heard that regular HDD's probably wouldn't last very long. This won't be a very heavily used NAS, just used for storage and only really accessed a few times a day. 
 Also, as a sidenote, I'm also upgrading the internal network to 10g so the faster the NAS the better, I'm mostly using it for storing video and music recordings. 
 Anybody have any drive suggestions I could look at?

 Requirements are simply:
  
ECC RAM
 At least 3 SATA ports
  
Not looking for rack-mountable. I'm aiming for as close to $500 as possible (before the cost of drives). Is there anything modern like those N40L servers?
 All the current-gen microservers are at least $900 and more like $2500. I considered the Dell T40 but it only includes one hard drive bay despite having more than one SATA port...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I'm looking to add a managed switch behind my pfSense router in order to separate LANs. 
 My pfSense runs on a m720q from Lenovo within Proxmox. My m720q has 3 NICs. One for Proxmox (might change since i'm currently in a double NAT configuration), one for pfSense WAN, one for pfSense LAN. No SR-IOV on my NICs but i'm not sure that would benefit me anyway. 
 I think the best solution would be to add a managed switch behind my pfSense LAN NIC. This managed switch would provide at least three VLANs, one for my NAS / homelab gear, one for private network (NICs in walls in every room, wifi AP), and one for smart home devices. 
 I've read that this sub doesn't like consumer grade gear and prefer used entreprise gear. I agree with that but couldn't fit a whole 19" switch, since I'm building my homelab within a small furniture, which max width is about 12" (30cm).
 From here do you know about an afordable new / refurbished / used model that would fit my need ? I tend to like Tp Link and Mikrotik as they seem to have good overall value. 
 MIKROTIK RB260GS looks like a good solution, what do you think ? 
 Thanks a lot !

 I've seen some answers that some M.2 drives work but not others but no answer on a ssd. I also see some saying the drive will show up but not work as a boot drive. I guess that's not a big deal if it won't work as a boot as I still get to keep the same amount of drives but just not sure if this adventure is worth the time and money to figure out if it will work.

I want to upgrade because I'm now on a 1000/20 connection, and it seems like my current router can't handle it. Currently I've got my eyes set on the RB4011 from MicroTik, but I'm not sure if that will be the best choice. 
 I don't have any spare PCs lying around, and the RB4011 seemed to be cheaper than rolling my own solution. However, I wanted to get some second opinions as well as look around and research before I make my purchase. 
 Things I want my router to do:
 - WireGuard
 -DHCP Leasing
 -Basic Firewall rules and NAT
 -As mentioned earlier, Gigabit throughput 
 -Not necessarily dead quiet, but not loud enough to be annoying
 Thanks for any useful information or advice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my current setup, I have a small server (HP Z600) that runs proxmox, and has several VMs running on it including Home Assistant, PiVPN, and Pihole, along with Ubuntu Desktop. I have another PC running my plex server, and yet another pc running truenas with only a couple of disks in it. I also have a 4 disk standalone Buffalo NAS that I've had for a long time. I would like to get a new, more powerful server to be able to consolidate some of these things and expanding my storage capabilities (and/or free up current hardware for tinkering on other projects). Here's what I'd like to use the new server for:
 1) primary NAS for my Plex media with 8-12 drives for storage.
 2) Hypervisor for not only the VMs that I mentioned above, but also for a couple of windows VMs for various things, and maybe even a hackintosh vm.
 3) Run a web server. This can be done on one of the VMs mentioned above though...
 I've had my eye on a Dell r720 with 8 LFF drive bays, 20 cores, 192 GB ram... Would this be a good choice for the things I want to do? If so, what operating system should i consider running? I like proxmox, but how will I use the drives as a NAS (preferably with some redundancy)? I have heard that i'll have to do some advanced stuff to the hardware RAID card if I want to install truenas - plus, I'm not sure that TruNAS as the os would let me do all the VM stuff I want to do. I'd love some advice on how to make this work. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been trying for several weeks now to utilize Wireguard with no luck. I set it up, what I believe to be correctly in docker, and when I turn on the VPN, I cannot load anything through the connection. 
 I recently have tried to use wg-easy with similar results. I connect to the VPN but cannot load anything.
 Where should I start to try and get this working? Could there be an issue with router settings that would be blocking something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to do a complete manual install of zabbix from source. Not looking for a script. I was using the arch aur but it failed me and it was not missing some features. I got the whole complete package placed, the database working with the db templates imported. I was able to setup the front end working with nginx. But i could not find any explicit instructions to manual create the service for the server or agent to get the ball rolling. 
 I already looked at the zabbix manual. Not enough detailed info about the services and creating the systemctl files. Any one mind pointing my into the right direction.
 I will be retrying the aur to extract any info about the services i need.
 Please and thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently using my 2 x 16Tb disk in RAID1 setup build on Synology 918. I'm looking for expansion options. I have considered so far following: - adding new 16Tb drive and building RAID5 - adding new 16Tb drive on side as standalone - adding 2 x new 4Tb in RAID1 and building RAID0 2x16Tb - adding 2 x new 4Tb in RAID1 and leaving 2 x 16Tb each standalone
 My critical data (documents, photos etc) are around 3Tb in size, currently placed on 16Tb volume together with some unnecessary data like movies, TV shows, ISO data store for ESXi etc. 
 I'm slowly increasing critical data, but the non critical one is growing really fast.
 In first option, I will have one volume, but with RAID5. Considering my critical data is being backed up to USB, I could take risk of potential rebuild of 32Tb volume, but still it's RAID5. In last option, my critical data would move to separate volume, while non critical data could spin on standalone 2x16Tb drives.
 Which would you recommend to me? Is that RAID5 really a risk if the critical data is backed up? I'm also worried about speed in RAID5, but maybe nvme cache is an option?
 Guys please advise, as I'm bit lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using WD Easystore 14TB HDs USB connected to my laptop for over a year. Plex works swimmingly and I've never had any issues. Recently I decided I wanted a bit more of a legit setup and am tired of the USB clutter and WD enclosures. I plan to shuck these and use them in the new server (aware of the white label drive's pin, etc).
 I am lazy and not a hardware techy, so I bought this previously owned server from someone. Here's the description:
 "Built this to run my plex server using unraid. have upgraded my system. No harddrives included. This holds 5 harddrives. Small and compact. Asrock H97M -ITX/AC motherboard Intel i5 -4590 Processor Crucial Balistic 16GB Ram Corsair CX500M Power Supply Lian Li - PC-Q25 Case 2 Noctua Fan Case" 
 I do NOT plan to use UNRAID or TRUEnas. I will use Windows and this thing will be a Plex server exclusively.
 Here's the images of it: https://ibb.co/jbsD83r https://ibb.co/09pTdcy https://ibb.co/3S0st6M https://ibb.co/YWrs2Jk https://ibb.co/J5jZNcw
 So my questions are:
  
How plug and play ready is this once I put my HDs in? 
 Can I use this with my existing laptop? 
 What are things I must know besides the obvious Plex oriented things?
 Advice??
  
Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m hoping that this is the correct community to ask in, but if I’m in tht wrong place I apologize in advance 
 I need to drastically increase the storage on my home network and also want to add redundancy. 
 I was looking at older Drobo models, which looked fantastic. I like the idea of a NAS that just uses the available disk space without needing have all the drives match exactly. I’ve read that Linux support is lacking, though. Ext3 is fine, but ext4 isn’t, apparently. 
 I also appreciate that they come with USB and network connectivity. That way you don’t have to decide whether it’ll be connected directly to a server or hosted on the network. 
 Can anyone suggest another consumer grade enclosure or NaS that’s comparable? USB and Ethernet, with support for mix and match drives, And is compatible with ext4?
 A while ago, I found a Linux application that could do the mismatched drives, but forgot the name. But because it could only be used as network storage it didn’t seem compelling 
 My reading about synologies indicates that they need identical sized drives, so that nixes them. 
 What else is out there? Any suggestions appreciated!

Provide full-text search for documents that contain text
 Provide metadata search/filtering on all documents
 (bonus) Provide OCR capabilities for PDFs/Images
  
The kicker is that I want my folder structure to continue being a disorganized mess. All I want to do is point the the thing at the root directory of the share, and have it make the files searchable.
 Is there anything that can do this?
 I searched everywhere for this, and the common suggestion is Paperless-ngx. Paperless seems like a good solution, but it insists on reorganizing everything into it's own folder structure. It sounds like they do this to avoid checking document hashes on each crawl, but none the less.
 I also heard Ambar suggested, but it looks like it's now abandonware.

I see bits and peices of what I need here but no clear answer. What is the easists way to get https working on a LOCAL web server with NO internet dependence??? I see references to nginx, lets encrypt, and some other tools. But all of the solutions I read into, so far, had some kind of internet dependence. Others have browser issues. Has anyone gone down this road and found a solution that they really like??? I am not a complete newb, but the last time I did this, I was creating my own certs in a local tool for vm's. I am not sure that works with current browsers based on what I am reading. TIA!!!

 I have a home desktop running Windows 10. One SSD to run Windows, assorted programs, and a Linux virtual machine, and three HDDs full of personal data. I'm backing up to an external WD Elements HDD.
 I'd like to have a image backup of my SSD without the Linux VM, another image backup of just the VM, and a file level backup of my multiple data drives.
 A couple other questions:
 If I run incremental backups can I eventually consolidate those files on the backup drive and be able to compare the consolidated full backup files against my local files?
 Final question for anyone patient and kind enough to still be reading this, if I rename local files on my local data drives and reorganize their folders, would a file level backup program end up making duplicates or be able to track the name/folder changes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think I can sum up my cloud storage needs with two 2 points...
 1. I don't want continuous backup, I want to do it manually.
 I don't have enough changing data on my desktop to need any sort of continuous backup. The data I'm looking to backup is mainly just 1) decades of old photos, videos, documents that aren't ever being changed/updated, 2) a handful of documents I update from time to time (e.g. weekly, monthly), and 3) new documents that show up infrequently and don't get updated after that (e.g. yearly tax documents).
 So, I basically just have a bunch of stuff I'd like to manually upload somewhere and store as a backup (in addition to the external drive I already do this with), and then I'd like to manually upload some additional stuff or an updated version of a file that's already being stored on occasion.
 2. I do want zero-knowledge encryption. 
 For all the usual security/privacy reasons.
 What would be the best option(s) for this purpose? 
 Thanks in advance for any advice.

Is there any solution that can help with the organisation and playback of these types of media? I don't mind manually adding everything to it, just a nicer way to organise them and play them back
 Courses I could probably handle with Jellyfin, but it'd be cool if there was something else designed specifically for them, especially as many courses are both videos and text based

 I found a good deal on a second hand corsair 900d and thinking of getting it. But I may need additional drive cages later on. Since it is a pretty old case, I think it is impossible to get it from corsair or find it online.
 How compatible are drive cages from other cases would be with this one? Or would it be possible to get it 3d printed? I don't care for the looks, I just would like to be able to add more drive cages when I need it.
 This will be my first time building a pc so, sorry if it is a stupid question
 Also if you have other comments on the case itself, please share

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 trying to spool up my own instance of anonaddy. I was able to get it running, but am having trouble sending and receiving mail through it. Here is the run down.
 - Port 25 is enabled through my ISP and port forwarded on my router to my servers IP using TCP.
 - I setup some DNS records through my cloudflare. See redacted screen shot:
 DKIM is using selector in compose file and p value is the public key generated by anonaddy
 - MXtoolbox shows all good signs using several checks, no syntax errors or heavy mistakes.
 - Redacted Docker-compose as follows: 
 APP_KEY & ANONADDY_SECRET use different long string values. POSTFIX_RELAYHOST is using my ISP's relay server.
 - I do not have a static IP and cannot get one because of limitations of my ISP (I think). Also, I do not think I can alter reverse DNS info either. Help needed here if possible.
 - I get logs (redacted) as follows when the server tries to send email verification:
  mail postfix/smtp[1022]: to=<mypersonalgmail@gmail.com>, relay=POSTFIX_RELATHOST VALUE[00.00.00.0]:25, delay=2, delays=0.11/0.03/1.2/0.63, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 <> Mail accepted) 
 - My initial guess is that I am getting filtered my other mail servers for reverse DNS reasons and do not want to push it too hard and end up on some ban list. 
 - check.spamhaus.org stated that my ISP blocks port 25 and that I should use a relay which they provided (currently this is my POSTFIX_RELAYHOST value) 
 I feel like I am so close. If someone could shine some light or just let me know if this is impossible to setup with my ISP. At least I could get some closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had a couple second hand servers and have been tinkering with them for quite a few months, but now I want to set them up in a more “professional” way (basically not having a messy chaos as I have right now). What would be ideal for me:
  
Production node: this node will be hosting the VMs and containers I want to be HA, and that can’t afford to be down/broken if I screw up (Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Nginx, AdGuard, etc.).
 Tinkering node: a node fully used for testing and trying stuff (VMs, Docker, OSs, etc.)
 Storage node: a node used only for storage for the other two nodes (probably iSCSI). The other nodes will have just two mirrored SSDs for booting, and maybe another two for latency-sensible VMs in the production node.
  
My goals: - Scalability: having storage-oriented and performance-oriented nodes makes the setup more flexible when trying to upgrade the cluster. - Flexibility: being able to move VMs between nodes without much hassle is KEY for me. Having the ability to move VMs from the servers to a PC Hypervisor and viceversa would also be ideal, but I understand that this is more complicated to achieve. - Ease of use: managing everything through a single interface would be much appreciated. Also being able to run Docker directly on the Hypervisor would be great. An easy to use offsite backup solution is also important.
 For the moment I have just used Proxmox (independent nodes, not clustering), and while the experience has been mostly great, it lacks some features, being Docker the most important one. I wanted to know what you guys are using and what is your experience. Thanks in advance!

 I'm currently using Fedora Server with docker containers, and I was wondering if any of you are using Fedora IoT (based on RPM-ostree) with Podman since it is "marketed" as the future of servers. More generally, I would like to know what are the tools (like Nix, snap, ...) you are using and/or plan/want to use and WHY. 
 I have a bit of free time right now, and I might spend it trying out new tools just for fun.
 Thx and happy holidays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around this time of year, I start to get itchy fingers and need a project to kill a day or so, off i went researching and have now pfsense running 10Gb, totally overkill yes but hey ho
 Spec: i5-7500T 16Gb 512GB nvme 10Gb Mellanox ConnectX-3 MCX312A-XCBT 1x 10Gb DAC 1x 10GBASE-T SFP+ RJ45 Transceiver Module (FS.com SFP-10G-T) 3x Zyxel XGS1210-12 around the house
 ISP - 1Gb Virgin Media UK - SH5 in Modem mode using 2.5GBe port.
 Running proxmox just for the hell of it, the machine runs at 15W-17W idle which is pretty good for 10Gb card and 10GBASE-T module as they run quite power heavy. 
 I may setup another pihole for HA but will have to see, got to make most of proxmox!
 Currently running Cat5e and Cat6 around the house so using the 2.5Gb switch ports for some runs, this works quite well, my Unraid server has a 2.5Gbe onboard and iperf from pfsense to it maxes out the 2.5gbe, im also taking advantage of the over-provisioning Virgin do with the speeds.
 Next is to grab a 10Gbe card for Unraid and see if I can get away with running anything up to 10Gb over Cat6
 This all replaced a HP T730 with 4x Intel Nic card
 All good fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: a natural language search engine for personal data archives .
 Iv'e pulling a lot of old stuff from my archive lately, the thing is, the HDD (10tb seagate) is way too slow for searching in realtime, more over, I can't actually search with natural language so to find what I'm looking for I need to try a couple of searches.
 That's why I decided to build haystack, a search engine for data, meant for finding technical details or relevant paragraphs..
 It enables you to search large HDDs or slack, confluence, email all in one place.
 no internet connection required.
 It supports natural language queries so a query like: "where was I last spring?"yields:
 4 documents, 3 photos, and two emails 
 haystack stores user data locally, so there's no security risk - only you have access to internal docs, I didn't want to deal with security compliance headaches caused from storing user data in the cloud.
 Rolled it out to my co-workers and friends a week ago and they thought it's a hit, and also less bugging, so I'm planning on releasing it publicly on March 2023.
 Early access
 If you want to try it out before March 2023 - Early access
 or Github
 Thanks, Yuval

 Highlights
  
Suitable for deployment on low configuration servers.
 Simple and practical.
 Diosic can categorize subfolders in your music folder. For example, if there are English, Chinese
  
, Japanese subfolders under your music folder, they will be automatically classified into three lists. This is also my original intention to develop Diosic.
 I'm new to Rust. Thank You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Im using Office 365 Business in the moment for 5€/month.
 However, as I switched to self-hosting von Calender/Contacts/Files, it seems not to be the ideal solution anymore (especially privacy).
 So I'm thinking to get a Protonmail Premium Subscription (2 years for 7,19€ per month).
 I will use my own domain, so it's not about anonymity, I just want my mails be stored encrypted so that not even the provider can access it.
 Protonmail is using a bridge (for Linux, PC, Mac) to encrypt the mails and server a local IMAP server via 127.0.0.1.
 However, as it's binding to 127.0.0.1, you would need to install it on every device, and it's not possible on smartphones.
 Because of this, I want to create a virtual machine so that I can reach the local IMAP server via VPN also on my smartphones.
 How can I open the localhost IMAP-port to my local network? Maybe NGINX is a solution? 
 And besides of this: Do you think switching from Outlook to Protonmail is a good decision?
 Is their infrastructure safe enough and is it ensured they will exist the full 2 years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Homelab Community!
 I've been enjoying this subreddit for some time now, while trying to figure out how to set up my own home network/lab. Based on what I've learnt here (and elsewhere), I have a plan. But I would love to get some feedback from the community.
 Motivation: Update my home network from my 10 year old router running OpenWRT to something more performent, secure, and future proof. Also to learn about networking and have some fun.
 Background: I don't work in tech, but I do programming for work (data science) and I have some basic knowledge when it comes to hardware. However, networking is pretty new to me; the most advanced thing I've done is to flash OpenWRT on my router and set up some VLANs (I also had some home automation stuff on a RasperryPi many years back).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a VPS with an encrypted virtual drive and RSA key-pair authentification.
 Technically speaking, can my provider somehow login to my VPS (by changing the rsa key for example or something) and therefore have access to my data ?
 EDIT : More info about my setup :
 Password authentification is disabled, I only use keys to login with SSH.When creating the VPS I generated the keys on my local computer and only gave my provider the public key.Cloud-init is disabled and I'm running vanilla Ubuntu server.I never used web console to login.
 EDIT 2 : I came to the conclusion it's nearly impossible to prevent them from reading my data.
 1 - They can get my password from the RAM
 2 - The data is decrypted when the system is running anyway. 
 I guess the only way to prevent them is to encrypt my data on my local machine before uploading it.
 Thank you all, I learned so much from your answers.
 Thanks

 I don't understand why the drives are spinning down. I've used hdparm to set the -B value to 255 but it gets reset to 20 after a while. I set it in a udev rule so its set at boot up, but again, after a while, it's back at 20.
 I don't have TLP or any other power management script/tool that I know of. The logs don't show anything interesting. I've tried searching but there's not a lot of info about not wanting the drives to sleep, usually it's the opposite.
 I've tried setitng -S 0 along with -B 255 with hdparm. I updated /etc/hdparm.conf to set the APM value to 255 for each of my spinning drives. 
 Is there something else I'm missing that is changing the APM value of the drives?

My main concern is that many applications seem to just prefer to only use LDAP. As a systems administrator in my day job, I have plenty of experience with Windows Server and Active Directory on there, but I'm keen to not use Windows at home for such purpose
 So naturally, there's OpenLDAP and Samba AD, neither of which I've ever used (save for Samba for my NAS). Then there's these big and complex solutions like Authentik and Keycloak, but I'm not sure either of these have their own LDAP solution, and just sync from an existing LDAP server

 So when one of the big problems I have with western comic books in comparison to manga is that I just don't know where to start. I'd like to read the in universe collection I just don't know how to.
 And this is where this reading order comes in.
 https://comicbookreadingorders.com/
 I've compiled the entire list in several cbz for a more seamless experience. 
 I have done marvel master reading order part 1-10,Marvel Now, all new all different marvel, Marvel Legacy, A Fresh Start.
 and for Dc master reading order part 1-7, The new 52, DC you, rebirth.
 Marvel's has many more comics and is monstrously larger than DC. 
 I don't want you guys to think that I'm asking to archive it for me to use later. I have my own digital archive. I am keeping it careful. But i thought I should mention it for the comic book fans that are interested.
 Its on Torrentgalaxy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 This sub has helped me a great deal with backing up my work, so I thought I’d ask a question here. I often make huge backups overnight. As I’m fairly clumsy, I’ll occasionally knock a wire or something, and the process will be interrupted. In todays instance, I knocked the off button in my new hard drive enclosure. I had some errors on screen (“unable to move movie.mp4”) but turning it back on again, I could click “try again” and the process resumed as before. My question is, will it be corrupted, or will windows simply move the whole file from the start again? I can always check the files are the same size after the move perhaps, just to check. Should I be worried? Would I need to start the process over?
 Thanks, Harry

 I recently got myself an R310 and I need to find some rails that work with a 36" rack. I bought some rails for the R310, but they fall a bit short of the end of my rack, so I can't use those. I'm struggling to find any ReadyRails that will fit the R310 and a 36" rack, and I don't want to resort to using universal rails unless I have to. Does anyone know of the part number for rails that would suit my needs?

 But don't really know what NIC to get, I got an NAS which is being used at least a couple of hours a day for large files. So 2,5 or 10 would be better in my eyes. Also in the market for a new switch so 2.5 and 10 are an option.
 Currently looking at the following 3 NICS, but open for suggestions;
 HP Ethernet 10Gb 2-port 561FLR-T
 HP FlexFabric 10Gb 2-port 533FLR-T
 Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual or Quad 
 The reason for those NICS, is that I can buy them second hand here in Europe for under 50 euros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I recently got a cheap (280€) Dual Xeon Silver 4110 based Supermicro Server with 128GB RAM on eBay.
 The system itself works just fine however the CPUs are too slow for the intended purpose as a virtualization server. 
 I'm now unsure whether it's worth upgrading the CPUs to some Xeon Gold Chips as most of them are priced at 250-300€ per CPU on eBay. 
 At around 600€ I can already buy a similar performing second-hand AMD EPYC-based CPU including a new motherboard. 
 As electricity is getting super expensive (59ct per kWh in Germany) I have to consider the power consumption as well. 
 I'd love to hear your advice as I'm not sure if it's worth spending more money on the Intel Scalable platform or just leaving the system as it is and maybe using it for something else. 
 I'd also have to upgrade the RAM, It currently has 8*16 2666MHz sticks, can I mix it with a few 32GB or even 64GB sticks with the same speed? 
 Thanks!

 So I'm very new to homeservers. I'm currently running Nextcloud and some projects on a Raspberry Pi 4B with an external ssd. I've been looking into a NAS for a while now and wish to learn and experiment a bit more with a homelab / NAS server.
 What I want to do:
  
Run proxmox as a host OS, deploy different VM's/containers for services like Nextcloud, HA, Jellyfin, TrueNAS. At the moment I don't need too much storage, I would like to be able to expand in the future. 
  
​
 What I've been looking to get:
 ​
  
 CPU AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (AWOF Boxed) Hexa Core, ECC support € 89,90 
  
 MB ASRock fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/ac € 114,90 
  M.2 NVE SSD WD PC SN730 (SED) 256GB (for OS) € 39,99 
  RAM 2x 16GB KINGSTON KSM26ED8/16HD (ECC support) € 60,03 each, € 120,06 total 
  CASE Fractal Design Node 304 € 91,00 
  HDD 2x Seagate IronWolf NAS HDD, 4TB € 83,95 each, €167,90 total 
  PSU Cooler Master V550 SFX Gold € 63,61 
   Total € 687,21 
 
 Is this a solid start or do you have any other recommendations? Also energy out here is not cheap at all. I'm currently paying around € 0,70/kWh here, so it would be nice to keep this low..

 The real Question/Problem is VMs in TrueNas. Does anybody know what’s best practice for doing VM Backups in TrueNas Scale?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I purchased a Terramaster D3-400 a few months ago so that I could set up a home server with a ZFS pool. I put four Toshiba N300 4TB drives in the box and set it up with TrueNAS on an Intel NUC. It works pretty well except the disk drives spun constantly: they never went to sleep.
 It wasn't the fastest thing on two feet though, so I decided: let's just use it as it was intended, a direct attach storage device. I hook it up to my Windows 11 laptop, and... it seems to power off randomly. In order to bring the device back up I have to unplug the DAS and then it can be recognized by the OS again. This morning I tried writing about half a terabyte to it and it turned itself off after a few dozen gig.
 I am not 100% sure I trust this thing. I know it was a bargain, many of the reviews were positive, but I'm not putting my life's work on it in the meantime.
 Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any way to spin down the disks or keep the box awake?

These 2 computers are plugged into our provided combo router/modem provided by our ISP (it doesn’t have any other ports sadly)
 While acquiring or building a NAS sounds fun in a geeky way, I am looking into the best value option to handle this task, even if it mean using built-in Windows features.

However, both of them make this weird periodic thumping sound when they are running. I do not know if this is a normal behaviour of the drives, or I am just unlucky enough to have two defective drives. When I touch the drive, it feels like very gentle baby kicks. I have already zero-filled the drive to check if there's anything wrong, but nothing seems to stand out in SMART tests. Should I be concerned? I can send audio samples of what it sounds like, if it helps.

 I'm not finding anything in the discussions on their GitHub page and it doesn't seem like a particularly active community.

So, I switched to the tmobile home internet and get 300mbps for an amazing deal of free for the next 5 months then 25/month after that. The only problem is I can't pass traffic to my synology as it does not have nat. They claim it's a IPV6 problem. I researched into different products and found Packetriot. They are using a external server and having a tunnel between it and whatever you install it on. Well, I have an external server in a free oracle instance, arm processor. So, Could I use the oracle box, and have my synology nas tunnel into it? What software would I need on both ends? Anyone done anything like this before?
 ​
 Update: I have tailscale up and running. My desktop and my cloud are talking and I am able to pass traffic between the two. Now, i need to figure out how to have a external domain name pass through the tailscale to the synology. Will update with more information.

 BlueIris had choppy video playback for me, possibly due to transcoding caused by no direct write in the demo version.
 Shinobi mobile app sucks badly
 iSpy works well, but monthly subscription for mobile access is dumb.
 xProtect works great, but mobile app has no direct streaming in the free version, and the transcoding causes stuttering playback.
 Luxriot is no longer free
 Frigate looks a bit more in depth then I need.
 Only other real option is zoneminder?

However, this will likely not always be the case, and I'd like to archive about as much of the academic literature as possible (particularly relevant to my work, but also in some other fields of interest).

 I use Zotero on an unlimited storage plan and have ~4.5 TB of total available open space (working on filling this!). Papers don't take up that much space at all; the limiting factor is my own throughput. It'd be great to find an automated workflow so as to download & organize papers. My access to journals is generally mediated through EZProxy, but this is avoidable on local WiFi. Does anyone have experience with the Zotero API and/or EZProxy to do this (or similar tools)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Was just lurking here, thats my first post - Maybe the worst or easiest question of the year but i have to try. Kinda new to docker, portainer and doing some practises.
 I have 2 container on my portainer, which want to use port 8080 redirected to 80.
 The first One works, the second one (of course?) not. Whats the easiest way to change that ports for the second container? Is that a thing in the image, or @portainer? 
 I tried the portainer option for ports redirect in the container deployment like 8181 -->> 8080 but that doesnt work for me.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently using an old desktop PC (i5-3570k) as a simple home server with Ubuntu and ZFS. The only purpose of the server is to archive a bunch of data that I rarely access and to act as a Time Machine (macOS backup) target. For this reason, it spends 90% of its time suspended.
 My problem is that the server is in the hall together with my home router, but I have no way to connect to it through Ethernet from my PC in my bedroom, so I have to use Wi-Fi and this causes the Time Machine backups to be unbearably slow.
 I thought about 2 possible "solutions":
  
Move the server in my bedroom, in order to connect it to my laptop via Ethernet to make things faster and to reduce latency. This would also mean having to connect to the AP via Wi-Fi (i.e. much slower and less reliable Internet access).
 Remove everything from the case apart from the PSU and the disks and turn the PC into a poor man's USB DAS (located in my bedroom). This would mean higher speed and lower power consumption.
  
For my current situation, it looks like solution 2 is the better deal. A NAS is certainly more flexible, but right now I only use a single PC and I don't see that changing in the near future.
 What do you guys think? Am I missing anything / are there other smarter solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if I missed this feature before, but it seems Standard Notes has a feature for uploading files now: https://docs.standardnotes.com/self-hosting/file-uploads
 I'm failing to understand how that works. I'm failing to understand the security requirements for that as the documentation I linked to is way too vague.
 Do I have to create a reverse proxy to that port, which defaults to 3125? Or is it secure by default?
 The docs say the api_gateway won't be used. But then in docker-compose I see that the api_gateway uses the variable FILES_SERVER_URL... why? What is it used for? And how does that relate to EXPOSED_FILES_PORT? Do I just have to set EXPOSED_FILES_PORT considering I'm using docker, and forget about the URL and let tcp forwarding do its magic? Well, then more questions pop up.
 How does Standard Notes know where to send the file requests? How does standard notes know whether they're proxied with a reverse-proxy to decide on the communication protocol? Does it try both http and https? If there's no reverse proxy, how is the end-to-end encryption done? Where's the encryption key?
 Way too many questions in my head about this thing... I'd really appreciate explaining anything you can about this. Especially how you set this up.
 Also, one more bonus thing, can I store the files in the database instead of in a separate file-storage? That'd be really nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I've been lurking here for a while now and I've started going down the rabbit hole of self hosting.
 I'm currently running a RPi4 with 3xHDDs that previously was just managing backups, handling remote torrenting (DelugeD), and hosting an Emby server (recently switched to Jellyfin). 
 I've recently added a few other things to the mix (Navidrome, Audiobookshelf, Changedetection.io) and I'm wanting to go further (Photoprism, which seemed too heavy for the Pi when I tried it out, RSS, etc.) I'm thinking I should probably move a lot of this to another machine. I've got an old (c. 2015?) Gateway desktop with Linux Mint Mate installed and I'm wondering if this machine either sounds good as is, could use some upgrades, or even shouldn't be used as a long-term solution.
 Motherboard: Acer IPISB-VR Rev 1.01 (Supports Intel (Socket Type – LGA 1155): Core i7 (Quad Core), Core i5, Core i3)
 CPU: 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 2300 Quad Core
 RAM: 8GB DDR3 (16GB Max)
 GPU: GeForce GTX 950
 PSU: EVGA 700B
 1.5TB HDD
 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet
 I've been thinking it could use some new thermal paste (the fans go wild and temps have random spikes), maybe a $20 upgrade to 16GB RAM, and maybe even a CPU upgrade of some sort.
 Thoughts and suggestions appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 This sub has been very good to me giving me advice for my first server build. Well I am back and in true DataHorder style, I'm out of space on that server so I'm in the process of planning my new NAS/Server and need your advice again.
 My current setup:
  
Its is a custom built Hyper-V server with a big storage pool and a few VMs on it (including Plex).
 The pool is a triple mirror pool with about 45TB effective capacity.
 VMs run Centos (in case that matters).
  
What I'm looking for:
  
~200TB effective storage
 2 disk redundancy (meaning I can lose 2 disks and not loose the pool). I am open to a 'raid-6' config or similar for efficiency.
 don't need a lot of horsepower here to run VMs as that is and will be handled on my existing server.
 Minimum- Storage needs to be fast enough to stream 4K HDR movies (about 200Mbps) but ideally would like it to be able to handle gigabit read and writes.
  
Option 1: Buy a NAS
  
I was considering buying a Synology 12 bay unit and filling it with (12) 20TB Exos drives but know they made a change recently where their NAS's only support their Synology branded drives and these 20TB drives wouldn't fit that. Not sure how advisable it is to run non-supported drives on these units. Also not sure if I would bump up against the Maximum Volume size. I think I would need the DS3622XS+ due to said limit.
 I'm also open to other manufacturers if you have one to recommend.
  
Option 2: Build a NAS
  
The other option is to build my own. Admittedly I will need some help with this specifically with software and hardware recommendations. I'm not sure how much hardware horsepower ill need to handle this much storage. With regard to software, what's the preferred choice for a pool of this size?
  
I am very open to any info or feedback that you have and am happy to provide any more details.
 Thanks in advance!
 JM

Today i decided to make a cloudflare tunnel (say what you will its works the best for me) and all went well until i set a password once i do that i am able to login no problem using my local ip but from my domain even if i type the right password it just gives me the prompt again. Sometimes it loads the main page but not fully. I tried multiple accounts and made sure that the box for allowing public access t o front is checked. What should i do the fact that on my local ip works is weird, any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 TL.DR: I'm looking for a self-hosted media library solution that is able to catalog various media. Serving media is not a requirement.
 What I actually mean with that, I have movies that I've ripped from Blu-Rays, Blu-Rays themselves, DVDs, Audio CDs and a lot other media that I'd like to catalog to basically just see what movies or music I have and on what media. Ideally it would also go over my collection, recognise it and download metadata, like album art, release date, etc.
 I've already looked at Jellyfin and other media servers, but neither of them were the one (I'm not looking at Plex for various reasons). I've found a macOS app, Movie Explorer (https://betamagic.nl/products/movieexplorer.html) that would be perfect, but it's a macOS app and it can only be used by one person. I'd prefer something with a web GUI where users (family members) can enter and/or look up data. I'm not looking for a solution that would also stream it (though it's a nice-to-have, I already have a solution for that), just pure cataloging is enough to get started.
 Can anyone point me to the right direction?
 Thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a tool similar to what Tautulli does for Plex, but for TVHeadend. I know not many of you are self hosting an instance of TVHeadend, but for those who are, I want to share it.
 For now its somewhat limited, it just displays top stats for some categories, and a history, but it does work pretty stable.
 I plan on adding charts and stuff when I have some spare time.
 It is written in elixir and of course, it's free and open source. I have some docker images ready, so it's easy to get it running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company provides a hosted SaaS product that our customers use to create web pages - actually much more involved than that but irrelevant for the purposes of this. The problem is that often clients want to include images or PDFs in the pages or as links on the pages which is not a problem but I've resisted allowing clients to upload all of this stuff to our servers for a variety of reasons - partly because I know they'd never get cleaned up but also because our application runs in a docker container and with a set of ansible scripts I can build a server with a very complex setup from a vanilla OS to fully deployed in around 8 minutes so if I did provide a way for clients to upload files then it would have to be stored in our database layer rather than in the file system so that it doesn't matter which server the request goes to. Currently, we tell the clients to upload images to any image hosting service and to use a public link but I would like to improve our offering without putting the burden into our SaaS application. There';s nothing sensitive or that needs to not be publicly accessible other than not serving a directory listing.
 I started looking at nextcloud the other day just out of interest and that made me wonder if there is something with a web interface where I can allow clients to upload their own files to a web server but with a single domain for all files on the server with each client being seen as a subdirectory so I can get away without having to manage multiple certificates for https.
 I realise it's a very specific question and that there may not be anything that'll do what I want but I'm wondering if anyone knows of something before I start looking at building our own solution?
 TIA

 However when I point Picard at it and try to tag tracks, Picard's Authentication dialogue pops up. The self-hosted server tells me it can't provide an authentication code for Picard, and codes generated by the musicbrainz.org site don't work.
 Has anyone got this working? It sounds like an obvious use case for the self-hosted server and I have 70,000 tracks I'd like to tag!
 EDIT - I've got it working - it's because I was logged into my musicbrainz.org account in Picard and didn't log out before changing the server address to my local IP.
 EDIT 2 - I used the Installation instructions for Metabrainz's own musicbrainz-docker github repo to get this working, rather than Linuxserver.io's image (which I've never been successful with!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So folks, I'm the designated "IT" person in the family. And my google-fu is weak on this one. 
 This family member has them in 2 OWC enclosures that houses 2x20TB drives each. I only have access to their macbook and the connection will be via thunderbolt.
 So far, I've done the badblocks route for 50% of the drives, only to learn that I cannot run the remaining 50% of the drive because the end block value exceeds the 32bit integer. I've also tried to do my homework and now understand that changing the -b argument of badblocks to exceed the 4096 block size will render the badblocks result questionable. So silly me for not researching too much into it before running badblocks on all four drives simultaneously (the first 50% for all four drives passed without any incident).
 So, my questions is, how can I at test the remaining 50% or what are some other tests that are available to me that does not involve spending $$$ for paid solutions? 
 I saw a passing comment about encrypting the drive fully via Disk Utility and then checking the SMART status. Is this a viable approach to checking the drives? This family member just wants to know that the drives will not die prematurely. I, personally, think that the drives will be fine, but these drives will be used to store their livelihood, so I understand where they are coming from.
 Any input anyone can provide would be great. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, today I attempted to host my own minecraft server on my router so I wouldn't have to pay for one as I was under the asssumption this would be easy. It was not.
 What is strange is that I was able to connect 1 time with no issues and then never again.
 When I attempt to connect with my public IP address I get the error "Connection timed out: no further information."
 When I attempt to connect with "localhost" I get the error "Connection refused: no further information"
 To my knowledge have set up my port forwarding properly with the proper IPv4 address, type (TCP/UDP) and start & end port.
 I have the most updated versions of Java
 I have enabled the setting “Enable the operating system’s restricted environment” in the Java Control Panel Advanced Settings
 I have changed my network settings
 I tried a network reset
 I restarted my computer & router many times
 I have allowed Java through my firewall (I even attempted to connect with Windows Defender disabled and it still didn't work)
 I feel as if I could have possibly made a mistake when port forwarding as I do not have much knowledge on the subject but I am pretty confident that I set it up correctly.
 Please let me know if there is a possible solution. Thank you.

 Now I'm considering putting a 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVME drive into the second available NVME slot I have on the motherboard, and doing a fresh Window install on it, after which I'll move what little important data I have onto it from the 1TB NVME and then format that drive.
 At this point I'll have the 2TB boot drive, plus the 1TB NVME and 2TB HDD used as data overflow of sorts. I'd like to go ahead and get those later two drives combined into one volume for ease of use, and I'm wondering what's the best "cheap-to-free" way to go about this.
 I'm using a AMD CPU and motherboard, so I have their StoreMI software available to me, plus Windows own "storage spaces" solution built into the OS.
 Has anyone done any sort of comparison between these two options to see which performs better? I'm not looking for any sort of nitty-gritty numbers but I figure I may as well lean into whichever works better.
 Thanks.
 Late Edit: OR should I just scrap the ol' spinner entirely and just use the two NVME drives manually?

 I have a full depth rack (1m) but I can adjust the mounting depth. For now I put the router mid rack, but even so, a lot of cables don't come close so I can't mount a patch panel at the same depth.
 I could mount the panel at the back of the rack and use long patch cables. Alternatively, I could cut the wires (I already terminated them) and extend them with a shielded cat6a junction box. 
 What do you suggest as the best approach? 
 Attached is a picture of the current mess I'm trying to tidy up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gday all. It’s time for a rebuild of things, so I thought I’d sit down and hammer this all out, and started questioning the path forward. Wanted to know your suggestions, and thoughts on it.
 Up until now, things have been a mix of HyperV, which I want to move away from, and into Proxmox. Proxmox has been great for me, but sometimes doesn’t feel like the right fit for me. I generally run about 6-8 little servers, and feel like im pounding my head against the wall setting up LXC containers or even full out VM’s and compiling or installing programs from scratch when there is a docker/podman alternative sitting there waiting for me.
 I started playing a bit with the Turnkey machines in Proxmox, and while it worked, there seemed to be some issues with a few of the images, and googling around, others have some full on hate for them, so maybe thats not where I want to spend my time either.
 So I go back to maybe I should dabble (never have) in Docker or Podman. Ok…but in that case, I will need to manage a base OS. What does everyone do here? One comment I saw was running Proxmox, and then a VM inside that runs Docker…which just seems weird to me, but maybe thats ok?
 Where should I spend my time learning here? Open to suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm currently trying to part out a homelab from scratch (current set up is no more than a 2012 dell with some more ram and a few extra drives in it) and I was hoping for some tips and pointers from those who have treaded this path before. I will add that I’m no stranger to parting out and building gaming computers, but I’ve never touched anything like this outside of finding a new use for my old Dell XPS 8700.
 I've recently finished my undergrad and I’m currently residing in London, so cost and space are a premium. I’m thinking a sub-ATX motherboard that I can readily source from the used market. 
 The most demanding thing it will be doing is hosting VM’s and serving as a rendering box and so I’m more than happy to use a platform that’s a few generations old.
 Right off the bat I’m not sure if I should go with a consumer/pro-summer/server motherboard. I know you can get retired server and workstation gear for cheap on the used market but I worry that must be folly for my application.
 Professional features like remote management would be a ‘nice to have’ but not at all necessary for my application. 
 In regards to RAM, I have heard ECC memory is either 'a nice to have' or ‘damn right crucial’ for ZFS depending where I ask, and so some advice on memory type would be greatly appreciated.
 Besides that, if people could post what CPUs and cases they run for a budget and space friendly set up that would be greatly appreciated. I’ll post a couple that I have bookmarked incase anyone has any experience with them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, does anyone have a script on Windows that can sort the output from 7z l -slt into CRC PATH for each file in the archive? I'd greatly appreciate it if you could share or help make such a script, I don't know much about scripting.
 Example: https://pastebin.com/Wk3HJR3s
 Result:
 11FF11FF D:\test\test\[test]\test\[2021-01-01].7z\folder\1.psd 99D59E9A D:\test\test\[test]\test\[2022-01-01].7z\redlof\redlof2\2.psd 
 Each line should have a CRC value at the start and a space between it and the full path of the file, I want this done for any file in the output.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a self-hosted domain, let's say mydomain.com
 I have port forwarding setup so that I can ssh to mydomain.com
 On the same server hosting that domain is a gitea instance. I want to enable ssh cloning, but I would like it to be on port 22 also so that the clones aren't cluttered with non-standard ports.
 But it looks like when I attempt to clone I get:
 Cloning into 'repo': git@mydomain.com: Permission denied (publickey)
 I have verified that my ssh keys in gitea are correct and valid. I think maybe it's because git clone is just hitting port 22 and that may or may not hit gitea or the native ssh port?
 Is it possible to run both services on port 22 in this way?

 My QUESTION is if I pull my drives from my NAS bays, swap them with my new drives, will I be able to use, say, my usb-to-sata cable to copy the contents of my old drives to the new ones? 
 My worry is that because the disks are spanning, file contents are split amongst all four drives and that copying one drive at a time will result in corruption. I feel I may be confusing spanning with striping, or RAID 0, where data is written to both drives simultaneously; reason why you lose data when one drive fails. 
 The easy answer is to just buy an external HDD I can copy my NAS to, I'd just like to not buy more HDDs (for now).

 I'm hosting all my services in a DigitalOcean droplet for the past three years and was using an $12/month droplet with 1vCPU and 2GB RAM. However lately I tried to add new self hosted stuff to my stack and the I need more memory.
 I tried to upgrade to 2vCPU 4GB RAM instances and they cost $24-28/month.
 My questions is, do you use these cloud VPS providers, if so, which ones do you recommend? I'd love to host the services in my machine, but this is too convenient for me for the time being, but rather costly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current score: Brian -4, OCI +1000.
 I spun up a new tenancy in OCI with a single host in the free tier (Ampere 4 CPU, 24GB RAM) to host a mail server for my domain. I have no problem configuring my own DNS records via Cloudflare. It was working just fine with Vultr, but I wanted to try OCI and hey, it's free. With Vultr I was able to configure my reverse PTR record for my external IP (Vultr owned) in my dashboard. It worked great.
 With OCI I submitted a limits request to get TCP/25 inbound unblocked. No problem. Now I need to submit a support request to get a PTR record configured for my OCI owned external IP and I'm hitting nothing but assholes and brick walls. I've tried to submit my support request via the OCI portal about a million times. It tells me I have to provision my support account. Entering my information in that screen tells me that I need to go to support.oracle.com to submit a request for my account admin to authorize my account to submit a ticket. It provides me with my Customer Support ID that I need to provide as well. When I go to support.oracle.com to submit that request to myself it won't accept my CSI that was provided to me by the cloud portal. (The same number found under the tenancy details) The error says my CSI is not valid or doesn't allow registration.
 I've called support for help, one person told me that I need to talk to sales. Another person told me that my support account hasn't been provisioned yet. I left a message for sales who just got back to me telling me to talk to my sales rep. I don't have a sales rep. I don't need guidance on finding my CSI. I just need a human being to pay attention to what I'm saying long enough to understand the issue at hand. 
 Any ideas from the group here? I'm about out of ideas to try and get this figured out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment, my house has a NAS set up (QNAP TS-453D) and Kodi streaming on our TV, with no special media software running on the NAS. Just Kodi accessing the shared files. I also various services set up (portainer, home assistant, transmission, etc) on the local network, but nothing is accessible from outside the network because I just wanted to keep things simple.
 My girlfriend wants to be able to access our videos while travelling, however, and specifically asked if we could set up a Plex server. I'm not sure if it'd be worth the trouble to set up just for the occasions when we're travelling (which is usually to see friends and family, but sometimes while doing that we want to watch movies from our NAS together - right now we just copy those movies to her laptop in advance).
 I figure I could just set up a local VPN server (wireguard?) on the NAS so we can tunnel into the local network and use Kodi to play files that way. But, I'm curious, is there any advantage (or disadvantage) to using Plex remote play instead, or setting up Jellyfin? Would it be more/less secure? Easier/harder to set up? Provide better/worse video quality or performance? Anything else I should know?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: what are best practices or tips simplicity and security wise for running many vs fewer Containers for many services on a single machine?
 ​
 Hi,
 some months ago I started self-hosting some things on my home server (a simple PC with an Intel i3 10th Gen. (4 x 3.7 GHz), 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, external HDD).
 The hosted services include Nextcloud, Gitea, a Minecraft-Server, Vaultwarden, Heimdall, WikiJS, and NGINX as a reverse proxy, many of them as Docker Containers.
 I just tried things out, followed tutorials, and "hacked" the things together without thinking too much about the overall structure of my build.
 Now that I have quite some services running I'm thinking about the pros and cons of different methods of running these things. Right now I have Proxmox installed on the server and one LXC for each single service (so e.g. 5 LXC's for 5 services) that I'm running, thinking that if I "destroy" one Container, the rest will be still intact, so I don't have to repair too much.
 What do you think are good ways to host the services? One LXC with Docker and all the Docker-based services on that single LXC? Or rather one service per LXC like I do right now, although that means I have to create an LXC, install Docker, ... for every single service? What about security? Is more virtualization really more secure or just more work?
 Personally I don't think VMs are a good choice for me because of resource constraints. That's why I use LXCs.
 I know there might not be the one right way to do it, but I'd like to get some insights so I can make an informed decision.
 ​
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a small business with only 3 people. Looking to setup some kind of File Management system so we can have everything nice and organized like files, documents, bank statements, QuickBooks files, invoices, etc. Right now everything is stored on our main PC and if we need to transfer a file we just email it or something but I'm looking to have it so whatever device you are on you can just open the Files app and have everything you need. I'm open to cloud based or local storage. If local storage is needed I am advanced in computers can set it up.
 We have many things on paper like Receipts, Invoices, Documents. I want to find a way to just digitize everything securely as we have done everything on paper and want to go digital. We have the top of the line equipment Computers, Printers, Receipt & Document Scanners, but just need better organization and ideas. 
 Devices we use regularly:
 3 Desktop PCs
 1 MacBook Pro
 1 iPad Pro
 iPhones for Mobile
 Applications & Software:
 Gmail
 QuickBooks
 Google Sheets
 Adobe Acrobat (PDF)
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions for ways to just link up all of these apps and files that would be great. I'm also open to paying a little bit for any alternatives to any apps or ways to use our computers to make sure everything works flawless. Example, if its better to use Office 365 instead of Google etc I can change that. Thank you for any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Some weeks ago I discovered (maybe from a dashboard posted here?) ntopng: a self-hosted network monitor tool.
 Ideally these systems work by listening on a "mirrored port" on the switch, but mine doesn't have a mirrored port, so I configured the system in another way: ntopng listens on some packet-capture files grabbed as streams from my Fritz!Box.
 Since mirrored ports are very uncommon on home routers but Fritz!Boxes are quite popular, I've written a short post on my process, including all the needed configuration/docker-compose/etc, so if any of you has the same setup and wants to quickly try it out, you can within minutes :)
 Thinking it would be beneficial to the community, I posted it here.

 I was wondering if getting a 12 bay Synology would be the best option or should I look at going custom and using something like TrueNas or Unraid?
 I have a NUC with Ubuntu running Docker for Plex, Unifi, etc. 
 The thing I love about my Synology or any NAS is that it's small and is just a case for drives. They are also quiet and are pretty good with power consumption. And after spending all day working in IT, I don't want to spend hours and hours on setup and configuration. I love the ease of set up. With that said, I have built my own PC for 20 years so I'm no stranger to assembling hardware or setting up systems.
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m slowly growing my homelab and I’m keeping everything private on my own network. This works great. I have a custom DNS record at the router level that I can use. I would like to start branching out and enabling https. However my understanding is that to get a cert from a CA this would require some of my information to be publicly exposed. I would like to avoid this. The only way I use my self hosted apps from my homelab are via my home network or by tunneling into my network via a vpn or tailscale. Any suggestions on how I can achieve this without exposing my info to the public?
 I understand that this might not be possible, but thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 0.16 of the free and open source web desktop Orb has been released. Orb simulates a Windows-like desktop in a web browser. You can use it to access files on a server or a NAS in an easy and secure way. It uses jQuery, Bootstrap and a PHP backend.
 With the release of the previous version, you asked for a code editor. So, a code editor is what you get. It's built with the Ace editor, so it has code highlighting, themes, auto indent, validation checks and other code editing stuff.
 This version also allows users to have their own static website and change their password.
 Download at Gitlab or try the online demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have about 30 services running on my small homeserver. When i access them from outside of my home network, i use my Wireguard VPN. None of the services is exposed to the internet at the moment.
 Now i would like expose some of my services (like Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Vaultwarden, ...), so that my family and some friends can use them without using a VPN on their devices.
 All my services are currently behind a Traefik Reverse Proxy. My initial idea was to use an IPWhiteList for all services that i don't want to be accessible from the internet, so that only local IP-adresses and the VPN subnet would be on the whitelist. I assume i could do something similar with Authelia and increase security a bit by using 2FA.
 What other tools or approaches (CrowdSec?, Fail2ban?, Cloudflare Tunnels?, ...) do you recommend when exposing a subnet of services to the public internet?

 my goal is to publish my home server (which mainly includes some applications running on docker compose)
 I have been researching about this topic and I came across few possibilities
  
Self hosted gateway (the issue is that tunnels are established for each application). I was not able to publish only my Nginx Proxy Manager which would route traffic towards local containers.
  
2)Netmaker... I wasn't really able to understand how it works
 3) Any easy method via Wireguard? Like a connection initiated from the client side (home server) towards a VPS?
 Note: I am aiming for a free open source self hosted solution (FOSS)
 Thanks

 I recently purchased a Qnap TS-464 and would like to add a UPS to my installation. I just need a few minutes of autonomy to shut down the NAS properly. Today I only have one NAS, three Raspi's and one switch, however I'm thinking of adding a small server in a while.
 Also, I've been looking at what UPS's are out there, however I'd like to know what your recommendations would be for this kind of small installation?
 Thanks and have a nice day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently use BoxCryptor to manage my files on a local NAS (Synology DS918+). Given Boxcryptor is shutting down since they have sold their tech assets to Dropbox, so I'm having to move to a new platform. I've got some prior experience with Cryptomator which has been OK, but not entirely positive - albeit it was a few years ago.
 Key considerations:
  
MacOS (M1) is my main machine and I would like good filesystem integration - I currently use Forklift alongside Finder.
 I only need remote access, no local mirroring, no sync. Ability to selectively mark files to be mirrored locally on my laptop would be a bonus.
 Approx 15tb data - files from 1kb to 25gb.
 Ability to search, see thumbnails, doc previews etc across the encrypted share.
 90% of my data will be on the Synology, but I will also use some remote cloud storage - integration with such services is a plus.
 Versioning and such a further plus.
  
In doing a bit of reading around the topic, it seems that installing something on the Synology itself is an option - for example, there seems to be a NextCloud docker image and I believe I can access Nextcloud via WebDav through Finder/Forklift. However similarly, I've not always had great performance with web-dav and I'm not sure if will let me index/search/preview files efficiently.
 Grateful for any suggestions. 
 I have a MountainDuck license should that be a relevant part of the solution.
 Thanks!

 I wrote a tool that could be handy for some of you.
 filedriller walks a directory tree and identifies all regular files by type with siegfried. Furthermore it creates UUIDv4s, hash sums (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 or blake2b-512), gathers some metadata and can check whether the file is in the NSRL.
 It is beta, it is open source, useful feedback welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past month I've been replacing most of the x264 files on my 4TB external HDD because it started showing signs of filling up. Some of the older 1080p videos were as large as 20GB+ which made me gasp when I compared them to the newer x265 ones which were only 3-5GB in size.
 While looking for major differences in quality, I didn't really notice anything drastic but I'm probably just not looking in the right places. I understand things like bitrate etc will be the main culprits here, but am I on the right track in believing that x265 can truly be this efficient when it comes to the ratio of file size / quality?
 If there are any handy guides / videos about this topic, I would really appreciate the links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ive been googling around for more than an hour but am still not sure how to do this.
 I don’t really want to expose any of my services to the internet. Maybe someday I will, but for now only I use them and I would rather VPN in everytime instead of exposing anything to the outside.
 The main reason why I even want to setup a reverse proxy is because vaultwarden only works when I have one because it needs HTTPS. Also its great if all of my services use https, even if my only point of entry is my VPN and no one should be able to access them anyways. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on actually using vaultwarden until Im sure everything’s secure.
 But whenever I find guides or questions about making a local reverse proxy, people still talk about me needing a (bought) domain. Why do I still need one when I am local anyways? 
 I would like to do either of this, preferring the latter. 1. Enter my IP with the specific services port and just be redirected so https is used 2. Enter a domain like jellyfin.example.local and I get redirected to the ip:port for that specific subdomain. Surely it is possible to „make up“ a domain and tell whatever resolves domains at the lowest level to redirect this to a specific ip:port? Maybe this also isnt possible, thats why I am asking.
 Thanks in advance for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a FaaS (function-as-a-service, like AWS Lambda) to host on my home server, but I found the popular options to be either complex or require Kubernetes. So, I decided to make my own.
 This is in very initial stages. Currently, it only has a web interface (without authentication), which allows you to register functions and invoke them from the web UI (including providing input to it). There is a brief demo on the Github page. I have also included a docker-compose.yml to make it easier to try out. Also, I have only written 1 (example) function so far.
 Link: https://github.com/sparkymat/fundock
 I'd love for people to try it out and give me some feedback. Some of my top priorities currently include:
  
Add API for registering and invoking functions (authenticated using long-lived API tokens)
 Asynchronous execution (and post-execution web hook)
 Terminate containers after timeout
 Some form of concurrent execution limit
 Ability to disable/delete functions

 I'm was thinking of trying to find some mini-ITX motherboard (nothing in mind yet), but was wondering if any single-board computer, à la Raspberry Pi, would exist for such an use case on the market. Would you know of any company selling a single-board computer with built-in IPMI (remote power on/off, remote view, kb/m, mounting ISO / USD…)?
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been looking at buying a NAS for a while now, but now I'm thinking it would be more fun to build one.
 Usage would be mainly storage and cloud (eg. next-cloud) and some services (home assistant, docker containers, some VMs). Still don't know if Proxmox or TrueNAS scale as OS.
 I don't know what to choose for CPU and MB. What I was aiming for was to do everything at adequate performance but with an eye to energy consumption (Italy where energy is not free at all). Not a clear idea on the budget, mainly around 600/700 euros, lower the better.
 The only starting point was the case (Silverstone CS351), since is the only one with "small" size and hot-swap bays (which I'd like to have) that i found easily available, but anything better is welcomed.
 Thanks for the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a old "server" with OVH, it's a i5-2400. It has served me well, but it's single 2TB spinner , 16gb ram and CPU are now being a problem.
 I was thinking of upgrading to one of those Kimsufi dedicated servers, either a E3-1231v3 or a E5-1620v2.
 Issue is, those CPUs don't have Quicksync. How much of a problem will that be for transcoding ? It's mostly 1/2 1080p streams at a time, usually h264 (since the i5 doesn't support h265).
 Would you advise against such cpu for this kind of tasks ?
 In the end i will be using Proxmox, with Deluge, the Arrsuite, mailcow and few more apps here and there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there.
 I'm currently using Tidal as my music app on my phone and my pc. I like it because it allows me to stream high quality music to my phone, my pc, and my car with android auto, and it allows me to chromecast to my smart speaker.
 What I don't like is its limited library. I would like to listen to my CD-ripped music.
 I would like to avoid to pay a monthly fee and instead buy CDs and high quality music online, like qobuz.
 So I was wondering if there is a server software to run on my Raspberry Pi 4, that allows me to play music the way I do with Tidal?
 I've found something interesting in "mStream", but it lacks of the chromecast functionality.
 Do you have any experience with this? What do you use for high quality music streaming?

 Container Nursery, this project helped me to achieve my requirement. Thanks to the community for all valuable suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I started building my homelab the way I can provision all stuff from one place.
 The part I am proud of:
 Right now I manage docker mule with ansible. Traefik and dashboard is autopopulated with labels ( homepage is great, ansible-nas is sometimes outdated but can be easily fixed ) . 
 Pihole works as conditional DNS in this setup to provide internal domain resolution for services (alongside with traefik as internal proxy too) 
 The part I am struggle with (right now): 
 I have to set up public hostname manually for every external service. (Via Cloudflare zero trust dashboard) Looking for a advice how to add those automagically. How to tell cloudflared docker container to push new services if needed. Or I got this idea wrong
 ​
 The part I have to have done in next iterations:
  
Populate pihole local dns automagically based on xxx_available_internally var in ansible-nas (this should not be that hard except for putting lot of code for every single service)
 Git gud with virtualisation idea (how to proper set up resources for VM because right now its by trial and mostly errors)
 Set up proxmox, and those VM's with code (I still trying to avoid rewrite everything to terraform) 
 Automate generating/provisioning api keys for services I would like to have widget in homepage dashboard 
 Prepare backup plan
 Publish code
 Add UPS and resolve hdd fan issue on host (HP Elitedesk 800 g2 mini 65w, i5-6500, 8GB, 512GB ssd)
 Think about android phones ignore DHCP settings for DNS (or maybe its just Brave browser)
  
​
 Idea of what I am trying to achieve?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a "server" with about 30 TB of storage that is placed at my mom's house, that runs win11, and a plex server. I watch my content recently via Infuse on my Apple TV and everything is working well. But I kinda wanna remove plex from my setup, since it feels kinda redundant, and I don't like the way they are heading. 
 I'm somewhat tech savvy, but above all I just want my setup to be reliable and work all the time. Hence why I have gone with just win11 and plex, since that is something I find myself extremely comfortable with. 
 Do you guys have some suggestions on how I can improve my setup? Windows 11 tends to update from time to time and get stuck on the "setup screen" which causes some annoyance, and plex just feels redundant now and more like someone snooping on anything I do more than anything else since Infuse is serving the FE. Any answers or input is greatly appreciated

I have 384 GB of DDR4 2133p and 38 TB in a raid 10 configuration (2 RAID Array). It also has 56 threads at 3.6 GHZ. What's your guys's opinion on it? Oh BTW, I'm making it for my kids... they go to colleges across the country from each other and I figured them being able to still play with each other might make them not so home sick.

Ideally I'd like to have a bitwarden (vaultwarden actually) instance, a nextcloud instance, and maybe 1-2 other things like that. How would I go about this? I've been trying for hours all day today to figure this out but I'm losing my shit since I do not ever deal w/ web stuff and hate it. 
 Note: I am quite an experienced programmer and know my way around Linux very well, but this shit is bonkers to me. So, please help me out! And yes, a docker container w/ nginx running on ports 80/443 (https please!) would be ideal. I also have a lot of ports forwarding to my home server, including 80 and 443. I have DNS records with cloudflare's free tier pointing to my home ip but it **never** goes to my damn server itself. It either fails or goes to the router's page. Thanks for the help/advice!!

When I fly to my destination, I may carry-on a drive case to mitigate the risk for some of the drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of getting a DL380 Gen 9 that I acquired set up to serve as my primary NAS (at least at my home).
 I spent some hours (re: many of them) messing around with it over the holiday weekend. I had pulled a Dell H710 that was flashed to IT mode to replace the janky HP Smart Array adapter but while it would see it as a device in the bios, I could never get it to actually boot from any drives connected to it. TrueNAS could see it and address the drives just fine, but would not boot after installation. Legacy or UEFI made no difference. I finally gave up, put the HP adapter back in, set it to 'HBA' mode (which is kind of a misnomer with that card), reinstalled TrueNAS Scale for the 4th time and proceeded to configure the machine.
 It works but the HP adapter doesn't pass SMART info to TruNAS, so I'd be reliant on notifications from the iLO in case one of the boot pool SSDs fail or whatnot. 
 Ye, I attempted to search for solutions for both the Dell LSI card and the HP 'HBA' but found nothing that seemed useful. Saw some posts about taping a couple of pins on the H710, but the symptom didn't match what I was experiencing. 
 Thinking I might want to find an actual LSI card that the HP bios will boot from then rebuild the OS before I start moving data to it. Just for peace of mind, familiarity, and centralized SMART notifications. I'd end up having 2 LSI cards, as in order to run the external JBOD I have a LSI SAS9200-8e to facilitate my capacity drives, which appears to be working fine, but I don't intend to boot from it (If I even could on this machine). 
 In the future I may slap some cheap SSDs into the 6 free SFF slots for a fast pool for VMs or whatever at some point, so having them all in a similar ecosystem might be easier down the road.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings!
 Recently I was asked about a budget AI / ML workload, and decided to test it against some of my own lab GPUs. 
 I'll be adding more tests, and benchmarks over time, but below is a link to my website where I covered it. As well as the code I wrote to benchmark them. 
 Hopefully this helps someone out there. :-)

 Anything like that exist? What I envision is basically like a chat room except it's reddit posts, FB Marketplace posts and eBay posts. Have it running on a separate monitor, on the TV, while I take a shit, anywhere in the house if I like. Or even like a stock ticker display!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kind of a mixed bag topic, but figured I'd ask - does anyone have recommendations for a mesh WiFi system (preferably WiFi 6/6e capable) that is friendly towards self hosters? What I mean by that is either DD-WRT can be installed on it, or the interface allows for an appropriate level of tweaking (opening/forwarding ports, DDNS, etc.)?
 Budget is up to $300 but can do more if a product absolutely ticks every box, coverage area is a 2-floor 2500 sqft house and a few wireless cameras on the corners of the house, and I'd not mind having a wired backhaul for each puck. Total device count right now is just shy of 50, with only 10 of those permanently wired and the rest WiFi. Device count may increase to as many as 75 once I replace some WiFi light bulbs and my girlfriend moves in with me in a few months.
 Some nice-to-haves would be:
  
Compatible with Let's Encrypt for SSL cert on the config page
 WAN accessibility, preferably not dependent on a proprietary app
 Can be configured for DDNS for the self-hosting aspect of things
 I wouldn't mind being able to further modify WiFi-specific settings - antenna-specific transmit power, encryption type (WPA3 would be awesome), etc.
 Guest network is cool, but not a strict requirement
  
I'm asking in this sub, as opposed to others, as I'm specifically seeking guidance on the customization/features that self hosters need from their network equipment.
 Appreciate any advice or feedback, thanks!

My first thought was to replace the old desktop with a Synology NAS (and switch from Milestone to Synology's Surveillance software) however it looks like the newer Synology devices don't do transcoding as well due to the lack of GPU. Can someone recommend a replacement solution please? I would prefer something smaller than a desktop and relatively quiet.

Any recommendations for a case that includes a hot-swap backplane for 10-12 HDDs? It can be big and ugly but I'd like to keep it under $200 if possible. Also I'll need an internal SATA expansion card too so a recommendation there would be appreciated (6 port).
 Current hardware:
  
Ryzen 5 1600
 MSI X470 Gaming Plus Max (6x SATA ports)
 32GB DDR4-3200
 GTX 1050 ti
 SATA: 8x 4TB, 1x 256GB SSD (cache drive)
 M.2 NVMe boot drive
  
The plan is to have the 8TB drives in a mergerfs + snapraid pool. I would also consider selling the CPU, mobo and GPU and switching to Intel QSV solution too which might be easier.
 Edit: Silverstone CS380B looks perfect but prices have gone waaayyy up. Was less than $140 a few years ago.

The connection is via the Red,yellow, white cables. The video is fidgeting and terrible quality when converting. I tried it on both a Mac and a PC with the same terrible quality.
 However, I plugged the camcorder directly into my TV with the RCA cables and the quality was excellent. Now the question is how do I get that good quality onto digital? I'm thinking the issue is that the quality is getting messed up going through the conversion device but when its directly on the tv its fine. 
 I'm thinking I need to find a dvd recording device to convert the tapes to dvd and then to digital? Want to get some help on if that's the right thinking and right next step?

The thing is humming along nicely and set up to serve my home, providing with 8TB ZFS backed storage which is, for now, plenty for my needs - all the initial data over the years amounts to ~3TB so I have some headroom still. This is mostly archival data - media, documents, etc. Things that I store once, I read every now and then and are never deleted. 
 Now I'm turning my attention to backup solutions. I have gone through the sub's wiki on the subject (great resource) and I have a few ideas of my own for local and offsite, but I'd be interested on what your particular set up is - whether you're using ZFS send/receive and into what, online storage and how you sync your data in there, costs. Whatever's working well for you I'm interested to know about.
 Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble getting this to work. Diagram here: https://imgur.com/xLMVzeE
 The goal is to use an old wifi router and use it so that all of my wifi cameras connect to it so that the cameras 1) Are isolated from my home network and 2) Have no internet connection.
 Some information about the set up:
  
Server is a laptop with two NICs
 Server runs Linux Mint
 I do not want to use VLANs
  
I did some digging and know that I should connect the secondary router's WAN to the server's NIC. However, I can't figure out how to access the router's login page (from the server) which probably means the server won't be able to access the RTSP streams either.
 There are a lot of network settings (DHCP etc.) on the server (Linux Mint) that I'm sure I have to set up but have no idea on how to do it. All of my Google searches aren't turning up with setups similar to mine.
 Can you help me?

 But, in the past I've read negative things about Oracle privacy-wise, and unlike Hetzner it is not based in the EU (the company not the servers). On Google Cloud I noticed once that it's possible to encrypt your VM with your own encryption keys. Does someone know if something like this is available with Oracle Cloud as well, I didn't quite find anything regarding this.

 I'm curious of the following:
  
Is the Mac Pro 2013 a good choice for ESX? (I'm looking for something low-cost where I can upgrade the CPU and RAM)
 I want to run ESX 8. Anyone doing that successfully?
 How does OS support work? The Mac Pro 2013 doesn't support Ventura but if I virtualized it on it with ESX will the VM install\run?
 How loud is this trashcan going to sound?

 For the latter, I have everything set up over CloudFlare tunnels, so I can easily access them via, for example, https://radarr.example.com
 I am trying to get my Wordpress instance to work over tunnels. I want to be able to access Wordpress via, for example, www.example.com/wordpress. I tried tunnelling www.example.com to localhost:80 and this works, but only for the main Apache landing page (that is index.html in the root of my web server). Any Wordpress pages (using the sub folder of /wordpress) otherwise display a local IP rather than example.com/wordpress/some_page.php
 I think there is some nuance I am missing to get this to work. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.

 Has anyone used this for Homelab? I'm in the midst of doing a rebuild, and am exploring distros to play with (nothing mission critical on my lab, can tear down and rebuild in a few hours if needed). 
 I like the Insights Portal and the auto patching and the general visibility into the servers thanks to RHEL's web portal. But it is a fair amount of mental overhead to learn the "RHEL way". 
 Is it worth investing the time to learn it for homelabbing? I don't need to learn this for my job or anything, so that's no motivation. 
 I'd like to hear from the community here.

 The positives I have is easy backups and general management of the server. I was thinking about buying another Synology solely as an off-site backup.
 But Im thinking, before I get even more entrenched in the Synology space, should I maybe just get these used enterprise servers or something like that and try to switch away from Synology?
 How hard is it to setup RAID, backup to another remote server, general management of the server, like firewall etc.?
 I am also thinking about upgradeability. I don’t know how much the enterprise servers are upgradeable, but I assume far better than Synologys, where you can only add RAM, and even that is limited.

 Hi guys,
 A bit of a newbie here, so bear with me.
 I'm currently running openvpn on my wrt router and it has been working just fine, but due to my needs of hosting a server at home and accessing it remotely, I have purchased a dedicated IP address from my VPN provider, but I am quite confused on how I am supposed to set it up, they literally only provided the IP address that was assigned to me, is that all I need to configure it? and if so, where do I plug it in, in my .ovpn file somewhere?
 Sorry if it's a dumb question but I cannot find any info on google, maybe I'm googling the wrong words. 
 Thanks in advance

 I read that avoiding 192.168.x.x altogether is a good idea? 
 What to use then? Something like 10.25.50.x? I also like 19.168.50.x but the avoiding 192.168. stops me, also 192.168 is also quite chaos.
 Edit: Thanks everyone! I chose 10.0.50.x, as it suits my purposes for now and is quite simple. If I decide to use VLANs or anything in the future I can expand easily.

 Bitwarden's on-prem setup instructions are good, if a little brief and lacking in detail, and I got there in the end, but it wasn't an easy deployment. I thought I'd write some lessons I learned on the way to help anyone considering this. Hope this helps someone on the same journey!

 I am currently in India and have been waiting to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi 4 since over a year to starting my self-hosting journey. Sadly, they are never in stock or just been sold at double the normal price. So, I came across this piece of hardware which I found to be more worth than a Raspberry Pi in my country i.e Dell Optiplex 3040 - Core i3 6th gen 3.2ghz, 8 GB ram & 240gb SSD storage(Renewed). 
 The things I want to host:-
 -Bitwarden
 -Simplelogin
 -NextCloud
 -Notes
 -PiHole
 -PiVPN
 -5 single page static websites
 -And a few more things I'll come across in my self-hosting journey 
 I wanted to know If I could run those on the device mentioned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soo... For a long time I was using my pc as a data storage but recently decided that it is time to get some new fancy NAS. My requirements were quite simple (as I thought): Plug-n-play box, 4 hard drives, 2 m2 slots, and can run Plex with hardware encoding. 
 After some research, I came to the conclusion that there is no simple solution for a reasonable price. 
 QNAP seems to collect all security breaches in the recent two years - no, thank you.
 Asustor offers good hardware but very mediocre soft. 
 Synology was the most promising among "big players" DS920 + looks good, but m2 can only be used for caching, fortunately, DS923+ has just been released. And it's worse than the previous model?? If I understand correctly, they made it possible to use m2 as storage but switched to Ryzen CPU without hardware encoding. Also, 1GbE ports in the 2023 model, just why? 
 Other Synology models that match my simple needs are in the 1k USD range, at this point I might as well say fuck the environment and keep my PC running 24/7 
 Please, share your wisdom, what is worth buying in 2023?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the year comes to a close, I'm curious to know which self-hosted apps Redditors have used the most in 2022 (excluding utility services like reverse proxies or something like Coolify, Dokku, Portainer). So more something like Nextcloud, Rocket.chat, Gitlab.
 For me, i think the five most important were (in alphabetical order) AdGuard Home, Mailcow, Onedev, Paperless, Plausible. They all have their own unique features and benefits. 
 Adguard: Adguard Home is a self-hosted ad blocker that can be used to block ads and tracking scripts on your home network. It works by acting as a local DNS server, which allows it to intercept and block requests to known ad and tracking servers before they reach your device. 
 Mailcow: Mailcow is a self-hosted mail server that provides a full-featured email solution for small to medium-sized organizations. It includes features such as spam and virus protection, and support for multiple domains. 
 Onedev: Onedev is a self-hosted Git repository management platform that includes features for code review, project management, and continuous integration. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.
 Paperless: Paperless is a self-hosted document management system that allows you to store, organize, and access your digital documents from anywhere. In 2022 the fork paperless-ngx was released. 
 Plausible: Plausible is a self-hosted web analytics platform that provides simple, privacy-friendly tracking for your website. It allows you to see how many people are visiting your site, where they are coming from, and which pages they are viewing.
 What about you? What are your top five self-hosted apps of the year? Were there new ones that you started using in 2022? Share your experiences with them and why you think they stand out from the rest.
 Edit: Forgot AdGuard Home, so swapped it for WordPress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/homelab,
 Currently working entry level IT, but looking to practice with a homelab at home. I would like to create a lab to setup/have/learn pihole, plex, virtualization, azure, active directory, game server hosting, study for certifications etc. Here is a list of items I own/ ordered over boxing day:
 _
  
Router: ASUS Wireless AX5700 Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6 Router (RT-AX86S)
 TP-Link 8 Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch (TL-SG108E)
 Dell OptiPlex 3050, Micro, 1x Intel Core i5 Quad (i5-7500T) 2.70 GHz, 16 GB, 500 GB, No Optical, Intel Integrated Graphics, 64-bit Windows 10 Home
 Raspberry Pi 4 - 4 or 8 gb ram (don't recall)
  
_ 
Items I got for free but unsure if it would work for my plans.
  
Orico 4 bay external hdd - https://www.amazon.ca/External-Enclosure-Support-Aluminum-Storage/dp/B07XL2BS53?th=1 Not quite the same, but close. No RAID button at the back. 
 
LaCie 2big Thunderbolt 2 - https://www.lacie.com/ca/en/support/raid/2big-thunderbolt-2/
 
 Main plan for now would be setting up the dell to run pihole and plex. Many posts about people running this in docker containers. Just trying to figure out how to set myself up. Reading many threads of people buying a newer NAS to run plex on directly. or using an older one to host to plex files and run it through the dell to transcode. 
 (Bought a cheap plex lifetime subscription a long time ago, finally had funds + time to start this endeavor.)
 Sorry for the rambling, just looking for some advice guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story is I have 3 docker swarm nodes with x.x.x.10 virtual ip across all notes using keepalived and x.x.x.11 x.x.x.12 x.x.x.13 static ip at each node. For services exposing web I am using traefik with port forwarding to x.x.x.10 All nodes also have glusterfs replicated storage, so I can take two nodes down and still have all services.
 Right now, all services or containers on overlay network expose ports on 0.0.0.0 which I want to limit for some applications to maybe another virtual ip using keepalived (e.g., x.x.x.18) or a specific node's ip like x.x.x.12
 The goal in mind is to leverage docker's overlay network but limit it to specific ip. Now that I am tying this out, I am having doubts whether this would even be supported or work properly. If a single virtual IP and a single container are running on different hosts, would docker even route traffic properly in that case?
 One use case that I would apply this is having two pihole replicas on different nodes, but come think of it, maybe running three replicates with each host LAN ip (.11 .12 .13) could work just as well

 I am a Network Engineer by trade however I have not had the luxury of playing around with physical routers or servers in person. I have also been a lurker and hoping to build my own lab. So I've bought my first component!
 I have just received my R620 (barebones, included fans and psu) however I'm looking at the specs and I can see that I can run an E5-2600 V1 or V2. My question is, How can I tell if I have the BIOS from V1 or V2? can I just buy a couple of V2 CPU's (If people have suggestions on a CPU aswell that would be greatly appreciated (Hoping to use it as a storage and virtualisation server)) and check the BIOS before I load it with an OS (probably UNRAID)?

 A lot of budget builds and suggestion for hardware I found were really focusing on power efficiency. However I don’t have to pay for the energy bills in my Appartement, so energy efficiency is no real factor for me. Does this open doors for new hardware? If yes, what would you suggest.
 Currently I have a RaspberryPi as a NAS but I had some troubles with dust coming into my USB ports and I want 10 Gbit connectivity in my next NAS. Also upgradability is not really given in my opinion.

 The constant spin up causes serious performance issues when trying to work from it.
 It does not respect Windows power plan, 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' in Device Manager is disabled by default and the WD Elements is not supported by the WD utility.
 To keep it awake I resorted to using a script to touch an empty file every 20 seconds. But this workaround is a bit hacky, not to mention it is still a problem when using the drive somewhere else.
 Is there any hope to disabling the aggressive hardware sleep on this thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I picked up some SanDisk non-Dell branded SSD's over on homelabsales with 97 - 100% life left on them for a good deal. I have a R730xd with a PERC H730P Mini RAID controller. I can make the drives non-RAID drives via Dell's management software and the SanDisk software is able to see the drives, read SMART data, and update firmware. However, the Dell management software or the OS still doesn't appear to get the SMART data. Plus, I would like to put some of these drives in a RAID array.
 What are my options to try and accomplish this? I've read the H330 controllers can be flashed into IT mode, but I don't believe that will allow me to create a RAID array.
 Any thoughts or suggestions is appreciated.
 Thanks!

 Now I bought the WM14NS40 with the UGreen 12v Sata to USB 3 adapter. Reviews from Amazon says it should work but its Amazon. I also 3D Printed a case in PETG.
 ​
 Issues I've been having:
 Drive not showing up at all,
 Drive showing up but crashing the file explorer which then makes Windows completely unstable until reboot,
 Drive working and plays 2 seconds of a CD and unable to play Blu-rays.
 ​
 I've downloaded the latest firmware from LG but it was already at the latest.
 In Device Manager it says it using the driver cdrom.sys Version 10.0.19041.1266.
 I done some search of people having the same issues but they never say what IS the problem.
 Now I'm just hoping you guys will know anything about this to point me to another subreddit that may know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm planning to add 10G to my lab. For now, it's going to be a point-to-point connection specifically for MPI. It's what I call a JoJa-class cluster - it's bizarre, and it's an adventure to get it working. I'm thinking about two options: good ol' copper (like cat6) and fiber in the form of SFP+ - SFP+ cable (i.e. with already attached transceivers). The first option seems somewhat easier, but I'm worried about possible EMI and, therefore, higher latency. The second one seems more solid, but I've never worked with fiber before.
 Are my worries unfounded? Should I go with the fiber option?
 P.S. The "cluster" consists of two nodes: Intel i7-12700K with 128 GB DDR4-3600, and AMD Ryzen 7950x with 128 GB DDR5-4000, both running NixOS. Curiously, their performance per hyperthread is pretty close.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've currently got a Dell MD1200 (12 LFF drivebays). I'm using it with shucked WD drives.
 To reduce power consumption I've removed one of the EM modules as there no benefit to having it powered as all the drives are SATA and I don't need to split the enclosure. However the enclosure is still power hungry (even with all the drives removed).
 On top of this it appears to have an intermittent fault, or at least it thinks it does. Every few minutes it'll turn the status LED orange and ramp the fans up to 100% before slowing the fans down and going back to blue. However I can't see any errors in any logs and the drives are all fully accessible.
 I'm therefore thinking it might be time to replace it with something else, but I'm not sure what.
 Does anyone have any suggestions for an external enclosure that will take at least 12 x 3.5" SATA drives and is available in the UK.

Photos, videos, games, music, shows, Wikipedia other sites I deem valuable tools. However I am wanting to upgrade to something more modern. 
 I am considering making a new Nas borderline just a server. Because I want to segment it with a few vm's to hoast things like websites and email etc but I am unsure what to use (hardware) to meet these desired goals. I would like to use plex with it for my media locally but im not seeing a solution with a high core/thread count and it being viable with plex. I only need plex to stream steadily at 1080p ideally but 720 will do. Any suggestions to look at would be great.

 Here's what I am looking for:
 I have 3-4 email boxes which receive emails which I would like to assign a ticket number to and have an agent accept responsibility for the ticket and then have a thread between the user and the agent about said ticket number. It would be nice if these were able to be archived. Currently I am using a shared inbox and each of the current agents have their own email boxes. A website chat widget would be a huge bonus. 
 Something self hosted would be nice but Id be open to something freeium if need be. Just curious if someone could give me insight on a similar situation and what the setup looks like etc. 
 Thanks!

 They are sold with a 3-year warranty from MD TECH INC. They do not appear to have a website, however their support email "cs@mdtechusa.com" appears to be valid and uses Microsoft Outlook for their MX servers. 
 diskprices is labeling these drives as "new." I'm not sure why, because the amazon page makes no such claims. While they don't explicitly state that their drives are refurbished, the fact that they don't call them new should give credit to the claims that they are refurbished drives. 
 I decided to buy one, because my data is unimportant and easily replaceable. 
 The drive came in a box, which was inside an amazon bag. Inside of the box, the only protection for the drive are two thin HDPE plastic molding on either end of the drive. Pic 1, Pic 2 Edit: The drive was in an anti-static bag.
 Here is the smart data for the drive, with 10 Decimal values.
 Here is a benchmark of the drive.
 Let me know if there's any other information you'd like about the drive and i'll do my best to provide it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for help / suggestions on how to actually mount pcie cards which are plugged into m2 risers such as the attached image...
 The issue is, 
 A) when I put it in the closest m2 slot on the MB the card does not fit (the pcie is not as recessed as the real slots and so the bracket can't be screwed in.
 B) when I use a more out of the way M2 slot the riser cable is so rigid... It may be possible to do some really slick tri-folds... But it doesn't seem right off the bat.
 C) when I think of using the closest m2 with a vertical riser then I have to move two other cards to vertical risers also which they get all fumbly and interfere with each other..
 Perhaps there exists some sort of 3D printable bracket that pulls the card back off the motherboard a bit to accomodate a fold or bulk of a riser or the amount of lift from the M2 card... But what are you all doing to get these to fit??
 PS. My case is Thermaltake P3 and my MB is MSI z690 Tomahawk DDR4. There are 3 x16 on the board but last one operates only at x1. I've got a gpu, TB4, card and a 10g SFP. Which is why I need to use one of the M2 which is pcie4x4.

 I'm still running my first NAS built in 2008 which at the time was built off Windows Home Server. Over time as that no longer became supported, I upgraded to Windows 10 using Storage Spaces as an easy to use redundancy option for my drives. I backup my NAS every few months to an offline external drive and this strategy has worked well over the years. I've barely had to touch my NAS for many years.
 I'm slowly trying to ween myself off the comfort of a Windows based NAS, and have been playing with the Linux options. Hoping to get steered in the right direction based on my requirements:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am looking into different self hosted chat options. I'm gonna share my story here a bit to explain what my community is looking for. 
 ​
 We are a huge Roleplay community. Roleplay means, multiple accounts and profiles for the characters and identities my users use. 
 Currently we use XenForo. It's amazing, we don't use the forum part we just use an addon they have called Chat by Siropu 2. everything works great but we have a lot of complaints that it's not that good on mobile. and theres no app either. they have to get on a browser and visit the site. 
 ​
 We tried Discord. but many of our users get locked out after they have 5-10 accounts for their characters because discord begins asking for phone numbers etc. 
 ​
 we moved to Rocket chat hosted in a site called cloud jiffy. worked well but we were paying $50 a month and 1 day.......the whole chat just vanished. so we went back to Xenforo. 
 ​
 We've now found Virola chat. This service is PERFECT because we admins can create as many user profiles and accounts as we want directly from the admin panel and hand over the login to our roleplayers. https://virola.io/
 there's also an app for the phones which makes things a lot better. 
 however where should I host this? what host do you recommend? we are about 9 or 10 REAL people with around 60-70 profiles/accounts in total inside the chat, so it's not like in Real people we're a ton and need a ton of resources for a server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've been testing and watching NextCloud for a while. I see that it brings a LOT of benefits(you can have your own google suit with 100% of privacy and it's FREE!) but I always had an issue with NextCloud being so slow.
 After trying several setups (apache + php fpm, nginx + php fpm and openlitespeed with lsphp) I think I found the fastest way to host and to use NextCloud. I made a guide step-by-step that is free and you can check it right now: https://theselfhosting.art/how-to-setup-the-fastest-nextcloud-ever-on-debian-11/ 
 Benefits of this setup:
  
The webserver virtual host and php for NextCloud are running on a low permission user. That means that even if your server gets hacked for some reason, your server is still fine since they can't touch the root user.
 LSPHP seems to be faster than php-fpm by default and we are using it.
 APCU and redis are being used to boost the performance to the best
 Debian 11 was used to stability and security
 I show you how to easily use occ commands with this setup in the end
 This guide is 100% free.
 I doubt that you will ever find a faster NextCloud. I feel that this setup may be faster than some managed NC hosts out there
  
Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions here or on the comments section :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 So, currently I have 2x4TB on a mirrored ZFS pool but I need more space. I'm just not sure where to go from here. I could get another 4TB drive and go for raidz1 but is that a good idea? Should I just get two and mirror it? Or is raidz1 enough with a good backup? I currently only backup super important data encrypted to cloud storage (Hetzner Storage Box) but haven't thought about a good backup for all the data. raidz1 doesn't seem to have a good reputation but I'm not sure how warranted that is for data that is mostly blurays where I have the physical disk anyway.
 So, do I get 1 extra disk for ~7TB storage and one disk for parity and a large external drive for nightly backups? Do I get two for stripped and mirrored? I'm not really sure...
 BTW the two disks I have are SRM. I read about the SRM/CRM WD Red thing too late. The new disk(s) would be CRM. There have not been any issues writing data yet. So I thought about just replacing the two SRM drives with 2 8TB crm drives but that seems like a dumb financial decision...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a member of an online-only Dungeons and Dragons group. We - the players - need to organize our campaign notes in a searchable, categorized, and user-friendly way. 
 Currently I store all of my own notes in Vimwiki, and another player uses Notepad. A third won't take notes at all as it's too much work. 
 I've considered things like mediaWiki but that seems like a lot. I've looked at Joplin, but, again, a lot. Again, I discounted these almost entirely because they seem like way too much for what I'm trying to do. I'm still willing to consider them if there's a good reason to.
 I'd ideally like something that:
  
can be reverse proxied
 only requires one container
 either supports multiple users or has no concept of users
 has a dark more or Dark Reader doesn't make it look terrible
 has edit history
 has multiple pages/categories/something; one page per area in the campaign or something
  
In a perfect world it would fit all these criteria, but I think I'd bargain down to it fitting three.
 Any ideas?

 Pi-Hole doesn’t play nice with Pop!_OS, so I’m switching to Ubuntu Server.
 NextCloud and Plex storage will be on an external array once I get the funding together.
 I’ve heard that Pi-Hole can have issues in a container, so I may just run it bare.
 If any Linux admins here have any tips, tricks, or best practices to follow to help make setting things up as smooth and easy as possible, I’d appreciate it! 
 I’m a little fuzzy on migrating the Homebridge and Home Assistant containers, but I welcome any useful suggestions!

 I have been noticing some issues with my plex server and decided to run some tests on all my equipment. I was checking the status of my HDD, and I first used Crystal disk info, which gave me a caution message, I then downloaded the Western Digital Dashboard, and it says it's healthy, I then ran an extensive 6+ hour smart test, and no errors came up. This left me needing clarification and guidance and wondering what program to trust. I later found out about HD Tune and tried that, and it matches what Crystal Disk stated. Is it safe to say I have a dying HDD? It is still under warranty, so I am considering claiming an RMA and shipping it out. What do you all think I should do?

 This is the health status from the Western Digital Dashboard

 I am running a small Docker Swarm with 4 RPi. I really love all the services I am able to run at home.
 But I have encountered some issues in the past and today as well. But I didn't understand exactly what the issue is.
 I have a Synology NAS and a NFSv4 Share which is mounted on each RPi. Usually I create BIND mounts when I set up a service. I had this issue with Nextcloud and today with a Ghost container: During preparation phase, I checked the logs and always found: "changing ownership: permission denied" for the BIND mounts I've defined.
 Can someone explain me what's the issue here? 
 Big THX!

 Does anyone know of an alternative that I could use self-hosted? I'd also be willing to explore a way for a server like Cleavr to connect to my internal server.. I setup Cloudflare tunnel at first and then remembered that it doesn't support inbound connections through SSH hahah

 After reading all the horror story posts on here of people having services exposed to the internet and waking up to a ransomware encrypted NAS I closed off my entire lab to the internet and now use Tailscale more or less exclusively to access servers. It works great, but it's not perfect - particularly, the iOS app uses a ton of battery.
 My ideal setup would be to expose a single SSL reverse proxy that requires Google auth. That would not only allow secure remote access without Tailscale
 Feels possible - has anyone made this work?

 Then on the last step of registering an account they want pretty much all of my details, like home address, full name, tax ID, phone number and so on ...
 Is that really necessary?
 I would want to register with my e-mail and password then checkout with Paypal. I do donate from time to time to open source devs for their hard work, but this is just ridiculous.
 Maybe I missed something like a legal obligation in the country they operate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing some reading on this subreddit and a couple other subreddits trying to iron out my data/backup solutions for the new year. I found a few trails of thinking that backing up to a single disk, primarily an external is nearly, or if not worse, than not at all. This is stemmed from the idea of data corruption, mainly, by not having a filesystem like ZFS or BTRFS with checksumming in an array to fix bitrot, coupled with potential problems with USB devices. 
 While I'm sure there may be more wiggle room, and it probably is fine to have a couple extra backup drives (cold storage etc) as single disk/USB, but if you're main backup device is USB, it does start to make sense. 
 For instance, I've got a Synology 1621+ with 4 disks in an SHR1 array, with BTRFS and checksumming, cool. That device is used as my centralized datastore, so I should back it up locally, at least the data that I care about losing. I would need, at least, another two disks to have an array with parity and a checksumming filesystem for this to be a valid local backup (not just cold storage, but automated local backup). This doesn't take into account the offsite backup. 
 It also brings up another topic for me is cloud solutions, and maybe leaning on them a bit more due to the natural resiliency and such to make sure bitrot doesn't occur. This could be fed back into my local solution, and then backed up offsite to a more archival solution. 
 Does anyone have any insight or suggestions for this so I can actually start making headway?

NAS isn't an option for me at the moment since Christmas gifts drained me. Would it be feasible to leave my computer running 24/7?

 Homepage is https://silverbullet.md that also doubles as a test instance.
 It is a markdown system, sort of a wiki, that can be edited live.
 What in my opinion sets it apart is the possibility to do some nice and structured queries on the content, like "list all the open tasks I have in all my notes".
 Reminds me of org.mode in emacs.
 Can be selfhosted easily (through docker) and is really lightweight.

 I would like it to have a bank of knowledge, for example say I downloaded a Wikipedia article bundle on biology, I could a say "computer, what is the purpose of RNA". I would also like it to do normal functions like calling people, setting reminders etc
 How would one set something like this up with minimal effort (I don't have extensive knowledge on coding so I don't think I could code one from scratch) on my phone? Perhaps something like this already exists?

Right now I am pushing to S3 all of my grandpa’s documents, he has a lot of them as he takes pictures and writes history books. I’m visiting him for the holidays and I thought it would be good to do a backup of his computer. I also thought it would be good to share this idea with you, my fellow hoarders. So do a good deed and help your family with our passion :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I'm releasing MinMon v0.3.1. I used some of the feedback I got from you guys (thanks!) for the first release not too long ago.\ Contributions and feedback are very welcome!
 There are two new checks: - PressureAverage which checks Linux Pressure Stall Information (PSI) for CPU, I/O, and memory. - ProcessExitStatus which runs a process and checks its exit status code. This gives a lot of flexibility to implement custom checks. 
 There are a few incompatible changes: - The default value for "memory" in the MemoryUsage check config was changed from true to false. - The placeholder alarm_id has been renamed to check_id for more consistent naming.
 Happy holidays!

I’ve never used a tape library so I figured it would be fun to learn on for the price, and maybe if I’m lucky upgrade the drive to a newer version. It’s a Tandberg Storage Magnum 2x24, holding 24 tapes for a whopping ~10TB active storage, now all it needs is a good clean. :)

I'm honestly not sure if this is something I can pull off to be quite honest. For several years I've been running a few things on a Synology NAS (DS920+). Basically right now I'm running Jellyfin and Omada controller in Docker on the Synology. I've read a lot of interesting stuff about other stuff like Proxmox. I got some crazy idea I wanted to do that so I got a Dell T5810 workstation with a 24c/48t processor and (so far) 64 GB RAM. The DS920+ is getting re-homed so what I want to do is use my old Synology, the DS413, as network storage with my T5810 running Proxmox. So far I think I have it set up properly with I think its called NFS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, hi everyone. I have only today stumbled across your beautiful subreddit and have already spent hours on it. This is a Christmas gift in itself. I am absolutely going to implement this 3-2-1 storage method, but before I do:
 I have had a query (title) for years and it is getting to the stage where my devices are dying and I NEED a solution.
 I have attempted to transfer images and videos from an iPhone to a USB stick via a laptop before in the past but when transferring from an iPhone to a Windows laptop I noticed some videos/images were left out, despite me standing over the transfer for HOURS. Does anybody have a tried and trusted solution for this situation? If it works for this, it will probably work for all my other files stored locally on my laptop too.
 This will be for cold storage. I have read that HDDs perform better than USBs for this, is anybody able to verify that?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically want 1 machine with virtualization to run about 5 or so VMs. My old virtual lab Windows Pro w Hyper V tower is pretty old and noisy, and probably too outdated at about 10 years old. My daily machine is now a MacBook pro m1 with 8GB RAM, so not a lot of room for VMs there.
 Want one machine, don't want to get into a lot of equipment. Don't want it to be "always on", and don't care about HA. Prefer quiet hardware as I would probably put it in my home office. I could put something in my basement but I imagine it would be a hassle turning it on remotely, since I don't want always on. Most familiar with Windows Hyper V or VMware, but am open to other options.
 Reason for lab is to test ansible/Jenkins/terraform (among others) development to Windows and Linux guests (VMs), and also some Active Directory too. 
 Does someone have a similar setup, or any general suggestions of how to spec out something like this, what the options are?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys - Looking to upgrade the core switch in my network. Needs to be one single switch that has decent fan curves so my wife doesn't go crazy (1U is the only space we have in our closet).
  
Need at least 8x mgig 2.5/5/10 Gbps ports that support POE (POE for Wifi6E APs)
 Need at least 8x 1GbaseT ports that support POE
 4x SFP+ ports (uplink to 10G router and servers)
 2x QSFP+ ports (not required but would be nice for upgradability)
  
Right now the only one I've found is the Meraki MS355 but the licensing fees really turn me off. The product stops switching if the license expires and I'm unsure of the fan noise.
 I believe Cisco has variants in the 9300 series but I'm very nervous about the fan noise.
 Any other recommendations?
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I'm at my wits' end. I am new to actual servers because I usually just use old PCS, but I recently got an R220 server off eBay. This server will sometimes randomly restart and will sometimes randomly power off. The memory scans good with memtest and all other hardware appears to be okay. The weird thing is that I don't think it is actually shutting windows itself down. I left a notepad file up on the server as a test to see when it shuts down, but when I power the server back up the notepad file was still open. I also don't see anything in event viewer. It looks like it is maintaining the last OS state somehow. Through Googling I found out that it might be related to iDrac, but I don't know enough about what that is to know for sure. I did go ahead and update iDrac and the BIOS though and that didn't fix it. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i've had my gaming laptop for a couple years now. after losing my mod folder for one of my favorite games (~16GB) last year, i began keeping a backup on my second internal ssd. i recently scored a surprisingly cheap pre-built gaming desktop and finally got around to transferring my mods over there.
 a small problem i encountered was my flash drive was slightly too small to move the now 28.6GB folder. i have a second flash drive handy so i just split the folder in half to complete the transfer. this has now lead me down a small rabbit hole of trying to find a convenient way of both keeping the folders on both PCs identical while also having a backup not connected to either. 
 i have an old 120GB ssd that i think still works. in the morning i plan to run to best buy and acquire either an enclosure or a sata-usb adapter cable or dock to utilize this ssd as a short term transfer/backup drive. 
 moving forward, i'd like a better setup for backing up and transferring all my game files as needed. not overly fond of using a NAS as it seems overly expensive and and honestly overkill for my use case (plus i'd rather not have to keep it powered). i'm leaning towards a few cheap SSDs, possibly setup to be exclusive to specific games or genres.
 both computers have 1.5TB of internal storage (all NVME in the laptop, 500GB NVME and 1TB HDD in the desktop) which is also a limiting factor (steam library is currently closer to 2TB, and i plan on buying a few more large games when i get paid on friday). i'd ideally like to be able to play some of the smaller, less demanding games straight off the external drives (more minecraft and goat simulator, less skyrim and GTA5). 
 what do you experienced hoarders recommend?

 The system has a random 500GB HDD in it and a 500GB Samsung nvme drive. I installed Proxmox already to it with ZFS and both drives in raid 0 because I read that I should use ZFS because that gives snapshotting and it seems like a good thing to have. Also ZFS seemed like a good option (albeit a bit complicated) in general. Well I noticed that my NVME drive fails SMART check as it apparently has 255% of its lifetime used …]]></summary>

Just wanted to provide some context and background for why I'm asking for help/advice. Let me know if you have any questions or want any additional info about my setup/plans. Thanks! 
  
A week or so ago, I purchased an ORICO two bay USB 3 external HDD enclosure to house two 8TB WD Red Plus NAS hard drives. I had the drive bay connected to my HP ProDesk 600 G2, and then setup as a RAID 0 array via mdadm. That idea worked fine, and I was pretty happy with things. The ProDesk works perfectly fine for what I want out of a little home server, and I figured connecting some HD's via an external drive bay and creating my own little NAS storage setup would be more interesting and co…]]></summary>

 I'm hoping to buy on Amazon, probably just 32 or 64 gb. Is there anything I should pay attention to for looking for a new USB? Any types that are maybe a bit faster and reliable without being too expensive?

I believe it is due to linux doing renaming, sorry I am a newb and don't know all the terms. I plan to add an additional card so I would hate losing my internet again as I try to run this headless on proxmox.
 I am referencing this recommendation .
 I ran the following:
 journalctl -b 0 | grep renamed 
 And it states that "....enp3s0: renamed from eth0"
 What do I need to type in order to get the correct namesso that my ethernet will work again?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon, I've been reading a lot of posts here and want to keep to the 3-2-1 rule, especially as I've had a recent scare trying to hunt down data that was stored on an account that was deleted a while ago. I have 2 forms of local storage (my 1TB Windows 10 laptop and 2TB external WD easy store drive) but am now trying to figure out a good cloud solution.
 I don't have a clear estimate on how much I plan to store online, but I think around 40 GB or more might be a good approximate. I do care about my privacy though, and understand that no cloud based storage can offer me true privacy so I would need to encrypt my files before uploading. I've heard of mega.io , google drive, and tarsnap. I'd like to stay away from drive for obvious reasons.
 My question is, what is a good cloud based service for the (relatively) small amount of data I want to back up that gives me options if I want to scale up in the future, and what encryption programs should I download to encrypt my files before I upload them. Thank you.

 I have minio running perfectly fine on my home server, and would like to setup my grandparents and parents PCs to backup to my home minio. 
 Is there any good, easy to use utility for windows that would allow backup to minio? I am a good distance away and something that can run in the background would give me peace of mind for their data. 
 The minio/unraid server is also backed up to cloud. So 3 separate locations should mean the data is fairly safe from loss. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Apologies in advance if this is not the right place to post.
 Tl;dr: how to compare low consumption chips? How does a Via vx855 or vx900 compare to a Marvell ARMADA PXA 510 v7? 
 I'm only getting started with self-hosting, etc and after trying to get a rpi, I read a few posts around here recommending a thin client instead, which could potentially be cheaper, more efficient and at least as powerful (if not more) than a pi3.
 For info, my intention is to set a very simple home server so I can automate backup of my several devices, potentially self hosting nextcloud or equivalent.
 Now, my question: after reading a few posts, I went and bought off ebay (I'm in the UK in case that matters) a wyse 3010 (T10). I think it's this: https://www.wysechoice.co.uk/epages/BT4858.mobile/en_GB/?ObjectID=18010786
 Now, I haven't tested yet (Christmas and all that...) but I realised (too late, maybe?) that it's a 32bit processor, and the wyse comes without any flash storage! I know I can install Linux in a pen-drive so that's not an issue, but using the internal flash memory would be a nice addition.
 On the other hand, looking a bit more on ebay, I've found a few igel m310/320/330 for a reasonable price. They come with a chip Via Eden x2 (vx855 or vx900). All this info i found in parkytowers, which is extremely helpful but also a huge rabbit hole... And now I don't know anything anymore!
 In brief: how does a Via vx855 or vx900 compare to a Marvell ARMADA PXA 510 v7? How do these compare to an Atom e3815?
 Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to post (or the wrong way to ask!) and thanks in advance for reading and helping out!
 Ps: and merry christmas/happy new year if you celebrate in any way ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if 1TB Western Digital SA510 SSD’s would work or should I spend the extra money on SSD’s that are made for NAS use (such as the WD SA500)?
 The WD SA510’s are about 45$ cheaper (here in Canada) than the WD SA500’s. Is the extra cost worth it in the long run? 
 I plan to use Raid 10, starting with 6 SSD’s. My NAS has 10G networking, and is mostly used for media storage. 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm looking for a program that might exist that i've heard of ( or maybe i've dreamt hearing of it).
 Basically, all im looking for is a simple web app that i can configure commands for that i can run in my local network so when my partner yells "IS PLEX DOWN?!?!", they can just hit a button to send a "docker container plex restart" command to my server.
 I can probably achieve this in home assistant, but I'm trying to avoid that. I'd prefer a standalone solution of some sort.
 EDIT: Resolved. OliveTin worked perfectly and its already up and running. Took about 30 minutes to going. Thanks again to /u/alphafalcon

So let's say I install Qbittorrent and I want it to download everything to a NFS folder on my NAS, do I have to mount that folder in Turnkey? Or do I have to add that volume in Portainer? Or do I have to do both? Please help me on this.

But I am willing to pay and as an investment for my own personal learning and development server. In the long run. I know it will be less hassle to run a cluster server and it might even be cheaper but I’ll not learn anything but their own version of the tools. I have read the initial intro notes on this sites and they are useful. I am looking for additional 101 step by step materials. Thanks so much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in my mid 30's so I had my fair share of dealing with CD's back in the day. But In my mind optical media seemed to have become a completely obsolete technology by now. So I was surprised to learn about M-disc when a someone on this sub brought it to my attention as a means to archive data. 
 And it turns out that it's the only way to archive data in a way that's legitimately durable long term and immune to bitrot. The second best would be LTO Tape drives. But the drives are really expensive and then the tech is still inherently not immune to bit rot, just less so that hhd and ssd and has a shelf life of about 30 years compared to the 1000 of M-Disc. 
 So M-Disc is for anyone that wants to archive data in the most straight forward way. As in put you data on some medium that you can store away and know for a fact that some process of degradation wont be destroying it. No other storage medium can make a claim that comes even close to M-Discs durability and projected life expectancy. M-Disc literally engraves on a rock like layer so not that different from the Assyrian clay tablets that we still have from over 1000 years ago.

 ​
 I'm looking for a selfhosted Windows or Linux service that includes a web-based GUI and supports CD-ROM playback. I looked up Volumio however many people have had issues with it being a bit buggy and it is also requires a paid subscription to support CD playback. Preferably with Airplay support so I could stream lossless to my speakers through a DAC plugged into the streaming machine.
 ​
 Hardware at my disposal is:
 Dell Thin client with a Celeron, 2GB RAM and 4GB eMMC storage.
 Or a Late 2014 Mac Mini that is already running Windows in bootcamp, due to it being used as a low-power personal Minecraft server machine through AMP instance manager.
 ​
 Any suggestions? Anything I've found is usually Raspberry Pi - ARM based, and I don't have a spare one on hand, all of them are running their duties already.

 I would like to to create a self signed CA to sign certificates for websites on my local network only as for anything outside is behind my reverse proxy with Lets encrypt certbot. The problem is if i import my self signed certificate on Win11 machine all browsers return that website has no trusted certificate. Am i doing it wrong or is there some sort of trick to this? Certificates/CA generation is a bit confusing for me from the technical side of things. 
 Is there a tool that would help me generate a CA/self signed ssl certificates and import them or do i need to do everything by hand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm building an app to manage some files, and I've determined it makes the best sense to use object storage.
 I would like to host internally on my home k8s cluster to start/while I'm developing, using my NFS NAS as the actual storage backend.
 Are there any self-hostable solutions out there that can slap an S3 API in front of some NFS? Minio seems really heavyweight for my use case, plus they explicitly don't support network filesystem backends. The only other potential solution I've found is Zenko Cloudserver, and frankly, it looks like a development mess. 
 Would appreciate any insight if anybody has discovered other solutions.
 //edit: to clarify, when I say simple, ideally I’m looking for something that just maps the API to files on the filesystem. Minio is great, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t need the whole HA/duplication/everything else it provides for my local needs. I just need to be able to make API calls and retrieve files. 
 Thanks!

 this is the seventh update (December 2022) we're doing on the WH lore and thanks to the feedback received we managed to archive:
 - an improved sorting
 - added new released books
 - replaced/deleted many non-retail
 ALL the books have been renamed with Author's Name Surname - Book title (Series) for an easy search.
 The retail tag means how the book was ripped
 [Retail] - Books that i have bought myself and i have removed the DRM thru calibre
 (Retail) - Books shared by other users whom DRM has been remove correctly thru calibre
 (retail) - Books shared by other users who purchased the books but not drm'ed correctly with calibre
 With this I'm hoping to give the reader a complete collection of WH books in their best available format and somehow well sorted.
 If you enjoyed this and found some issues such as typos, bad scans/conversions, misplaced books and pretty much anything please send me a message.
 Lastly a huge thanks goes to all the people that helped out with this project. Thank you!

 I'm going through my spare parts bins and junk that I have access to, and have come up with this so far:
 x56 ASUS P6T mobo
 i7 920 CPU -or- Xeon x5690 (probably go with the X5690)
 24Gb matching GSkill Ripjaw DDR3 1600 RAM (not ecc obvs)
 big ATX case
 I took an ancient Geforce GTX 480 off the mobo, and have several smaller GPUs to use, MUCH less power consumption than this GTX480. Surprisingly the GTX480 works great, but its a power hog for sure! I suppose I could easily go headless, once the server is up and running anyway.
 I'm hoping to do something you all probably think is simple enough, but I'm new to this stuff.
 I'd like to run Proxmox - virtualization is cool. I've loaded it once or twice on a few SSDs I've got, and just getting used to it a bit. I'm not sure how but Pro…]]></summary>

 I know that you can't increase quality by converting a lossy file to a lossless file, but can you prevent it from losing any more quality? These are sentimental files and I'm wondering if they'd be better preserved as .flacs

 It's been four years since I made this post, where I acquired a drive holding a 2014 dump of animemusicvdieos.org including an export of it's database. I'm gonna be honest here... It's collected dust since. I've made a few attempts to upload it to Archive.org via FTP but I just get errors. Tried different PCs and FTP clients, I start getting hung transfers and it all goes to hell. This is a huge amount of data so it's not like I can just toss it on Gdrive.
 So I'm looking for other people who can help. People I can send this data too and hopefully they can upload to archive.org and share by other means if they want. This drive won't function forever, I really need to get around to duplicating it's contents and propagating it across the internet and into other individual's collections.
 Ideas?

 I like to just go to google drive and drag all the files into a folder and let them upload. Problem is, there are many. When I do this, google never asks me if I want to replace the files or whatever. It always just reuploads the files that already exist and adds a number to the end of the name.
 Is there any way to stop this so that it does not upload file with the same name?

 Now I have come to the decision to switch to a self-hosted password manager.
 I am currently a little afraid that my current one might be hit at some point.
 I currently use 1Password and would like to switch to the self-hosted version of Bitwarden.
 What do you think, is it worth it and do I have to worry about security?
 I know a lot about securing Linux servers, so I think I'm relatively safe, but what do you think?
 Where should I host, can you recommend a secure hoster that is also trustworthy?
 I am currently thinking about using Hetzner, Ionos or AWS.
 If possible the hoster should be located in Germany.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks,
 So I have Jellyfin and Tailscale installed on my home desktop. I also have Tailscale installed on a Google Compute Free Tier VM and have enabled it as subnet router. The home machine with Jellyfin installed is set as an exit node. I am able to ping my Google VM Tailscale IP from home machine and ping home machine from the VM.
 My question is, how do I access Jellyfin through the internet using my VM? Basically, I want to access without using Tailscale client(because there may be instances where I cant install the client on a device)..
 I have verified I can access my Jellyfin server through other devices on my home LAN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got ESXI 6.7 running on a dell precision T5600 (Dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690) that has the onboard SAS port / controller. I have a 1 TB 2.5 inch SSD as the boot drive for ESXI 6.7 and a 2 TB HDD for VMs. I've recently installed an ICY DOCK Tray-Less 4 x 2.5 SATA HDD Hot-Swap Docking Enclosure in the 5.25" Bay directly beside the disk drive and used a Cable Matters Internal Mini SAS to SATA Cable to plug into the SAS port of the system and fan out to the 4 ports on the hot swap bay. 
 ​
 However, I'm not getting ESXI to see any drives connected in the hotswap bay. while in the bios I'm able to see the one test drive I have connected and I verified the drive is functional in my main computer. Current configuration I have for the bios is that I have SATA/RAID enabled and AHCI set, I have also installed the megarid sas drivers into esxi but still no luck. Has anyone tried this before, is the bios on the T5600 a SAS or SATA type deal where only one port type works?

 Running two 2696V4's on a Shangzhaoyuan C612 chipset mobo...
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9FY9YK5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
 Everything works great, however, OCCT and HWINFO show both CPU Package powers capped at 23Watts. PSU we're using is a, 1300W EVGA G2.
 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COIZTZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 I've messed around with BIOS settings and edited C-States and what not, I got a net gain on benchmarks/Prime95/OCCT/Furmark from 20W capped to now a 30W capped. Throwing WHEA errors on HWINFO/OCCT.
 I have two separate EPS rails per socket power. CPU1, CPU2. EVGA's rails rate "108AMPS/120Watts" per 12V rail, not sure if I'm reading that right... or am I missing something here in BIOS, or on the board itself?
 I've used this power supply to push 300 watt CPU package spikes on a 5950X with PBO curves, I don't think it is the PSU?
 Maybe the board just isn't able to report actual power draw, I'm not sure.
 Fixed WHEA error 19, but no change in actual draw. Running Stress/OCCT/Cinebench/Prime95 over the course of two days everything looks fine otherwise.

 Plug it into the computer, pull up disc management. 
 And promptly formatted the wrong drive. Poof. Around 15tb of movies and tv shows.
 The only backup is a list in meta media manager of the movies. 
 Plex should be able to tell me what tv shows I had.
 I should be able to recover everything, but man some of those shows/seasons were low seeded and took forever.
 The best part? The 16tb red drive won’t initialize. And I bought it from newegg.

 I've tried looking around but all I've found are monthly charges or just not what I'm looking for. 
 My close friends and family game together, record moments, draw art and share/edit them. 
 I would super appreciate any suggestions or advice you guys have. Please keep the topic on what software would be the best for what I'm looking for and not patronizing about security or judgment of character.
 Features I'd really like:
  
Ability to use it through File Explorer like OneDrive.
 Free.
 Fancy bells and whistles like profiles, monitoring, passwords(?), history and ability to Quota the storage into sections, etc.
  
​
 Features that're a must:
  
Users are able to upload, download, delete, edit any files & pictures/text documents and what not as well as stream and play clips FROM my server without having to download them.
  
I am also open to huge one-time payment but I'm not looking for anything with monthly payments.
 The server has windows 11 pro, 128GB of dedotated WAM and 10TB of ssd storage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using Google Calendar and Trello, but it always feels a bit awkward. I'd like to write down events (and event series, ideally) and have a bit of automation with the todo list, like creating a certain todo list element at the start of the month or stuff like that.
 Is there anything good?

The first time the drive clicked was when I was freshly installing windows 10 on it for the first time with the media creation tool, At first I thought nothing of it as the installation went without a hitch, However after installing a few games and playing them, The drive suddenly clicked in rapid succession which caused a BSOD, Windows 10 was able to boot again but that's where it all went downhill as the clicking never went away till to this day of me writing this, Sometimes it doesn't click for a day or two but I will ultimately reoccur again, As it clicks most of the time when the drive is in heavy use, I have originally thought that It was the hard drive's APM feature acting up that was causing this issue, That's why I followed this Youtube video guide on how to permanently disable the APM feature within the drive(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4UrnP38T0w) But alas, It's all futile, As the clicking of the drive still persists, The drive is still usable and still in perfect health(surprisingly). What on earth could be causing this?

 First: Why?
 Well, a low power node to run the network's essentials is never a bad thing, and I didn't wanted to go for a RaspberryPI, because it's both expensive for what it is at the moment due to shortages, and also because I prefer to reduce the number of different environments I'm running, just for cohesion.
 Though, as a piece of tech from 2017, it sure needed fresh thermal paste. Thankfully, they are quite easy to open and clean. 1 screw under the back sticker, clips all around, 4 screws on the cooler (1 on the back of the board into the cooler, 3 from the front into the chassis), and the fan is just clipped in the removed panel.

 Second: How?
 Well sure, the compute stick only have wifi and bluetooth, and rely on proprietary blobs I can't (or am too lazy to) find, …]]></summary>

It's made by seagate and it's one that needs to be plugged into the wall.

 I read that this kind of USB cases are more prone to errors compared to SATA disk connected diractly to the motherboard. Is it true? If yes, there is some way to avoid it without using ECC RAM?

Either way after ii noticed all my network drives had been disconected, both from my windows laptop, and my android phone, i tried reverting the passowrd just to be sure, but it didn't work

 Example of shared drive
 Windows Defender firewall
 All and all, i'm out of ideas,
 i should mention that if i set those same settings on my laptop, and share one of its folders, my server can easily find it in the network, and mount it with no problem, but not the other way around
 any ideas?
 given that a good chunk of the time i'm messing with files on the server, is working with video files, this is really bothersome
 (last note, that same day all of that happened, i opened the computer management app, but i changed absolutely nothing in there, i only clicked on the Users and profiles tab > Users, after that i changed absolutely nothing in said "users" folder) 
 this will probly turn out to be revelant, so

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m currently looking for a software solution to host a file download site on a companies Intranet. I noticed that searching for the phrase “Download” on the Internet is a bit tricky ^^
 My requirements are:
  
The Server will have no connection to the Internet
 No Sync option like a cloud is required
 All visitors can download all released files from a web page
 Registered users can upload and manage their files via a web interface
 User can create groups and sub-groups and assign files to this groups
 Files cannot downloaded directly. Instead, the download has to be conducted via a Page for the File on which predefined text fields are shown (e.g., License, Creator, Uploader, Version-No, Contact Data etc.). Also, one or more preview pictures can be displayed.
 The download page allows to download different files (e.g. the same Bitmap in different file formats).
  
I hope for some advice on this, because finding software for this is really a pain in the neck. Thanks, in advanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got myself an early Christmas present and put together a NAS inside a Define R6 case. I threw in a 10Gb NIC (Intel X520) to speed up transfers from my main PC. Airflow isn't bad, but it's not as good as you'd find in a server chassis - especially over the PCIe area.
 https://preview.redd.it/2ra57acm6u7a1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feab3bcbd1f9e114c8751e146ed1ea717587a8ab
 After being powered on for only a few minutes I noticed the NIC was getting extremely warm with the heatsink being too hot to touch. I took a look with a thermal camera and it was by far the warmest part in the system. The heatsink was too reflective to get an accurate temperature but the back of the board was around 70°C.
 https://preview.redd.it/30h3qgq3eu7a1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=255f5483a9e963f844a931bae48c8316dbe6948b

 I took a look at the X520's datasheet and it requires a minimum air flow of 100LFM. I don't have anything to measure this, but I don't expect I'm even close. I can't see anywhere good to mount a fan nearby, but I might be able to go wild with some zip ties and make something work. I'd be interested to know what people have done to keep their NICs cool in cases they're not designed for. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at hard drives for my first nas build and saw that many people seem to be using Ironwolf Pro drives. Since I plan on using the nas as a media drive only for movies and such, should the basic Ironwolf be enough or should I opt for the Ironwolf Pro? I would like to clarify that I’ll be getting a 2 bay unit only since I’m just starting out and only intend to use it for movies atm. I can always upgrade the unit later but I was wondering if I’ll see a significant difference between the Ironwolf and Ironwolf Pro with the differences in transfer rate, cache, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been thinking about setting up my own Raspberry Pi 4 server. I want to use those services: pihole (certainly), duplicati2 (or something similar, certainly), FreeNAS/Nextcloud/Syncthing (one or two of them certainly), OpenVPN/WireGuard (maybe). I wanted to buy Raspberry Pi4 and connect 2 HDDs by USB3 to provide needed storage. I was quite certain Raspberry Pi 4 is a good idea, but the prices of 4 and 8GB editions are very high.
 Now there is those VisionFive2 that has better specs and much lower prices, but uses RISC-V processor. It's going to support Debian. Will the soft I mentioned work on it? Is it a good idea to use VisionFive2 instead of Raspberry Pi4 for such usecases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I would like....
 I have a relatively large academic text library in PDF, as well as the typical mobi (have kindle), epub, and even .lit (from my old surface pro days) ebook library. I would like a server that has persistent read state and ability to highlight/annotate/export annotations from the file. I would also like multi-user access.
 ​
 What I have tried.....
 Have been running calibre with calibre-web front end, which I don't mind and find the UI ok. The ability to track read status and custom column support in calibre-web is great. It's really only single user however when it comes to read states, etc. Also there is not persistent position in place.
 I have downloaded Kavita and it seems a lot closer to what I want (decide readers, syncs states, multiple user), but the metadata is horrible to non-existent for PDFs. Also when updating the container it wants to try to re-create the database each time for some reason.
 I have also tried audiobookshelf (have moved to this for audiobooks from plex/prologue). The audiobookshelf interface is great. They have ebook support in experimental which puts it beside/embedded with the audiobook, but the readers are horrible. I can just download the epub and send to my kindle or download the pdf (from web, not iOS app unfortunately), and could just upload the pdf back to audiobookshelf when completed.
 ​
 Are there any other options out there that I am missing? I have seen Koodo-reader but seems a bit early. Audiobookshelf or Kavita are developing but still not quite there yet. Calibre-web is closest (but really only single user), but still locked into calibre backend for sorting which I hate.
 Honestly considering just scrapping it and using a folder of sorted files for the time being.

 To close out the year, we shipped Convoy v0.8. This is such an exciting update for us; we shipped many updates we are proud of and excited to share with the community. You can just read on to learn more.
 Subscriptions Filtering
 Subscriptions Filtering is the act of subscribing for events based on the structure of the payload. It is one of our most exciting features. With this, webhook consumers can filter events they receive based on the payload. This includes two types of filters, from simple filters (exact object match) to complex matches (like $or, $in etc.) It would be best if you headed over to our docs to see a complete reference.

 It would be cool to have an app that made it easier to search and go through content. I'd like to be able to tag similar things instead of relying only on using folders. I'm imagining something like Plex where there is a database of information and you can browse or search.
 I've heard of stash but don't have any experience with it.
 Two additional challenges:
  
Most of my content are videos posted online, so these aren't like official released media. There probably isn't an easy database that exists with all the info. I assume I'd have to build that db myself.
 For privacy's sake, I keep all of the data encrypted with VeraCrypt. I am not tied to this solution, but I do want to restrict access, ideally at the file storage layer (but not required). So any solution either has to work directly with some form of encrypted storage, or as part of starting up needs to be able to mount and then access storage otherwise decrypted and made available (maybe something with ZFS?). 
 App ideally also requires authentication to access.

I’m trying to see if I got a counterfeit card so I can file a dispute for one of them. I was looking at the product ID and I can’t find it anywhere.

As you can see by the image at the imgur link, they're showing "No Fault" on SMART status. I've seen plenty of weird compatiblity issues, but this one is entirely new to me. Controller is running latest firmware, BIOS has also been upgraded to latest. The drives are firmware 7FA6, and the previous drives I had installed were of the OEM Hitachi Enterprise 2TB SAS variety.

 To add to the weirdness, when I first boot into the controller, they display as "Ready". Only after I try to add them to a VD do they go to "Failed" status.

 What are your experiences managing it ?
 Is there some cool alternative out the that could be lighter ? :)

For fun... I setup a copy of a docker container I am proxying traffic to through to NPM but, instead of using NPM with the copy I modified the local web server and added my self-signed and that works. No more errors. I didn't change the certificate in my trusted certs on my PC to make this work just didn't use NPM.
 I have no idea what I am missing. I've turned on all the radio buttons as needed ET CETRA.. Really kind of lost at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just acquired a 45Drives AV15 server. Currently, I have a Synology ds1813+ with 8x3TB WD Reds. I want the AV15 to replace the ds1813, but I need to get a 16TB to back up the Synology data first. Once I do that, I want to develop the best ZFS design for the av15 based on my current needs. So I’ll have 12x3TB WD Reds and 3x1TB SSD drives that I can use. My current setup is as follows. 
 Synology ds1813 Shares folders Media streaming (jellyfin) Music, airsonic Photos, dsphoto app ISO files and other data stored in the ds1813 VMBackups VMdata (stores some light lxd and vms disk)
 Lenovo m920q. (Proxmox host) VMs and Docker containers are running on it. Backup all proxmox VMs to VMBackups NFS shared
 The plan is to do a hyper-converged on the av15 with proxmox and the Huston gui. I’m new to ZFS and looking for advice on the design of the zpool or pools. 
 Possible considerations Scenario 1 1. zpool with 12 HDD and 3 SSD 1. Two or three VDEV (raidz1,2,3)? 1. Store everything on the zpool
 Scenario 2 1. zpool for the SSD only (raidz1 or mirror) 1. Store VMs on ssd pool 2. Zpool for the HDD (add third SSD for cache)? 1. 2 VDEV raidz1,2? 2. Store media on HDD pool
 Everything will be back up to the 16TB I’ll use to copy the data from the Synology temporarily. 
 Thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated. 
 Thanks Dan

 I have been working for a while in deploying a communitarian network in the rural region of Gandiol, Senegal, and I have been looking for a self-hosted messaging app like Whatsapp or Telegram. The main goal would be to have the following features:
  
Text message exchange among individuals and groups.
 Image/Video exchange.
  Audio/Video call support.
  
A solution I already found, looked promising but does not really end up working well, is to use rocket chat + jitsi. Instead of fighting to make this work properly, does anyone have some knowledge of any application that covers the features I mentioned before? Ideally would be an application that only do that, would like to avoid something more complex like Mattermost.
 Thanks everyone in advance and any idea is welcome :)

I am using an asrock h370m itx that I plann to pair with an i3 9100 in a Jonsbo N1 with 5 HDDs for storage and 1 Sata SSD as a boot drive. In the future I could also add an nvme as a cache.
 As I understand, TrueNAS Core does not support docker as it is based on FreeBSD. TrueNAS Scale, however, does. So now I am torn between using Proxmox to setup a TrueNAS VM for my NAS use and a Linux VM for my docker/home server use.
 What option makes more sense? This is my first time building a home server that isn't just running Linux so I'm a little lost.

 I want to host a single file on my Raspberry Pi 4 using docker and nginx, such that when I go to subdomain.domain.tld it can retrieve the file contents stored on the local SD card on the RPi4. The file is an RSS file in XML format.
 How can I do this in the easiest way possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the old part of town with frequent power outages. Unmonitored situation with 8 computers. Get about 2 years out of the original batteries but the SLA quickly lose capacity since they are totally discharged every time the power goes out. Then when we are at work the UPS are only useful for power blips and brownouts. The the power goes out we only get 5-10 min actual run time. I expect this situation will improve with the LiFeP04 and the overall cost will be much lower. Even deep cycle SLA do not tolerate frequent full discharges so that technology is not useful to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Spun up a Mediawiki install on a Debian server today, and I'm absolutely stumped trying to get this to work behind a reverse proxy. If I go to the IP of the server/wiki, it works fine, but if I go to the subdomain that I configured for this - pointed at my nginx proxy manager docker container that is handling SSL for me - it loads the default apache page instead.
 I tried specifying a custom location in the proxy host of "/" with the forward being 192.168.1.54/wiki/, and that just gives me the Apache 404 page.
 I've changed the $wgServer parameter in LocalSettings.php to be wiki.mydomain.com.
 I'm not sure if I should be looking at the apache configuration on my server, or additional parameters in nginx...
 I also tried editing the default config file in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ to point to /var/www/html/wikias that's where the PHP files are located for Mediawiki, and restarted apache. No luck.
 Does anyone have a similar setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 There have been many posts here on this topic, but after reviewing most of them I emerge perplexed. What I like about Pastebin is the ability to login and see your past pastes. I also like the ability to modify or even delete posts. Obviously, it is multi-user, but that is not needed in the homelab.
 The options that I have considered are LenPaste and Privatebin, but both seem to have a concept of creating a paste that has no editability or even in some cases visibility after creation. (For example, neither seem to allow edit or deletion of pastes after creation.) I think that the they do this to ensure privacy and security, but I prefer something more Pastebin like even if it requires a security trade off.
 I am confused about why these seemingly basic features are nowhere to be found in OSS pastebin alternatives. Am I missing something? Are there other options that I should be considering that have these features?
 TIA!

Since I want to avoid Molex-to-SATA adapters, is it possible to connect a 6-pin to 4x SATA (EVGA) to the 6-pin PERIF connector (PSU side)? Looking around, I found that the only difference is the absence of the 3.3v pin. Am I right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using this rsync command on my new debian/openmediavault server in order to get all data moved from the old one onto this one:
 rsync -hazP --stats -e "ssh -T -c aes256-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x" root@10.10.10.15:/srv/27829c9c-dbc1-4408-a111-56dbcd8f0ec0/media/ /srv/mergerfs/norman_pool2/media
 In both instances, the data is in a unionfs or mergerfs pool. 10.10.10.15 is the IP of the NIC on the source server which should make it communicate over 10Gb only since that port is plugged into the 10Gb NIC on the new server with a DAC cable. The only other interfaces are the main 1GB NICs which each have a line going to my router/switch
 The new server is intel I3 12100 with 32GB ram, the old is Dell R710 with dual xeon L5664 CPUs and 32 GB ram. They both show low CPU utilization and ram utilization during the process, but I'm not seeing more than 15MB/s on larger files, 5-10MB on smaller ones. I think the highest I've seen is 18MB/s which seems insanely slow for a direct 10Gb connection
 Is there anything I'm not thinking of, or anything the command could use to speed things up even more

 So far it seems like the only 4u case that does not break the bank a lot is the RSV-L4000U from Rosewill . Is it a good choice? Are there any other recommendations? 
 Also seems like the prices are currently elevated (supply chain issues still?) Any guidance on if waiting a bit longer would bring sanity to the prices? I've read that the Rosewill RSV-L4000U used to be around $130 not too long ago.

 I'm guessing this may be related to the fact I'm using "Nginx Proxy Manager" to make it so I can use this alongside my smarthome system I'm self hosting. Home Assistant. I'm not super confident I've set up that correctly. I followed a different tutorial to get that set up and I'm guessing there's just a minor configuration difference. 
 During the mastodon tutorial I did skip the SSL Certbot step, since the Nginx proxy manager was already handling the SSL part, and I'm guessing this is where I screwed up. 
 Here's the configuration options I tried in the Nginx proxy manager and what happened each time.
 What I did first, what I thought was correct based on the Nginx Proxy Manager I followed previously:
 ​
 When I did this, I'd get \"TOO MANY REDIRECTS\" error in the browser.
 As a test, I tried to set the scheme for https, with the forward port 443, I got this instead. Notice the mastodon favicon, that did not happen last time.
 And just for completion sake, here is the nginx configuration file on the server that's running mastodon: https://pastebin.com/aJZLKnhE

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I just bought a 1u server off eBay with the motherboard in title.
 It came with with everything it should need to run. The seller listed it saying it posted and that’s as far as they tested.
 When I power it on, the fans spin up for a few seconds, then it shuts off.
 I have connected the ipmi lan Port and was able to get on the ipmi web page, but the default credentials don’t work.
 When I connect my monitor, it switches on to react to the new connection, but doesn’t display anything when the server powers on.
 I have tried my gaming pc power supply connected to the main board but it does the same thing. My pc psu only has 1 8pin cpu connector and this motherboard needs 2 8 pins. 
 I tried taking the memory out to try get a beep code, but it acted exactly the same.
 There is definitely a cpu in the socket.
 Visually the motherboard looks ok. No burst caps or anything.
 Am I looking at a dead server or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a Terramaster f2-221. I'm the guy asking about single disk nas a few days ago.
 Yesterday night, while the nas was turned off, my electricity went away for a few minutes.
 Since this morning, my NAS doesn't work anymore. 
 Using tnas the NAS results as Uninitialized, if i try to connect to it's IP via browser it shows me the setup wizard, makes me create a new account and delete all previous data. If i try to connect via file manager, internet explorer, winscp or whatever it always open the setup Wizard or it asays connection refused 
 Connecting the add on pc shows several partitions, all healty, but there is no way for my pc to show the contents on the hdd, it only appears in the partition tool of windows 
 I try connecting via SSH with Putty (https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=75&t=2350), and it worked...but it said it created a new folder for my admin user (that already existed). The NAS does remember the name i've given to it tho, so i'm confused if the data is there or got partially deleted.
 Anyway, i followed this guide (https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=2575&p=13904#p13904) but, the results were completely different: no red or any colored text, only white text that more or less looks fine from my very limited knowledge, i coulnd't spot any error message 
 I literally don't know what to do apart from wiping my drive, i want to recover the data since there are still important things that i still have to back up elsewhere, and also over a terabyte of hard to find content. 
 Can anyone help me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody! 
 I have been working as a software developer for almost 10 years, and, for work stuff we always almost use cloud services.
 I love server less approaches etc, when it comes to handing a client an solution.
 But sometimes I do projects of my own, and in those cases I feel that the work becomes too much..
 Imagine just having the ability to run a Redis that allows my services to communicate, and then expose an Web App to show some data.
 So, here I am, I want to fix a home setup! 
 The main goal is running small pieces of software that I build at home, and then often expose an Web App using Node to communicate with my Services.
 Where should I start? 
 I have been looking at Synology and Qnap NAS as options, very cheap and seems really easy to get started with.
 Any recommendations and or guides to follow for this? 
 Basically my goals are
  
Run Services through Docker (Only Locally)
 Expose WebApps running Node to reach the local services
 Attach Domain Names, I guess something needs to be done for DNS, or would a simple Redirect from my DomainProvider to my IP be enough? 
  
Marry Christmas and Happy new Year

 I have created my own self hosted app (docker/python) to fill a gap in the market! A niche gap but a gap!
 Github Link : https://github.com/benkey0/ChristmasPresentChecker
 I love to make repeitive tasks slighlty easier like most of us do! Christmas presents involve lots of writing tags and lets face it tags arent fun!
 I have created a application to decode barcodes (using hardware scanner or device camera) and provide a front end solution for Christmas morning.
 You simply add sticky barcodes (printed with a thermal printer or ordered online for cheap!) onto your presents and add them into the Christmas Present Checker using the front end interface.
 Please see the below video.

 Essentialy this is my first time making something "semi-useful". I would appreciate some feedback and although its not as useful as most things shared here it may be something festive to play around with over this period!
 Merry Christmas!
 Ben

 I ended up automating part of my setup with Ansible.
 Host your stuff provides (among other things):
  
Nextcloud instance (snap)
 
Vaultwarden instance (docker)
 
SearxNG instance (docker)
 
fail2ban
 
Bunkerweb
 
Regular updates and backups for these services
 
Certs using certbot
 
 This is born from my personal use case so it's pretty much a WIP and might have some rough edges here and there.
 However I though I'd share it around in case its of use for someone else.
 There are probably 100 better ways of doing this, any feedback is welcome.

I have been trying to manage a growing number of local files, notes (notion).
 All of this has led me on a search for what I am calling an integrated storage solution, or a tool that will keep all of my files, bookmarks, and things of that nature organized. I would like to have a single file tree to manage files bookmarks notes and media. I currently use notion for my notes, and I am working on finding a way to integrate that.
 Next cloud has most of the functionality I believe I will need, and I may set up a server for it soon, but I want to see if there are any better options. I am ok with non self-hosted apps and self-hosted apps, and would prefer the software to not be a subscription (free option or one time purchase)
 Thanks for the suggestions and comments!

 Now the real question is, how would you be able to archive an entire subreddit(including the media posted). I have seen things like telegram bots but they will only archive stuff from the date they are added, not useful at all for getting stuff that's already been posted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I reached out to Synology about this but the tech wasn’t sure how to answer it.
 I use a Synology single-bay NAS and the Cloud Sync application to mirror all of my data (one root folder with all data inside) to both Backblaze B2 and Google Drive. The syncing is up to date, so Backblaze and Google Drive have copies of every piece of data I own, and further, so does a WD 16TB external drive. The really important stuff is further backed up on my PC, laptop, bluray discs, other external drives (one being at a friend’s house), Microsoft OneDrive, and Mega.io, so I’m not concerned about data loss.
 I am wondering, though, if my Synology hard drive fails permanently, is anyone here able to outline the least time consuming workflow it would take to setup a brand new Synology NAS (or new drive in the original Synology tower) to sync up with both Backblaze B2 and Google Drive the way the original Synology drive did, so that anything I add to the root folder will continue being seamlessly backed up to both cloud services as before? Since I have the a WD external drive with the entirety of my data (same exact data as on Backblaze B2 and Google Drive), could I transfer that root folder with all of my data from the WD external to the new Synology NAS, and then can Cloud Sync compare the contents between that folder, Backblaze and Google drive and consider them to be synced up without the need for mass upload / download again?
 Thank you for your time. Please let me know if I may clarify anything I’ve outlined above.

 I''m spending more time than I want in some countries I don't want to name (somewhere in Asia), where the internet is sometimes problematic to use. I'll just say that they tried to use fake ssl certs on gov level before, and from my experience they are still trying to get access to peoples data.
 There are times when Wireguard works fine, then stop connecting at all. PPTP and L2TP are the most reliable (in term of creating a tunnel) but sometimes they also won't work. OVPN the same.
 Tried tailscale and netmaker, results vary.
 What do you recommend to set up on my home server (in EU) to reliably access?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our energy bills skyrocket (even more if you're unfortunate to live in a middle of Europe), and most of us start thinking twice before adding shiny new refurbished server into our racks. I wonder how do you folks optimise energy usage for your homelab? 
 The path I went through recently began from re-thinking the purpose of all my boxes:
  
which ones need to run constantly 24h/day?
 which ones should run during a day, when most of my (and my family's) activity happens?
 which ones should run occasionally, when one needs to access concrete services?
  
Surprisingly, the answer for 1. was "none" - I don't need to keep anything running during a night and this way I also discovered I may "sleep" and "wake-up" on predefined schedule all of my servers, including Synology NAS. Proxmox behaves a bit weird (for example I can't log-in to certain nodes after wake up for some reason), but I can live with it.
 The answer for 2nd question was more tricky. Definitely NAS with couple of crucial docker containers (like paperless, dashboard) and AzuraCast are something that everyone at home uses a lot and it should run at least till 22:00. This is where I discovered that all these services are lightweight enough to locate them on single raspberry pi. 
 The answer for 3rd question was the easiest - everything else should run "on-demand". In particular things related to software dev (Gitea, Drone CI, Coolify, etc.) should start when needed. I managed to reduce required hardware to 2 boxes only - Intel NUC for Kubernetes cluster and Lenovo m720q for the rest, and move them straight onto my desk. They are extremely quiet so no feeling of sitting next to the jumbo-jet.
 I'm still curious how much does it save (maybe not worth the effort), still measuring energy usage. Along the way, I also had to re-evaluate my plans to buy Dell r720. Would be great to have those 48 threads for my hungry clojure containers, but I guess I would have to find another job to pay crazy bills :)

 I was looking for something that could hold some hard drives but I wanted to explore doing a all flash based vdev, managed to shove all of it inside this ITX case with barely any room to spare. SSDs are in raidz1, 8TBs are mirrored archival, 16TBs are in raidz1 for a redundant copy of data and things I don't care too much about. 3-2-1.
 This thing gets toasty though, the case is nice but isn't built well for airflow. I get way better performance leaving the outer shell off. It draws more power than I intended, might explore the Atom based platforms next.
 Max capacity of this this thing could be insane with ~100TB of HDD capacity, 48TB of 2.5" SSD capacity, and another 40TB of NVM…]]></summary>

 Years ago, I had a program that would show you each image, and you would select a number from 1-9, which mapped to a folder, and it was easy to speed through and quickly sort large amounts of photos. 
 Has anyone heard of software like this? I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.

 128 GB of DDR4 RAM
 DUAL (2) CPU Slots
 1 CPU with 3.5+ GHZ and 10+ Cores with multi threading
 NO GPU (its not needed, its just hosting)
 200-400 GB of storage 
 ​
 My budget is around 300-400, I've looked and found multiple parts just I can't find any that together. 
 Thanks, Nicc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently hosting all my services on my Synology NAS. I've used the built in Synology reverse proxy (which uses nginx under the hood I believe) but was beginning the transition to traefik as I needed some more customizability as I was onboarding Authentik.
 I realized that one of the main advantages of Traefik is it's docker integration. Most of my services are running via docker on my NAS. I use portainer to manage my containers.
 I've got some additional machines on order which I'm intending to move several of my services to in order to lighten the load on my NAS and increase performance.
 With the use of multiple machines, Traefik docker integration may have less of an advantage. I still intend to user docker, just will be on multiple machines. Some x86 and some ARM. Should I continue with my Traefik migration or should I switch into setting up NPM or a different alternative instead?

 Other than Plex/PlexAmp, I currently have Navidrome as my streamer and substreamer client apps on Android/iOS devices. This works great for offline caching & online streaming. The only thing missing for me and family is offline playback on WatchOS for use without phone. (Think going for a run, working out in the gym etc).
 The only subsonic API compatible app that I have come across which has Apple WatchOS support for offline playback is AVSub - unfortunately the app is quite buggy and music playback on the Watch actually stops as soon as the watch screen turns off, so basically useless.
 Is there anything else out there or do I just need to pay the man and get a Tidal subscription?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I run multiple services on a VPS, as well as a VPN.
 All of the services are exposed to the Internet and can be publically reached. Now, I would like to have certain services behind a VPN, so they are not exposed.
 How to do this?
 What do I have to do in my docker config, so that it works? And what link would I have to use to access it? Given that I am connected with my VPN, would I be able to use localhost:port?
 ​
 I am using for example the glances service. I used the following docker compose:
 version: '3' services: glances: image: nicolargo/glances:latest-full container_name: glances ports: - "61208:61208" - "61209:61209" volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro restart: always environment: - "GLANCES_OPT=-w -u user" pid: host 
 For me it is clear that I should not expose any ports. But I also dont know what else to do :)
 So all help is welcome!

 The machine currently has a 256Gb SSD and I have 2x 3Tb drives on the way. I’d like to use the Tb drives to be all of the storage for the VMs with some redundancy. 
 Can I virtualize a TrueNAS or Unraid setup on part of the drives and leave part for storage on any other machines? Part of the use case would be virtualized Plex, pointing to files on the NAS. Is this a bad idea? What are my other options without spending money on additional hardware?

 If you’re hosting, is your guest network ready? Have you tested it DHCP and DNS? Is the password posted for all to see?
 If you’re hosting, have you made sure your computer and lab are locked up and protected? Some of us have LEDs and toddlers like things to grab and bright lights. So do drunk adults. And people in general. Assume it's not safe unless locked. Locked well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, the time finally came. My "gaming PC" that was converted to a home server isn't enough anymore. I just mounted a hard drive in a cooler slot, and feel terrible about it.
 It's about time that I get a proper server rack and the components inside it.
 My use:
  
Storage. I'm now at the 10TB mark, but that's not nearly enough. Not to mention, I do not have backups for everything, just for the really important stuff.
 Jellyfin. Lots of bluray 2160p videos, the server should be capable of streaming at least 3 at a time.
 2x Minecraft Servers with mods. I noticed this isn't really heavy on my server (besides RAM usage), so I need to have some RAM available for that.
  
When built, I also want to selfhost Nextcloud, Vaultwarden and archive odd videogame ROMs, besides all of the previously mentioned.
 I cannot have a big server rack. It simply doesn't fit in my home. Maybe in the future, but for now I want something on the smaller side. I'm also not with a lot of money, so if possible, something cheap will be great :P (Used server equipment?)
 So, I need help. What do I need to buy? What do I need to understand? I'm not from the US

 I am working on the RAM spec of a Dell PowerEdge R730 with dual Xeon E5-2620 v4
 ​
 The Xeon E5-2620 v4 CPU details listed here:
 https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/sku/92986/intel-xeon-processor-e52620-v4-20m-cache-2-10-ghz/specifications.html
 ​
 Here is the CPUs memory specification:

 According to the specification, Max number of Memory Channels is 4
 Considering that I have two of the CPU, is it safe to assume that the server perform better with 2x4 = 8 modules?
 If the answer is no, how do I find the optimal number of DDR DIMMs for the server?

 The idea would be to centralize my email connections into the hosted webmail instance, and then stream the mails into my laptops and phones. Something like having a roundcube instance, with all my emails (that I can connect to on the browser), and then a desktop app (like thunderbird) that would get all that data.
 I tried cypht and roundcube, but I didn't find any way to.
 Any idea on a specific setup that could work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been struggling for the longest time with 50mbps ISP service where I’m located. I just received a door hanger yesterday from Frontier that they’re expanding fiber to my address and it looks like I’ll be signing up for their 2gig service.
 With that in mind, all of my existing networking is setup at a pretty basic level since I’ve only been working with a 50mbps service. My setup comes from my ISP source and goes into a Linksys Velop WHW03 and then into a basic 1g switch that then goes to the rest of my network. Everything is utilizing Cat5 or Cat5e. I also have an UnRaid server running on a Dell R720 that I’d like to optimize for my network traffic since I run a Plex server, Nextcloud and other services on it.
 Frontier is running a promo where they provide a free Eero 6 mesh system during setup, so I should be ok from a router/AP standpoint.
 I’m mostly wanting to know what the most optimal, budget friendly setup would be from a cabling standpoint, and what network switch I should go with. I’m wanting to do it as cheaply as possible while still making use of the upgraded ISP speeds.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a video editor and I frequently work with huge files (8K RedRaw or Phantom CineRaw etc). I’m looking for a fast storage solution that I can edit off of. I was looking at the OWC Express 4M2 which allows large capacity storage running at 2.8GBs with four drives running RAID 0. (https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TB3EX4M2/ )
 I was digging into its specs and it says it requires four drives in RAID 0 because the drives inside are limited to 700MBs due to being a 1-lane PCIe connection. 
 There are single drive thunderbolt 3/4 enclosures out there which offer similar speeds but I’m looking for large capacity along with speed. 
 Before I pull the trigger, I was wondering if there was anything else out there that could be faster that would better fit my needs?
 (Yes I realize in my hunt for speed this is probably overkill, but I’d like to do my due diligence).

I have a Synology DS920 with a handful of Docker containers on, and I have Proxmox running on a 1L USFF PC that I can put a VM, container, etc. on as needed. Both are on the same gigabit LAN. 
 The backend storage would probably end up being on the NAS either way, given the relative storage available between the two.
 Would I be better off setting up NC in Docker on the Synology, or in a VM or LXC container on the proxmox host, and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Maybe I should start with that I'm almost a complete noob at this and I'm learning it on the go so I would be grateful if you can spare me your sarcastic comments and mockery. Thanks//
 So, I have some thoughts about turning my old PC into a server. What would I need for running it smoothly? It has a 1TB SSD, i5 3.2 processor, and 16 Gb RAM. I have 2 external HDDs so I can place my data there - music, movies, etc. I can run Docker for the servers. I'm thinking about one music server - maybe Airsonic-Advanced - to remotely access my library, one movies server - maybe Jellyfin, because I can install it on my android TV, and some proxy or VPN - maybe Tailscale, because it's easy for me to set it up.
 Right now, I've installed WSL and Docker on Windows 11 (my current PC) to run my servers, but my old PC is collecting dust and laying in the closet so I'm thinking about making it like a personal server and moving my containers there. The thing is that those VM are much RAM consuming (maybe like 40%) and I have 32 Gb. Right now I'm running Tailscale on PC so the connection with the server wouldn't be much of a problem - local and remote. I've worked all my life on Windows, but I'm eager to learn new things and I think that Linux is more appropriate for those types of stuff(or at least what I'm reading from people guides and comments).
 So my question is should I continue to work on Windows - install it on my old PC and run my Docker containers on WSL again or should I install Linux and try learning it on the go? Also, what about FreeNas or OpenMediaVault? Are those systems better for the things which I want to run and would be hard for me to configure them and access them from my PC?
 Please, tell me your thoughts about this, because I'm in a dilemma about which path I should go to. Thanks in advance!

 We help our customers send webhooks by offering them a full webhook sending solution. We have a hosted version which is based on the Svix open source project.
 The open source project can be self-hosted (and many people do!), so I thought I'd share it here.
 I'd also love to take this opportunity to ask for feedback. What can we do to make it even easier to self-host Svix? You can check out the instructions on the README. I think things are fairly simple, but we would always like to improve.
 Here's the repo if you want to check it out: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks

 I recently switched from windows 10 to windows 11 which has made filehistory an even bigger mess to use so I want to look for an alternative that works better. 
 What I want to accomplish:
 Incremental back-ups (don't want it to create a full back-up everytime)
 Have it automatically back-up to my NAS
 Able to select which folders to back-up
 A nice to have would also be a filehistory way where I can go back to a version X days ago.
 Anyone have a recommendation for software able to accomplish this (preferably something lightweight)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi self-hosters,
 I've been silently following this subreddit for a really long time. First of all, thanks a ton to everyone out here. You guys have inspired me and motivated me to self-host.
 Cutting things short, my current set up looks like:
 An old Sony VAIO Laptop (i3 330m, 2+4GB RAM, 1TB 5400RPM HDD) as a Proxmox server with the following Ubuntu 22.04 LTS CT(s):
  
AdGuard Home : Primary DNS Resolver
 Radarr + Prowlarr + qBitTorrent + JellyFin : Media Server
 SnapDrop : Useful LAN File Share Utility
 ArchiveBox : Useful Web Archiving Utility
  
A Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspberry Pi OS Lite as a Backup AdGuard Home DNS Resolver (synced from Primary)
 These two together are currently serving my purposes really well, while not adding up electricity bills significantly.
 I used to host Vaultwarden and FreshRSS as well. For Vaultwarden, I do not benefit from the client-server synced up model as although I tried convincing my family, none of them uses a Password Manager. Provided it's just me and I don't really need my passwords on phone a lot, I prefer KeePassXC on my one and only Linux laptop. Same reason for FreshRSS. I used to use it with the self hosted instance of http://ftr.fivefilters.org to get Full Text RSS feeds but, I ended up feeling better with QuiteRSS. I read feeds on a single machine and full text feed isn't really a must-to-have. 
 My family is really happy with Adblocking DNS, Archiving and LAN File Share utilities and mainly because of the Jellyfin media server. 
 I'm really looking forward to add more useful tools/utilities. Please recommend some services that you self host yourself and are very useful/utilitarian in nature for you and your family. 
 (No dashboard. No Reverse Proxy like Caddy. Already considered but I'm fine without them. I've also considered the Awesome Self-Host and Sysadmin Github repositories.)
 Thanks in advance. Peace!

 For years I was only a user of open source projects, now I want to give a little bit back.
 I have created movary, a self-hosted web application to track and rate watched movies, similar to services like trakt.tv or letterboxd.com. After years of tracking my watch history with commercial services I was getting afraid what would happen if one of these services would stop providing their website or if they "lose" their databases. What about my watch history and ratings? I wanted access to this data in an easy and reliable way, so I started working on this project. It stores all used (meta)data locally, provides third party api integrations with e.g. plex and a few things more (check the README of the project).
 I think I want to release the first stable version soon and would be happy over any feedback.

 bought 2x 4tb seagate ironwolf and now after finding time to build my proxmox homelab with a truenas VM on it I noticed that one of the drives is making interesting noises. I would consider the type of noise "normal" for a hard drive but not this frequent. s.m.a.r.t test says everything is fine though. 
 They have still warranty but because I'm not an expert I wanted to ask you guys what to do maybe someone here had the same issue and there is a easier way than contacting seagate and sending the drive to them. Or maybe im just paranoid but I don't think that this is normal. 
 Many thanks in advance :)

 I have synology nas server, firefox browser in docker and openvpn-client in docker as well. Firefox works via openvpn-client.
 But now i need different instances of firefox per user; the openvpn-client container better to be the global single instance for all firefoxes, but it doesn't have to be. Also i can switch to another browser if necessary, this is not a problem.
 So, when the user connects, a new browser container should be created and then deleted when the user's session is over.
 What is the best way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading the post from yesterday about Kasm Workspaces, I've decided to try it.
 I have issues with RDP connections, none of them is working.
 Tried three different Windows machines (Win 10 variants), one local on the same VM host, one connected via LTE, 20-30 ms away (wireguard), and the third about 180 ms away (L2TP) from the KASM server.
 All of them are sitting on the loading screen, "Creating a secure connection..."
 At the same time if I fire up the Remmina workspace I can connect to all three without issues.
 Any hint what I'm doing wrong?
 Edit: I am running Kasm behind Nginx Proxy Manager, the Zone settings a set according to the manual.
 Edit 2: Made a short test. Connected with Remmina to the local Windows VM, then started the Workspace linked to the same machine.
 The expected result is to kick away Remmina client and accept the new one. After starting the Kasm client Remmina is still connected and stays like that.

So I’m thinking of getting a 10g RJ-45 PCIE NIC for each server and connecting the two via CAT6. Then configuring each NIC with an IP on a different subnet than my current LAN. If my understanding is correct, this should work right? Wanted to upgrade my entire LAN to 10g but prices of switches and other needed hardware are kinda high right now. Also only really need 10g between the two servers. I can make it happen for around $30-$50 buying used NICs on eBay. Already have the CAT6 cabling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, r/homelab,
 My ISP now offers 1.5+ gbps (3 gbps is already available, with 8 gbps coming early 2023). So that means upgrade time for my network.
 I have been looking for a 10 gbps switch/router, with a preference for a managed, L3 switch. 8+ ports (either copper of fiber as converters exists anyway). Interconnect is 2 X NAS systems, main desktop, 2-3 servers running Kubernetes (might be on a separate l2 switch as a bit far. None currently have 10 gbps adapters so will need to be purchased. All on copper at this time. Also I have APs and a few other devices that will remain on 1gbps. I already have a m,icrotik router that I can reuse (1gbps, 10 ports).
 I am in a fairly small space so noise is an important factor. Here is what im looking at for now:
 L3:
 New - Microtik CRS309-1G-8S+IN:
 Looks decent, 8 x sfp+ ports. I have experience with Microtik and am used top their OS, however specs are low, especially on L3. It is cheap and should be silent. about 280$USD
 Used - Arista DCS 7X series, 1U. 24X+ SFP+, good manageability, no experience with Arista but thats fine (I have dealt with Juniper and Cisco in the past). Worried about noise... About 400$USD on ebay.
 New - NETGEAR 10-Port Multi-Gigabit/10G Ethernet Smart Managed Pro Switch (MS510TXM) :
 Looks ok but I have heard of issues with Netgear stuff. Mostly copper so less work as installing fiber is more complex, however 2.5 gbps/10gbps copper is more expensive. Also 2x more expensive the others at about 600$USD. Might be worth the cost if silent and ok l3 features.
 I have also looked at Cisco and Jiuniper, but noise levels and cost are really high on those, so im really not sure it makes sense.
 L2:
 Ubiquiti Networks UniFi 8-Port 10G SFP+, looks ok, cost-effective, but out of stock everywhere.
 Anyone has go to models for this? Its a lot more complex then I taught it would be, so many options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on doing a major rebuild of my homelab, hopefully starting it this weekend, and completing by next. I've been going back and forth on whether I should keep a second NAS running for an additional backup location or not.
 The main NAS will be a TrueNAS and main pool will be a 5 disc raid z2 configuration. Raid is not a backup, I know this. I typically keep very important data also saved, less frequently, to an external HDD that spends most of its life unplugged.
 Finally I'm planning to hopefully get an offsite TrueNAS setup in either my office (different state) or mother's home (also different state) that I can remotely backup to.
 I have everything to setup a second unRaid at home. My thought is it's a second backup location, and using unRaid means I can just dump drives as needed into it to grow the pool with little thought to the structure compared to TrueNAS?
 Thoughts from you other homelabbers?

 Are there any self hosted PBX systems available that would provide me with a phone number as well as have ability to push the calls to my cell phone or ability to take calls from my cell phone?

 I can sort of do this with just nginx (without nginx proxy manager) using the conf file which looks similar to this ->
 ​
 upstream picoshare { server picoshare:4001; } server { server_name mydomain.com; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate ./fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key ./privkey.pem; ssl_dhparam ./dhparam.pem; include ./options-ssl-nginx.conf; location /text-matcher { include uwsgi_params; uwsgi_pass text_matcher:8080; } location /picoshare { proxy_pass https://picoshare; } } 
 However I want to use nginx proxy manager to achieve this. I also need to redirect all HTTP calls to HTTPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently learned how to use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose services hosted at my home lab (the recent NetworkChuck Video). I got a new domain, linked a couple of my homelab services (jellyfin, tinytiny rss feed aggregator) to it and it worked great (having 500/500mbps fiber connection).
 2 days later google flagged the main domain and all subdomains as dangerous (Phishing and malware).
 I connected my domain with Google Search Console/Webmaster tools, and it shows that the tinytiny-rss feed aggregator subdomain as the main culprit for the dangerous site.
 I removed the suspected hostname/subdomain from the tunnel 24 hours ago, and still my main site url is still flagged, and even many AV software and firewalls are continuously flagging my domain as malware. I was able yesterday to open my service in Chrome by click continue to the site, but now my AV and firewall refuses the connection.
 I requested google to re-check the domain, but it seems this is not going to work.
 Any tips? Why did even Google flag it? I never published the domain to anybody, it is just for personal use and personal services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm looking for a secure way to host different web browsers through a portal such as Windows Remote Desktop Services or other similar alternatives. I know Remote Desktop Services wouldn't be the best way to achieve this, so I'm hoping there exists a solution specifically made for this purpose.
 I'm looking to set up something similar to Browserling.com but running locally in my network. I want a secure way to open links that may be malicious without fears of infecting my system, or just a way to test different web services with a clean browser each time.
 Are there any self hosted alternatives out there that i can set up on my VMware esxi machine? What setup would be the most secure for this?
 Any leads would be much appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My use case here is a 12 3.5in bay offsite backup. Grunt isn't really required outside of just being able to manage the disks, it's largely about the bays and if i can get unraid running on it. Hotswap is also something i would prefer due to how i store drives during transport. Not looking for anything rack mounted as that's just too much for this purpose.
 So i have two possibilities: 
  
I can try to find a 12 bay case of the small to medium size variety and work around that(maybe with 5.25" hot swap expanders?)
 I can find a consumer NAS that can have it's OS changed(i.e a terramaster, QNAP, etc) and use one of those if i can find one that isn't egregiously expensive, as they tend to have smaller form factors than most DIY cases.
  
Anybody have any ideas on suggestions for either the former or the latter? 12 seems to be a pretty odd non-rack form factor so there's not a whole lot out there i could find. Stuff like the QNAP TS-1655 might work but i couldn't find any to even get a price. The Terramaster T12-423 looked promising but i was wondering if i could find anything cheaper. Old consumer NAS units might be the way to go but i'm not familiar enough with the model numbers of said units to know what to search for. Most case searches yielded not a whole lot.

The serial numbers shown in the photos return no warranty, but they show up as WD products with the following model number: 0F31156 and description: LEE Drive ASM 14.0TB, 512e, SATA P3_PWDIS_Support, Amazon, Secure Erase.
 Would these be safe to buy? What can I do to check they truly are the capacity they claim they are?
 I would like to do a full check with H2testw, but I've been told it takes a while. What would you do?
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: they also show crystal disk info screenshots
 Edit 2: there seem to be 2 sellers, one that is a clearance warehouse, and the other that has a physical retail location and offers a 6 month warranty, so I'll add updates as I go

 I want to upgrade my network due to inconsistent performance (poor reception / unexpected drop outs of non-moving devices), and a desire to roam around my house without the network dropping while working from home. I'd appreciate any thoughts you all have on my plan.
 Constraints
 My brick house is a 2800 sq. ft. split-level with five half-levels that need coverage and a 1/4 acre backyard that needs coverage. Walls are a combination of plaster and drywall.
 Current Setup
 I'm current running a TP-Link Archer C9 router/AP (flashed with DD-WRT) from the top floor on one side of the house and a TP-Link powerline Wi-Fi AP to the third floor on the other side of the house. In general, it works pretty well when near the APs -- within 20 ft sphere of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Currently I'm using an HPE V1920-48G (JG927A) for my homelab and recently I was given a Netgear GS752TPP for free from work. I dug into the spec sheets for both and from what I can find they seem pretty comparable to each other (except for the Netgear having POE). 
 I was wondering if anyone has had experience with one versus the other or knew of any features that one might have over the other. In general though, I'm just curious about people's opinions for whether I should "switch" (no pun intended) out what I have for what I received. As of right now, the only positive I can find for doing so is having POE. 
 Thanks!

 also, i don't have 2 equal hard drives, so i'd get the worse writting and the worse reading speeds from both 
 either way, i wanna sync a folder every night, so that every change i made to a folder on one drive during the day, gets copied over to the other drive during the night at a specified hour
 New files, Edited files, different files with the same file name, deleted files, all completely mirrored from the drive i used during the day, but only perform the changes at night, or maybe every other day even
 ​
 what program could i use to do that?

 It's the setup for my other general purpose domain which doesn't contain my name, don't know how companies considering my job application will like it.
 If this is a bad idea, how about ["contact25@firstlast.com](mailto:"contact1@firstlast.com)"? So instead of company name, I'm assigning a unique number to each company.

 I have seen several VoIP apps use self signed certificate thumbprints as a form of verification during key exchange. 
 Two certificates cannot have the same thumbprint. However, can a certificate be engineered/coded to have the same thumbprint as the original certificate? 
 If this is not, how is it not possible? 
 Additionally, what is a digital signature? 
 Thank you.

 Better ones like 123, 101, 24, 365 etc were taken so these two are the best I can come up with. Also available are 000, 222, 444, 555, 888.
 If I were to give my email to you, which one do you think looks better and is easier for you to rememer? Like it sticks and less likely to be confused with something else etc. Just like I'm not going for 3650 because people might forget the 0 at the end.

I have wanted to move away from JumpCloud and properly set up Active Directory on Windows Server 2022. I already moved all my VM's to a second hard drive (and physically unplugged it), so nothing important is on my C drive. I also made a windows server USB flash drive with Rufus, but I am not sure what the best way to install it is. My server is in my basement and does not have a monitor, keyboard, or mouse plugged into it. I have always used MeshCentral/Team Viewer to access it. 
 Is there a way to remotely install Windows Server, such as through TeamViewer? Obviously, TeamViewer wouldn't work because the os is being installed, but there has to be an easier way than to sit there with a monitor and keyboard. Does anyone know of any software that would allow me to remotely install an OS, or even a way to install TeamViewer/MeshCentral after install automatically? I use NTLite to install Windows 10 with PowerShell scripts to install everything, but would that work for Windows Server?
 Edit: To clarify, NTLite does work for Windows Server, but even that still requires me to click on the screen to start the install. It’s a lot less clicks, but still requires interaction with a monitor/keyboard.

 I want to know what CPU would you recommend. I read the max core count for dual cpu is 16 core but I have seen that some second hand shops sell this with a configuration of 2x E5-2680v2 (10 core per CPU). Did i misread or the 2013 boot block motherboard supports more than 16 core total?
 Also I was thinking of upgrading to 2x E5-2667v2. What are your thoughts? Thanks

I can't right click anything in the video player area, opening up developer tools causes the video to disappear without a trace in the "Elements" section, disabling JavaScript does nothing to stop the removal of said video once Developer Tools opens. JDownloader picks up nothing because the webpage its on has no video technically, only after the user's manual input does the Netu.tv media appear. Extensions on Google Chrome like CocoNut don't pick it up, even with "force download". Certainly someone amongst the data hoarding hivemind can find a way to fetch these videos? Preferably in their raw form and not just via screen-recording?

House is wired for UTP CAT5, and patch cables where used are UTP CAT6. CAT6 is used for two POE Unifi AP’s. The rack is wall mounted and the rack mount power strip is plugged into a UPS that sits on the floor, but will soon be wall mounted with a R720 server - very close to rack in question. There is a Unfii Dream Machine SE and QNAP NAS in the rack, both have three prong plugs. The POE ports on the DMSE will plug into patch panel and then continue on there way. 
 Do I need to ground the rack? Should I ground the rack? If I do, can I attach ground cable to the rack and bolts where DMSE connects to the rack where there is bare metal? I don’t see a grounding point on the rack - although might have missed it. If my situation doesn’t require grounding, is there a possible home lab/networking upgrade path where I would need to ground? Thanks in advance for any advice.

I’m still deciding between the two but I’m having trouble understanding how people download the movies and shows. Do people buy the movies/shows from somewhere? Do they pirate it? Where do people download their media from? I’ve seen YouTube videos where someone said some people turn their CDs to digital versions (onto Plex, Jellyfish, etc). But I’m not interested in owning the physical and digital copy. I do have services like Disney+, Hulu, etc. Do people somehow download the movies on there onto Plex/Jellyfish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been wiring rooms in my house with some Cat 6 ethernet cables (20-30m) as I wanted some future proofing for 2.5Gbe, 5Gbe and potentially 10Gbe. Currently 10Gbase-T seems very demanding on amount of power draw and the cooling required for anything more than just a single port. I know there are fiber options but bending OM3 cables around corners fills me with dread.
 Just wanted to know is the power draw due to the amount of processing required to send and read data? Will power/heat come down in the future as we get more efficient/faster chips to the point where we can get affordable consumer grade switches/routers. Was transitioning from 100 mbe to 1 Gbe similar in that the power/heat was significant but came down over time?

 This one is annoying me! - There's a historic Youtube video that has been made unavailable for copyright - There are a few other copies on YouTube, but as I recall this was the only one that is in any decent definition.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8dafLxLcI
 On Wayback machine, it goes back to 2008, but those older versions all seem to want Flash and I can't work out how on earth to download them anyway. It's nice of Archive.org to have it archived, but if you can't use it, that's annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a family death I’ve ended up with about 400gb of data pulled from around a dozen mixed drives. I’ve transferred it onto my NAS and stored it in folders by source. (It was easier to harvest it into one location for my wife to pull some family photos from). The storage was chaotic!!! There were recent (i.e newish) drives that had some old stuff, but not all the old stuff, as well as some stuff that appears to be the only copy. Some drives even contained the same data multiple times buried in folders inside folders. 🤯
 I’m running synology DS920+. What’s the easiest way to pull data out by type and remove duplicates? E.g. pull all the photos out into a single folder. I don’t want to lose anything but I don’t need 40 copies of a school nativity from 20 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the title says it all. I am looking at the WD MyCloud 2bay Expert EX2 NAS. I currently have 2 separate 2tb externals hooked up to my Linux server and my wife directly backs her phones photos to it via the wifi network connection. Plus we stream some media and use it for backup files, etc. I currently run rsync to copy one HD to the other every few months for redundancy. One main feature I want in a NAS is the raid option so I don't have to continue to manually back up the redundancy.
 Is this a good device for me to upgrade to?
 Here is the link for Best Buy. Also, I'd love other suggestion but I need to stay at the $160ish price point.

They were easy fixes but I wanna check for more inconsistencies including file moves. However I don't wanna be checking through so many files one by one.
 I know windows explorer can list all files of a type, showing modification dates for each, but that doesn't include folders and there could be some file types I'm forgetting. Is there a software that would list everything for each hard drive, with the modification dates so I can go through and compare lists for both?
 Bonus points if they can list everything with a number, to make things even easier.

 last time I shucked an external drive years ago, they were pretty much WD Red drives. 
 I am planning to have one again as an internal drive.
 How is the situation now? Is it recommended? Does it have any downsides? Are they still red ones? Do I have to tape that one pin for both versions (Elements/My Book)?
 Do you suggest to buy other brands? I was pretty happy about WD Red ones but maybe there are better ones considering price-performance?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, as I have a bit of free time during the holidays, I'm beginning to think about building out some network infrastructure in my garage which mostly serves as a wood working workshop, but which also includes a workbench that I use for some minor experimentation with ham radio and electronics. I currently have two POE cables running into the room to power a pair of POE cameras that I use to monitor a feral cat that I feed inside, but I don't have any other cabling currently: it's a blank slate.
 Basic needs are perhaps six or so ports that are routed to my electronics bench, another four or so which are POE ports that I can use to power my existing cameras, plus an extension, and maybe an inexpensive 2.4G access point to provide more reliable access to some Tasmota sensors. I currently am using a https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GS211V9 hooked to my pfsense router, which may get repurposed out to the garage. 1GB networking is probably fine here, I'll probably create a subnet using one of the spare ports on my KingNovy pfsense box, which technically opens up the possibility of 2.5GB networking, but no device I'm likely to have in the garage 
 Has anyone else done something like this? I am interested in seeing other similar small network setups. The environment is likely to be fairly dusty (working on better dust collection in the shop, but again, that's another project). I'm probably going to build a small case to house the major bits, with just a small switch mounted to the workbench, with some little silicone dust caps to keep the worst of the dust out when not in use? 
 I recognize this isn't a very fancy project, but I'm interested in doing a better job than just laying cables around everywhere willy nilly.
 Thank you all for your advice!

 I am looking for a self-hosted low-cost or free solution to potentially replace Pulseway for me. I would like to find something that is along the lines of Pulseway I have tested tacticalrmm but the Linux agents are not free. I have also tried MeshCentral & Rport but they do not offer app installation or system monitoring. 
 Here are things that I would like to do :
 Windows & Linux agents .. mac optional not really needed. 
 Remote desktop access
 Remote file storage access
 Software management
 System recourse logging ( CPU, memory, storage, network )
 Powershell, CMD, Linux terminal to run scripts
 Patch management
 Notifications for events - high CPU / ram usage / offline device. 
 I do not mind running 2 solutions so long as they can be run and remote systems can communicate without the need for VPN.

 I am new to this community and the concept of self hosting. I’m trying to decide if it is better to hire a local company to setup or if this is something I can or should learn to handle myself. 
 I would rate my own skills between low and medium. i’ve built a couple gaming computers, i like to run mods on most games. i have a vpn on my phone, but honestly couldn’t tell you the technical side of what it does. i know i should have it on my router but i don’t. pretty basic stuff. I know very little about network architecture if that’s even the right term. Im reading through a couple DIY guides that seem to makes sense conceptually, but i am rapidly becoming overwhelmed with the technical jargon.
 The end goal is an outdoor surveillance that i can view from my phone and will give me notifications when movement is detected. i’ve been using nest but have not been impressed. Essentially that’s all the functionality i need, but might want some room to grow into automation.
 So my question is, is this worth it to push through this barrier to entry and learn or is this something best left to trusted professional? 
 what does something like this even cost in terms of hardware?
 are there any recommendations for a place to start? videos? Hell, i’ll even take book recommendations. 
 thanks for reading

 Currently, I am running Proxmox and have 4 VM + 4 LXC running on it. I have the following services: https://imgur.com/a/POaQFhG
 I want to have redundancy on my drives. I initially planned on installing OMV and using RAID5 config. for the drives. The machine will be used for media storage only. I have another machine for NAS stuff. I plan to backup all the media to Backblaze B2.
 I recently was in talks with a developer for Bazarr app, he suggested that I go with unRAID. So, I got a trail for unRAID. It's nice and simple. Few click here, few click there and you are done.
 I managed to mock migrate all my current services to unRAID docker containers just fine. Played around with caching too.
 After using it for about a week, I am still questioning whether it is a necessary purchase for me.
 My main questions are:
  
How different is unRAID's parity disk approach from RAID5?
 How reliable is OMV?
 Most importantly, do I need unRAID?

I feel like I have a decent grasp on Linux, I can vaguely understand how the internet works, I can follow installation guides for self-hosted stuff and look things up when I get stuck. But I still feel like a beginner, y'know? I don't know enough to start leaving holes in my firewall with 100% confidence that I won't get DDOSed or hacked or doxxed, so I don't. Everything I've made so far has either stayed in my private network or only been left open for a few hours at most. 
 Ideally I'd like to run a simple blog website, a VPN, maybe a Minecraft server, and maaaaybe a private Mastodon instance if I can handle it. I know all of this would have to be publicly exposed, so how do I go about publicly exposing servers safely? If this is still too advanced for the level I'm at (which I imagine it is), what's the best learning path for me to get there? Books, websites, tutorials, etc?
 Thanks for your help!

 Main Post
 I am a huge fan of using rclone with --backup-dir (docs) for backups.
 It is not the most efficient, most featureful, advanced, sexy, fastest, etc. of the different backup solutions. But it makes up for all of this in a key area: simplicity. 
 When it comes to backups, there is a lot to be said for being simple and easy. Easy to understand, easy to restore, easy to verify.
 However, there is a major problem with rclone backups: it needs to list the destination every time which can be very slow. (There are others too but this is the main one).
 So I created rirb: reverse incremental rclone…]]></summary>

 I'm a total newbee when it comes to DMS and I am looking for a little open source DMS that I can host in my home network with proxmox.
 The idea is to use the new scanner I just got that allows my to scan to 5 different network folders that I can predefine.
 What I want
  
pdfs should automatically be saved/converted to OCRed pdfs
 pdfs should be renamed yyyy_mm_dd (file created date)_FoldernameSomeNumber
 Client-Server DMS that let's me search for text fragments, ideally automatically reads the date from letters and puts in in a field, maybe the same for the title and idealy I can pre-configure some attributed that reoccruing letters have in order to apply certain tags, maybe even rename the documents etc.
  
Is that doable? Is it a reasonable approach?

I want to get evertyhing copied over from the existing one and I have dual 10gig NICs in each of them so I'd like to use that lane for the initial copy and subsequent scheduled backup.
 I have the 10gig interfaces configured like so for each server (only posting the image of one)
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/hfpn8913b87a1.png?width=2358&format=png&auto=webp&s=a148539f3913b3b9c8480d1c5971d30690d9fece
 When I run iperf3 from one of them as the 'server' and the other as the 'client' I can't get more than 980 mbps for transfers. One thing to note: when I run the client command I use the IP of the other server, but it's not the IP of either of the above interfaces. If I try to call it with one of the 10gig IPs from the image above it just hangs there.
 So i feel like the issue with my test is that iperf3 isn't actually using the NICs for the transfer. Am I doing something wrong in iperf or in the setup, or both?

I just bought a 42u server rack, and I just upgraded one of my Dell Powervault DR4100 server with 192GB of memory. I also have a cisco catalyst 4948 switch as well. I was thinking of buying a Forigate Fortinet firewall, I have seen other people recommend untangle firewall as well. I have heard mixed reviews on both. I was wondering, If I am correct in saying, that if the license is expired, I cannot use most of the features. Including the web filtering feature. Is there any firewall I can buy off of ebay to either test or possibly implement down the road with that doesn't require a license to use these features?
 Thank you.

 (planing to run 3 in raidz1 for vms + logging and another 2 for caching)
 Since it should last as long as possible and the server is going to be used for extensive writing (logging as well as cache for some jbods/hdd pools) i am looking for at least 1pbw better 4+pbw lifespan.
 I already looked through used enterprise ssds on ebay for a couple hours but didnt decide yet.
 One that caught my attention is the Toshiba THNSN81Q92CSE (1.92tb for 120$) but i couldnt find any documentation regarding lifespan.
 Would it be a good choice?
 I also looked through many intel ones but got a bit confused regarding their naming (and vastly different endurance ratings according to the wikipedia article)
 What can you recommend?

 Machine Ryzen 5700x, msi b550m pro-vdh wifi, 16gb ram.
 pci sata card: https://www.startech.com/en-ca/cards-adapters/pexesat322i
 Drive 1x 500gb SSD, 3x3TB HDD, 1x1TB HDD
 Looking to run Proxmox, and virtualize unRaid purely as a NAS, and using proxmox as I need to virtualize a couple other environments.
 I did one pass and got everything up and running with proxmox install in xfs, however I want to encrypt all of the drives.
 Following the guide here I can encrypt the Proxmox install:
 https://herold.space/proxmox-zfs-full-disk-encryption-with-ssh-remote-unlock/
 ​
 However, I need a sanity check on what I need to do to make this work effectively:
  
Get another SSD, and install it zfs in raid1 on JUST the SSDs and encrypt the zfs
 Get a larger pci raid card and pass through the pci card with all drives to unRaid have unraid encrypt xfs / zfs and manage
 Get a 3rd SSD for a cache drive connected to the raid card, or can I virtualize this from extra space on the zfs drives
 Backup all my files from my VM's on unRaid
  
Option 2: Set all drives to ZFS (pool 0 - SSD) (pool1 - HDD) by proxmox and nas some other way.
 Option 3: Option 2 + Pass virtualized drives to unRaid? I think I lose access to smart data etc if I do it this way.
 My goal is just encrypted fault resistant storage of my VM's and Data.

I don’t even know where to begin.

 Any tips?

 Can I put more HDD’s in? Maybe some 2.5?
 If I set it up as a NAS now then decide later I want bugger HDDs can I just add them to the system or do I need to start a new instance of the NAS some how? 
 Lastly, TrueNAS scale or core ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, let me paint you a picture. :) So, I have an OpenMediaVault 6 server in the house, with some services like radarr, sonarr and so on, all in docker, with swag+duckdns for the reverse proxy setup, and that worked great, until a few days ago. In a thunderstorm, my modem and router died. I have my own modem, I don't use my ISP's modem. But now I have to, until I buy something new. So, now, with this modem I can't access my services outside the house. Not even from the house, I get this error when I test it from my PC:
 The connection has timed out
 The ports are forwarded. The weird thing is, my friend has the same setup, exept he has his own router, but he uses the same ISP modem, we are on the same ISP. I set up his OMV, everything, opened ports, all of it. And it works fine with him.
 I thought maybe the issue is because I'm using only the modem, without a router, because that's the only difference, but I had the same issue whenever I tried to swap modems, while I still had the router, during some testings and stuff.
 I've just checked the settings in his modem via AnyDesk, and they are literally the same. I can access his services from my house without issues.
 The modem is ZTE ZXHN H168N V3.1 .
 I don't know what else to post here, if you ask me I can post some screenshots or settings.
 Any ideas guys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to the home lab environment and I am wondering whether I should get a managed or unmanaged switch. I have done some research before posting here but i am still unsure.
 I have read many articles saying that managed switched are useful for homes that have a lot of IoT devices, which I have a ton of (smart lighting, smart sockets and digital assistants in almost every room of my house). I don't know if the ability to create VLANs will be necessary for me as it will only be used for my main machine and 2 servers, one that will be running a webserver and a game server, each in its own docker container and then the other as a NAS.
 Based on this would it be worth getting a managed switch anyway, and spending the time learning the necessary network management skills, or just getting an unmanaged switch for the simplicity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 My homelab grows little by little, and I want to have access to it outside of my LAN, via VPN. Now, I could install Wireguard on my server, but I mess a lot with it, and it has big chance of being broken. More over, since it's a simple ThinkCentre that does not support wake-on-wan, theoretically I could lose connection in case of power outage while I'm away.
 So I'm looking for a dedicated device that will run only VPN, and maybe DNS (AdGuard Home). I could get a Pi for that, but I kind of don't understand their point. They are not cheap, and they run on SD cards which a prone to corruption (eventually).
 Another option is to run the VPN on my router, but Omada currently supports only OpenVPN and not Wireguard, and I have no idea when, or if, they will support it.
 I found this one GL.iNet - GL-MT2500 / Brume 2 which is in pre order and pretty affordable. It runs Wireguard and AdGuard home, and acts as both VPN server and client. I've heard about GL.iNet before, but I still worry about their reputation (although it seems they run mainly on open source software).
 Appreciate if someone can shed some light on that particular device or suggest something else.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey gang, I've spent a solid day of interspersed researching on these cards and found a lot of guidance that says these things usually have an LSI logo, but not neccesarily that its fake if it doesn't. I bought https://www.ebay.com/itm/155042469639 this card recently and it hasn't arrived yet, but I'd love to understand if there are any signs this is either legitimate or fake from the stock images.
 Particulary, it looks like it has the words "FastPCB" where I'd expect a logo to go. However, the seller has extensive and positive feedback (5 digits of positive). 
 The card itself looks to be an Inspur with a model #YZCA-00019-101 found on the back of the image. 
 I tried googling for this metadata and found nothing really to say yes or no for counterfeit signs or if the logo should be missing.
 Basically I'm struggling to reach a good stopping point here and would love this squad's advice on any and all analysis of this offering's legitimacy. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

 300+ full-color SVG icons of homelab-related software, products, and brands for use in dashboards, network diagrams, etc...
 https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets
 See a preview of all icons here
  
In my dashboards and network diagrams, I was using the already existing SVG icon sets (Simple Icons, Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, etc...), as well as random PNG/JPG files I found online. However, I always wanted consistently-sized full-color SVGs (instead of black/monotone or random PNG/JPG files).
 I gathered 300+ SVGs so far, and wanted to share them here.
 https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets.
 I don't intend to replace any existing icon sets. Instead, I'm focused on homelab-related software, products, and brands ONLY.
 I have the following features so far:
  
Consistent viewbox (48x48)
 Optimized with SVGO
 Diagrams.net library (this is the reason I created this project)
 CDN (via jsDelivr)
 PHP (via Packagist)
 Node (via NPM)
 Hugo (via module)
  
Things I'm working on:
  
Adding more icons
 Gathering brand usage guidelines
 Gathering registered trademark (®) or trademark (™) symbols to be added
 Creating more automation for deployments
  
I created this for myself, but figured it might be useful here!

 ​
 Hi All, not sure if this is the best place to post, but thought I'd try.
 ​
 I'm rebuilding some of my VMs and am running into some permissions problems. I am able to write to the share with one VM, but not the other, with the built in user 'radarr'.
 ​
 Both the old (left) and the new (right) VMs have the same SMB share mounted to /mnt/media using cifs. The cifs credentials are the same in each VM and allows me to have full control of the data from TrueNAS under my admin user 'andrew'.
 ​
 You can clearly see in the picture that the permissions of the old VM are set as rwxrwxrwx, while the new is missing write for groups and other. I believe I may have used chmod -R 777 /mnt/media on the old VM, but I honestly can't remember and I'm not sure how to see this (I've since started documenting all changes I make and what they do so this won't happen in the future). I'd also prefer to not 777 an entire dataset, even if it is not sensitive data.
 ​
 I know I can fix this by changing the user running the service, but I want to keep the radarr service running as the user radarr as that is best practice for linux.
 ​
 Any help or pointing to an article I can read would be much appreciated.

 I'm Vihar from Appsmith, and I'm here to share a major update on Appsmith's release (1.8.11).
 Introducing Auto-height for Appsmith widgets—A top requested feature, Auto-height now flexes your Appsmith apps to dynamic changes in content, conditional visibility, and end-user screens.
 With this update,
 1️⃣ Text widgets now fold around the content inside. Smooth!
  
👌 unstructured content from databases like Snowflake, Redshift, and Firebase.
 😍 for social media dashboards, consumer survey analyses, and store reviews.
  
Auto-height for text
 2️⃣ Triggering the 𝚒𝚜𝚅𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚋𝚕𝚎 widget prop conditionally? Let’s take your white-space worries away.
  
for apps with sidebars, as shown in our example ↓.
  
Auto-height for conditionally visible blocks
 3️⃣ Auto-height-enabled widgets also change their size to change screen sizes.
  
for stock inventory updates, on-site checks, and forms for field teams.
  
Auto-height for the mobile-layouts
 4️⃣ What you see when building apps is what you get when viewing it, say, with Containers and the Canvas.
 Auto-height for the canvas
 What's next?
  
𝚖𝚒𝚗-𝚖𝚊𝚡 heights in widget props

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using a managed instance of Nextcloud for some time and it's worked quite well for me so far. But since I switched to Obsidian for notetaking, the lack of two-way sync in the Android client is a huge annoyance. 
 The corresponding issue on Github has been open since 2016 and even though there are a few hundred dollars bounty exposed, nothing is moving there.
 I don't even want to talk about the fact that two-way sync is the most basic feature of a cloud service.
 What can I do about it?
  
Using a third-party app like folder sync contradicts the whole privacy idea of having your own Nextcloud instance
 Switching to OneDrive together with an encryption app isn't really an option since I'd like to be able to access my files for example on my work machine where I can't install any encryption apps.
 Is there an alternative to Nextcloud which is able to do two way sync on Android and Windows?
 Any other ideas...?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/homelab,
 I've been deep in research for weeks now looking into all the possible ways to go for a home network rebuild. For a long time I was putting a high value on unified management / SDN solutions like Unifi or TP-Link Omada, but I am beginning to rethink that. It seems like both platforms have the kinds of drawbacks (support, hardware quality and availability, feature roadmaps that never materialize) that I would find endlessly frustrating as someone with a day job in IT.
 I know the sub is geared more toward learning and experimentation, and I value that too, but I have to balance that with reliability and availability of the network, particularly as I work remotely. Central management seemed very appealing for a no-nonsense setup, but now I am less sure that I will see long-term value from buying into such a stack.
 So I'm looking for input on this -- is the single pane management of something like Unifi or Omada worth the other headaches from these companies? Or would I be better served going with older "best of breed" enterprise equipment for switching and wireless, paired with something like pfSense for routing? I lose the central management, but it seems clear that I would have better hardware for similar expense.
 If you lean enterprise in your response, please mention what hardware you prefer for APs, switching, and routing. I would especially like to hear your opinions on mixed environments. ATM I am considering Ruckus AP / Aruba ION switching (local control) / pfSense as a potential build if dissuaded from Unifi or Omada, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/Homelab,
 I've recently come into 8x6TB WD Red drives and I plan to configure these all in RAID6. I've already got an LSI-9211 RAID card for the setup.
 My problem is that my case, which I otherwise love, doesn't have enough storage for 8 3.5" drives. Here's a link to the specs of the case that I have and it only has 4 internal 3.5" bays. I'm okay with removing any or all of the 2.5" bays or the 5.25" bays if needed, but I haven't found a suitable storage method for what I would put in place for those drives.
 Has anyone had experience or luck expanding storage in their homelab? Are there any other concerns I should be aware of? I know heat may be an issue, but there are two 80mm fans directly in front of the drive bays, and the processor is watercooled by a Swiftech H220 so the internals of the computer don't get too hot as it's configured now.

 I'm in the market for 4x 2tb NVMe Gen4. Going to put them in a PCIe NVMe bay eventually. Do these specs check out? Only think I'm worried about is how drives tend to slow down over time.Not sure how important VNAND is compared to TLD, QLC, cache etc., in regards to speed and longevity.This price and speed seem too good to be true. All these drives are just for storage, OS will be on a Samsung Pro.
 Also, these drives will solely be used for music production and reading, not writing; loading many heavy files/samples simultaneously, if that helps.

I kind of miss having users. What could I self host and actually have some users? I've got servers collecting dust and gigabit up/down, but I've just got no actual motivating ideas. Does anyone still know what a bbs is/was? What is the modern day equivalent? Infotainment, messagey, with games. Can run on window, linux, most databases, anything. Mastodon was fun for like a day. Fun enough to pay 11 bucks for a domain to test it, but nah, too specific. Something that can still be fun without a ton of users, couple hundred might be nice.

 I've come into an offer for a r210 II and I've read good things about it, but i was wondering if it is old info and if there are currently better options.
 I have several vlans and unfortunately my switch showed as a fake L3 one, so i need inter-vlan routing at router level. But i also seek for low power consumption, as my homelab runs on sun power. 😎
 I bought two NUCs, but they simply didn't seem good to use them for pfsense. I repurposed them as Iot machines.
 Thanks guys for your suggestions 🙂
 Edit: Ah, and I'm running it on a stick, i would put a 10gbe card on it.

 I am looking for a self hosted content management website where we can control mentioned content above, I have some requirements.
  
No SSO behind a stupid paywall (LDAP can work too)
 A good REST API
 Ability to customize the software so I can hook it up with a custom library I made in Node that connects to our cloud service and creates folders for those songs/avatars/playlists (basically a way to hook it up when a content gets CMUD)
  
I have tried Strapi, it was an OK solution but not having an SSO and not being able to customize the routes to add my library was a minus.
 I tried PayloadCMS for a while and the team used it but I had to implement my own SSO which would get erased by each update to come. I like how it had a good REST API and how customizable it was but it looked very unfinished and the GUI was really empty.
 Ability to use the software in Docker compose would be a plus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to NAS stuff and have an ASUSTOR AS1102T 2 bay NAS. Been using it quite smoothly for the past month. Then I attempted an experiment. After making sure all data is backed up, I powered off the NAS, took out the hard drive, and plugged it into a windows computer. I wanted to see if it’s possible to see the files directly on a desktop (because I intend to use hard drives as Cold Storage as I don’t have much to spend on NAS with many bays). To no avail, windows didn’t recognise it. Also ran a quick health check and all sectors green. I plugged it back into the NAS (another SATA port) and booted up the NAS, but it showed disk errors. I powered off the NAS, and switched the hdd to the original port, and booted it up again, but was met with disk errors again. 
 So my questions are: 1) are NAS hdd supposed to be allowed to be plugged out? 2) when they are plugged back in, does port matter? 3) will windows “corrupt/override” the file system that the NAS has written?
 I believe the answer to at least one of these is the reason for the results of my experiment. It would be disappointing if (1) turned out to be “no”, as that was my intended usage. What do you guys think? :)
 Perhaps I need to click on “repair” as mentioned here? https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/ijbac9/disk_drive_order/g3chu61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I’m fairly new to data hoarding and it’s not something I’ve been able to do much due to Wi-Fi bandwidth caps, but now I’m on a plan with much higher bandwidth with a pretty eh download speed (which is capped to max 50mbps)
 I have a 1 TB ssd, a 1 TB HDD in my laptop (no pc atm), and a 5 TB external HDD. I bought a 2012 Dell OptiPlex 790 earlier this year and have regretted buying it ever since. I can’t sell it since no one would pay for what it cost me. $50 for the machine itself and little over $100 to get it shipped to me, I don’t live in the western world and the OptiPlex came from the US.
 The OptiPlex has a single hard drive bay and seeing as it is from a decade ago, I doubt m.2 ssd is an option. Came with a 4 GB stick and a user here or over in the NAS subreddit recommended that I get either 8 or 16 GB which I’m planning on doing.
 But the main issue at hand is using hard drives. Now, the option that I’ve been considering for a while is using external hard drive dock. Would any of you recommend me going this route or should I count my losses and look for another option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some backstory before the question:
 I've had some suspicious activity in my neighborhood lately. I have some outdoor facing PoE cameras on my network that are currently accessible to the internet so we can view them when not home (using BlueIris). I've been doing some more networking at work and want to really isolate everything correctly on my home network. Separating the cameras and BlueIris VM onto their own vlan, setting up routes to only allow certain IPs to connect, things like that. I think it would be good exercise to learn more on networking along with properly securing my network.
 The end goal is to view the RTSP streams of the cameras on a single monitor without having to RDP into my blue iris VM. Being able to do that without having to do anything except start the device would be great too, but thats more of a wish because I don't know if it is possible yet.
 I've been looking at Thin-Clients like a Dell Wyse 3040 or an HP T620 to view camera streams either through VLC or to just load a webpage that is hosting the RTSP streams on. I see a lot of raspberry pi suggestions online for my use-case, but the shortage and prices make it completely out of the question. I want to have this device on the same vlan as the cameras/BlueIris VM/Webserver hosting the streams, only connected to a monitor so my non-tech-savy other half doesn't have to do anything but turn the monitor on. 
 The question:
 Has anyone used thin-clients to achieve something similar? I don't think viewing the streams is that resource intensive, but I don't have any experience with thin-clients. Are they are powerful enough to view all the streams at the same time, whether on VLC locally, or viewing them on a webpage? I figured I would take a shot in the dark and ask before spending anything on this idea.
 Thank you for reading and considering my rambling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short, cygwin is a great niche project but it doesn't keep all the versions online and thus Win systems that go EOL get unsupported.
 That is a shame as one may still want to use old system for vintage projects, fortunately there is one project, the cygwin time machine, that tries to save all the notable releases.
 http://www.crouchingtigerhiddenfruitbat.org/Cygwin/timemachine.html
 The question is, that site may go down (because internet forgets, not immediately, but it does), are there p2p resources to keep mirrors of it alive?
  
Edit: a bit surprised by the downvotes. I though the sub was for trying to save things, also (especially?) niche things that are legal to share, rather than mostly "download a lot of Linux ISOs that at the end are pirated films". I guess that it mostly dedicated to mainstream data and I expected a bit more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen people ask in the past about the power difference going from v3 to v4 processors, so I wanted to share my experience, your results may vary this is just what happened with my particular TrueNAS Scale server.
 For starters, it's a Dell T-7910 with 128GB of DDR4 ECC memory, 4x6TB WD Red's and 4x800GB Intel DC S3610 SSD's, a Quadro K2200 for the o/s and Quadro P600 video card passed thru to a vm and an Asus quad nvme card with 2 Samsung 1TB 970 evo's. Currently running TrueNAS Scale 22.02.4 with a few apps and a few vm's running game servers and plex, this is not idle power as my system is never truly idle.
 When it had dual E5-2630l v3 processors it averaged 23% cpu utilization as reported by TrueNAS and was pulling on average 165 watts as reported by a kill-a-watt
 With the dual E5-2620 v4 processors installed with the same apps and vm's running, TrueNAS reports 12% utilization and kill-a-watt is reporting 148 watts on average. 
 I thought this would be a decent comparison since both of these models are 8 core 16 thread cpu's, however there is a small difference in clock speeds. 1.8 on the L version v3 and 2.1 on the v4. the L version also has a tdp of 55 watts where the v4 has a TDP of 85 watts. The v3 is a Haswell and the v4 is a Broadwell. 
 These were averages over a 24 hour period of normal use, so all in all it saved only 17w doing the upgrade to the newer processors under my particular use case. These are approximations and not scientific by any means but just wanted to share my results.

Was about to upgrade one nas to 20tb using a wd sale assuming similar experience …however heard some chatter about some noise issues. Either the design of the drive itself isnt the same experience, or i heard theres some new feature around lubrication causing some noise?
 Anyway, anyone with low noise requirements upgrade any of their nas units to 20tb and been happy? If not why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok... so I need some help here.
 I'm planning on upgrading my UNRAID setup.
 Currently I have 24TB total, 10TB free.
 I've got two newer 8TB drives as parity (one shucked, one WD Gold). The rest of the drives are junky sas/sata used drives from ebay 3TB each.
 These drives are all in a Supermicro CSE-846 case, Supermicro X9DR3-F mobo with Dual Xeon E5-2620's 2.00GHz
 I am moving to a single e5-2680v3, probably going to spring for a Fractal Define R5 (unless you have other recommendations?)
 ANYWAYS,
 So I'd like to basically rebuild the whole NAS while I'm at this. What does that mean? Well...
 I'm unhappy with the 3TB drives. They are too noisy and suck up too much power for what they are. I'd like to replace them with a couple 8 TB drives, or maybe even redo my parity setup?
 I really like having dual parity. I know it would be cheaper to just go to single parity but I feel like dual is worth it?
 I guess what I'm wondering is if I should upgrade my parity drives to 12-14TB, and then just buy at least one more 8 TB drive
 OR
 Just get 3 8TB drives and go from there.
 I REALLY won't need all the storage I currently have right away as I plan on reorganizing and starting my linux ISO collection from scratch, so I can slowly acquire drives as needed (outside of parity of course)
 ​
 Recommendations on strategy, specific drives, and cases would be super awesome!
 ​
 Thanks!

 This is kindof a mixed post asking for some specific answers to get me on my way for this particular project, but also looking for resources to study up for the future. No pressure to run the gauntlet on all these questions, I am just grateful for any help you may offer.
 My lingering questions include:
  
Is it worth it to break a large archive into parts, or is it best to leave it as one archive? If its better to break it into parts, what is the best practice volume size all things considered? (I will have this archive backed up on mac, windows and linux machines, online, and will be distributed to a handful of people).
 
Is there a in depth user level best practices resource on file compression? Something that outlines use cases i.e. best method for speed com…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys.
 I am trying to set up a self hosted server on my rasp. My Nginx server is running on docker and listening on port 80 and [::]:80 with a simple index. I bought a domain name too in which I used an AAAA record type to use the IPv6 address of the raspberry itself as my provider is using cgnat and I don't have a unique public ip for port forwarding etc. I can access the domain from all devices in my local network without a problem, my index page is showing up fine. However when I try to access it from the public, for example using my network data or from another network, chrome either doesn't load (from mobile data) or throws DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN (at least to the network my friend tried).
 I have enabled ufw in my server with opening port 80 to the public as well as allowing forwarding to docker and adding the rules found in https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker. Dns seems to be completely propagated. Even if I disable ufw, the situation remains the same and no log is showing up when I access it from outside when the firewall is enabled.
 My nginx conf:
 server {
 listen 80;
 listen [::]:80;
 server_name example.com www.example.com;
 root /usr/share/nginx/html/;
 index index.html; }
 and firewall rules related to port 80:
 80 on eth0 ALLOW Anywhere
 80 (v6) on eth0 ALLOW Anywhere (v6)
 80/tcp ALLOW FWD 192.168.1.0/24
 80/tcp ALLOW FWD Anywhere
 80/tcp (v6) ALLOW FWD Anywhere (v6)
 Even when I try to get a certificate from LetsEncrypt I get The Certificate Authority failed to download the temporary challenge files created by Certbot.
 Do you have any idea what misconfiguration could be on my side or what the problem could be?

 Apologies if this is the wrong place or way to ask for this help, but I need help from here for my college project, please take 3-5 mins from your time if you can :)
 I'm writing a research paper about a Fixed Cost Cloud service model where initially the user will be allotted 1Gbps as is the norm, and after 1TB (or whatever the plan might be), the user will be throttled to 50Mbps, but they won't be billed for the Transfer.
 I'm empathizing with needs of a self hosted community, a small business or a student professional whose bandwidth needs might not be a lot and the traffic is in small chunks, but they're paying the cloud providers for their Bandwidth Over usage.
 I need your advice for this project. I know it cannot work for everyone, Hence I need your response and suggestions for this.
 We (me and my batchmate) have also launched a Google Form and we'll be glad if you could take the small time to fill that.
 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBLf8M4uIy4SwSbFZkCKfEhjp49-BPeCX6IlFikfhGUqAu0g/viewform
 Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you :))

 I'm a student at a university that's located a bit far from the city, and the WiFi and mobile data connections here are really spotty. On a good day, we might get 10-15 Mbps at best, and it's really inconsistent, especially in the dorms. The university library does have a wired fiber connection that gives us 200 Mbps+ on average, but the issue is that they have a Sophos Proxy/Firewall setup that blocks a lot of entertainment websites like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+. YouTube is still accessible, though.
 I have a problem where I need to update Microsoft Flight Simulator (40 GB worth of updates!) and work with my personal NextCloud Drive, which would sync a lot faster with the faster internet connection at the library. I use Tailscale and an Nginx Proxy Manager to manag…]]></summary>

 I simply don't have the self-discipline to use the peicemeal approach for long before giving up and just throwing things on my drives.
 So I know I need a program that at the very least holds my hand as I archive data, I was wondering if such a useful software might exist?

 Ideally, I would write all the backed up files to a text file, then tell 'rsync' to exclude all the files and directories in that file. Certainly I'm not the first one, so curious how others have done this? TIA

The plug that comes with the server is 3 prong type B.
 Do I need to get an electrician to change anything? The breaker for that outlet on my breaker box says 120/240v. Will it already provide 240v power to this outlet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask in, but I give it a go.
 I’m soonly deploying a truenas scale server with a couple of petabytes with data. On this server, unrelated to the data, I want to host a centralized email client. Primarily client. It maybe sounds weird, but it makes sense for my situation. To make a long story short, in bullet points what I am searching for:
 — Self hosted centralized email client
 - Readily available apps on different platforms (android, ios, ipados and preferable ubuntu/windows/etc)
 - The client has to have compatibility with exchange, google mail, smtp/imap/pop3 mailservers located elsewhere and the client also needs a server attached to serve some domain names with a mail server itself.
 ​
 The idea, in more practical terms, is to have really all the email en adresses in one place that can be accessed from anywhere. For example: if I grab a new device somewhere (shared pc, new phone on the airport, a borrowed ipad on a site somewhere, etc); I just want to be able to grab the accompanying app or use the web interface and have access to all my mails and mail adresses (from and for very different sources).
 ​
 I have looked at quite a few solutions, but nothing I found until now did have everything I need. For now I just manage many different adresses and some are loaded in some devices, some aren’t; some I just only use the web gui for the specific purpose it has. I just want to centralize everything and be able to use whatever device I can grab wherever I am to get the work done that needs to be done.
 ​
 Sorry for the long post and let me know if I overlooked some service or result or if I missed something in the rules of this sub reddit.
 ​
 Ps. Things like 2 auth and sorting/categorizing/GTD and so forth are also nice to have, and probably important. But these things pale in comparison to the functionality I‘m looking for described as above

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Not sure if you know about what's been happening with Trakt these last couple of days. They had some sort of database crash and it's taking several days to recover (and it seems that data's been lost).
 Now, with the service offline, I noticed how dependent I am of it. So I was thinking about possible similar selfhosted solutions. What I'm looking for is something that:
  
May import my current history from Trakt (in fact not being a VIP user I still don't know if Trakt allow history export).
 Allow Kodi scrobbling (that's important, since I manage all my media library through Kodi and it has a Trakt addon, making it trivial to automatically sync everything I watch).
  
I found this project (MediaTracker) that I installed a couple of days ago and seems very promising, but it apparently has no way to automatically sync from Kodi.
 Do any of you could suggest any alternative?

 My current issue with cyberduck is for some reason, it uses much more CPU compared to other programs. The issue with carotDAV is it only upload files one by one even if you dump in a bunch of files, which I cannot max out my connection.
 To what I understand, rclone doesn't fit my needs. If anyone knows how to setup rclone to work like I how I need it, I would happily use rclone. Filezilla Pro doesn't have a trial so I can't test how well it would work for me.
 ​
 Are there any alternative programs on windows for this use case or how do I properly setup rclone for this use case? I'm ready to learn.
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I hope this type of post is not considered off-topic here. I have read the rules and I think my question is appropriate for this sub-reddit.
 First of all, this is my very first post in this subreddit 😄
 I have a question relating to server racks i.e. server rack cases specifically.
 I'm not in the position to afford expensive server computers that are rack mountable, and even if I could, it would be unreasonable for my use case.
 What I wanna do is "migrate" (I have some servers in a normal desktop tower case) my existing hardware into a setup that is rack-mountable.
 So, I wanna buy a rack cabinet (10" or 19" doesn't really matter to me) and put my "cheap" desktop gear into it.
 I have searched the internet for "server rack cases" and I've found some matches, but they're generally quite tall and bulky.
 There also seem to be cases that are rack-mountable, but they don't have any mount points for, like let's say, a motherboard.
 My existing servers all have an ATX sized motherboard, if possible I'd like to keep them.
 Are there cheap "desktop" (preferably slim) cases that are made to be mounted in a rack cabinet?
 (I know that "desktop" PC and "rack mountable case" are a bit mutually exclusive, why would a normal user want to have their PC in a rack :D)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad passed recently, and he left behind a treasured collection of 5,000+ CD's. I'd like to archive it all as I have many fond memories of listening to them; MP3's are sufficient.
 I was originally thinking of setting up something similar to this, with many drives. Problem is my main machine which has the space and processing power is at my own home; moving either the machine or the CD's between my house and my dad's isn't practical, and the work involved in setting it up starts to sound blocking.
 I also considered just cataloguing them and feeding that into a torrent/Usenet/purchasing script, but many of these are old and do not exist online (and are not sorted), so that doesn't sound any faster.
 How do you suggest I go about this? I'm open to jerry-rigging something together, buying a commercial solution, etc, just not sure what's most efficient. My biggest constraint is I don't get much time at his house, so I want a solution with a high CD throughput. Should I just be ripping images, and then transporting those to my own home for transcoding/tagging/etc?
 Thanks all!
 EDIT: As many of you have mentioned, tagging and metadata is a big problem, especially since many of these CD's have no online presence and can't be auto-tagged. Since the CD's aren't sorted (and I don't want to upset the physical state of things too much), retrieving a disc after ripping isn't feasible. So whatever strategy is used needs to record disc data (e.g. photographs of the case) when it's ripped.

 I really would like to get a small PC/SBC with 2-4 ethernet ports and 2.4GHz WiFi with a decent range to load OPNSense on. Something like the ODroid H3+ is attractive, but it seems like overkill for JUST a router (I'd definitely reach for it if I were building a combo router-NAS), and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions that had a lower price-point and/or more ethernet ports.
 I don't need massive range, mesh network BS, and I'd rather use as much FLOSS as possible.

The server has about 20TB of data on it at the moment
 ​
 I do have a server locally with Proxmox installed, however the high capacity drives are out of my price range at the moment
 ​
 Is there anything I can do to improve throughput? I thought about getting a cloud storage solution and mounting it via SMB or some other protocol to a Linux machine within my Proxmox however I'm unsure what solutions are available to me apart from buying high capacity drives and then cloning the Hetzner box
 ​
 I would ideally like to stream old game ROMS to emulators and such via the solution

It was packed decently well but I guess not well enough. I have to wait until tomorrow to start the return process. 
 Originally I thought it must be a bum external drive dock so tried popping it in my single drive synology to test and it wouldnt show up at all. Glad I didnt jump straight into degrading the pool it is supposed to go into.
 Are there any tips for making sure I get a replacement quickly and efficiently? I am planning on returning the drive to newegg under the replacement option rather than RMA through Seagate.

 There are tons of models for each vendor and except vantec I dont know others. I've seen some vantec products - I have and old pata nexstar, it's still doing the job when needed), but some amazon clients' online reviews seem to say that old quality has gone (and they cost 3x, compared with other firm).
 I had two sabrent but after a couple year, one after another, stop to work.
 Plus: they should work good with linux and ssd disks, some chip may have trim problems (sob). It seems so complicate build an external 2.5 usb disks (I dont trust the ones sale by wd or seagate or toshiba... there are hdd smr disk; I also prefer to not buy a "usb ssd" like Sandisk Extreme, because they are a finished product and I cannot shuck them or change the disk, if needed).
 Some one of you has tested / evaluated these case? Should I evaluate a solution like the FANTEC QB-35US3R. Please note I would not buy a NAS, I have already have enough pc (family says...) and they are too expansive.
 Thanks a lot for reporting you experiences!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I've made a diagram illustrating what I am preparing to set up this week to try and make my thoughts clearer. I'm new to network diagrams so please be forgiving where I've missed obvious conventions & if possible let me know so I can work on this in future.
 My aim:
  
Back up my synology to a remote site (friends house) (as part of 321 backups) onto my Truenas Server
  
On my network side:
  
Run a wireguard docker container on my server
 Using IPTables, add a route to dynamicDNS setup for Friends network ("superprivate".duckdns.com) to go via wireguard docker network. I will be broadly following this guide: https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/routing-docker-host-and-container-traffic-through-wireguard
 All other connectivity will be routed out to the internet without this VPN in place
  
On friends side:
  
Run WG-easy inside Truenas docker app to run as VPN server
 Run duckdns inside Truenas docker app to share dynamic IP
 Run piVPN on raspberry pi as backup VPN server should something go majorly wrong with my Truenas primary VPN server
  
Questions:
  
Please can you comment on my design above and let me know any shortcomings/improvements?
 My biggest unknown in the above is probably the IPTables changes to NAT, to control what connections end up where.
 The Raspberry Pi will run PiVPN as a backup for my truenas container. I'll be several thousand miles away for a few years so want to ensure I can access my truenas just incase things go very wrong. Any issue running two vpns on the same network?
 I've written some bash scripts utilising rsync to push from my synology to the truenas. As my bash scripting is a bit rusty, is it reccomended to use rsync *service* to push directly to my truenas rather than relying on my scripting?
  
Many thanks if you've read through this far :)

 The rack is on wheels and needs to be moved about a bit in a tight space to replace equipment now and then, so some "slack" in the fibre is needed? 
 Do I run the fibre along the floor and up into the rack? That seems to be asking for trouble. 
 Do I try and dangle it from the ceiling into the rack on some hooks?
 Why don't they make fibre in old-school-curly-phone-handset style ;)

 I have loaded with Ubuntu 22.04 server and have been running Plex server and Foundry VTT via docker. Using SFTP / FileZilla for simple file storage. Also working to self host static site with Caddy and Porkbun. Having some learning trials getting things from local to public. 
 I am wanting to reconfig a bit and need some suggestions. Some items I have been considering:
  
update RAM from 8gb to 16gb
 add additional SSD for boot drive and use full 1TB HDD as storage only
 TBD add external Nvidia GPU
 get a short floor case / shelving to house PC and boot drives
 TBD power backup (storm season in my area)
  
Any suggestions on SSD / Nvidia shelving combos? What other upgrades for this server have I not considered? Not looking to buy expensive NAS, routers, or racks at this time. (Moving in April so my setup is temporary-ish)
 Any advice as I reconfig my boot drive and migrate? I may be early enough that I could just start from scratch but prefer to learn migration process.
 I’m going to post a separate post on my hosting challenges lol.

 I'm not very familiar with server hardware, but as far as I understand I have to buy a Drive Caddy for each drive I'm going to use to keep them in place.
 I looked for caddies on the same website where the server is, and I found these: https://www.interbolt.eu/en/spd/009666/Dell-PowerEdge-SFF-2-5-Cover-Blank-Caddy-Filler-De
 They're way less expensive than these trays I found on the same website: https://www.interbolt.eu/en/spd/007596/Dell-PowerEdge-SFF-2-5-SAS-SATA-HDD-Hot-Swap-Tray
 Now my question is: are cover blank caddy fillers just something to cover empty drive slots? Is there a way to use them with a Hard Drive? If not, do I really have to buy the more expensive caddies?
 Thanks A LOT in advance!

 After a long hiatus due to work and personal issues, I'm back to building my first homelab.
 A quick recap: I'm building a moderate size physical cluster consisting of 9 m-ITX blades each with an i3-10105T, 32Gb DRAM and 512Gb NVME boot drive. Two of the blades have four 2.5" hot swap bays in which I'll have a total of eight 2Tb SSDs.
 There are also two mini-PCs (Bee-link Gti11s that are i5-11s with 16Gb DRAM and 512Gb NVME boot drive). One of them will be a dedicated pfSense firewall (have to use the development build of pfSense 2.7 so it will recognize my i225 NICs) and the other will be running Ubuntu Desktop for an inside the lab management interface.
 When I say inside the lab, I want the everything from the pfSense FW down on its own IP range …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm after a solution to my dire photo management skills. I've got 20k photos on a server. Lots of crud. I'd like to thin the herd a bit.
 I'm looking for a way to go through them on the phone and delete as I swipe through. Ideally it would be swipe->delete->swipe->keep->swipe->delete etc. The process has been surprisingly difficult to come across.
 On the desktop, it's fine. I can use the file manager, but with kids, work, etc, i might not get to the desktop as often as i'd like which is where the phone would come in. I'm after an android app that can see the photos on the server amd delete/keep as is my wont. I don't require organisational tools, or AI, or tagging, or sharing or anything like that. 
 Simple delete/keep->next, repeat ad nauseum. It doesn't have to be a gallery app, maybe a file manager would work, but the thumbnail/preview caching might be problematic.
 I don't know. There are plenty of photo management apps, but really i'm looking for an image previewer and delete button without having to confirm every single time.
 The photos themselves can be in a samba share/ftp/nextcloud instance, doesn't matter, but access from the phone to quickly delete would be incredibly helpful.
 Any ideas appreciated. Thanks.
 Afterthought: I'd be aiming for something from fdroid, but at this point I may have to forego the opensourceness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I wasted my whole weekend. All I wanted to do is create a REST API I could develop a mobile app against. This is the first programming work I’ve done for myself in ages and is widely outside the scope of the kind of work I do for clients. I’m interested in spring because the overtime I’ve been doing has been on a spring project. 
 I found this example by Baeldung after running into dead-ends with other tutorials:
 https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth
 It’s not setup for SSL or running outside of local dev environment. So that’s where I spent my Sunday. 
 I eventually got everything besides actually being able to log out to work. Also technically still have to figure out how disable the management console being reachable from outside the host. 
 Surely there must be a secure, ready to deploy default that can be extended, right? 
 Am I expecting too much to be done for me?

 I would like to make some docker containers accessible from outside of my home. After some Googling, it seems that hosting a VPN seems the way to go. I wanted to double check if that is the best path forward:
  
ddclient for Dynamic DNS (would you use a free service like afraid.org?)
 wireguard for the actual VPN

 Am I missing anything else? I will be running both of those servers in docker.

 i tried searching but could not find a simple and realistic comparrison showing that NAS disk are really better for desktop storage.
 it's mostly for flac and wave music, png, svg and jpg images and mkv, avi and mp4 movies going to migrate to (03) 4tb hard disks , so actually i need to buy 6 for backup reasons, 
 i keep hearing i should buy the seagate ironwolf instead of barracuda, and begs the quesiton if its not overkill? with 6 drives i would spend u$ 120 more with ironwolf. from what i read NAS drives are made to run hot and not get affected from vibrations. isn't that because nas drives are all cramped together in a tiny box?
 so in a big server case both vibrations and temperature will not be a concern right?
 my computer runs rather cold, hard disks usually around 30~35 celsius, (a big old server case from the 2000's) 
 thanks!
 ps: not raid, just manual backup using software that does incremental copy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought 3 identical machines with the initial idea of running SeaweedFS or maybe CEPH or some other type of distributed filesystem.
 Now I'm doubting if I should make more use of the hardware and also add them as docker nodes in my swarm. What would the performance impact be on my filesystem? Could docker somehow get in the way of the filesystem? What are the security implications of running docker containers alongside my filesystem?
 It seems like a waste of resources to only use the 3 machines as filesystem, doesn't it? I am planning to host quite a lot of mini-websites in docker in the future, it's something to keep in mind, but they can be migrated quite easily provided there is shared storage.
 What would you do in this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 In my homelab, I have a synology NAS that has docker running on it with a bunch of containers. One of those containers is a NGINX reverse proxy. Currently, the various UIs for a number of containers, as well as for the synology itself, are running over http. It's all internal, so it's not the end of the world if it isn't https, but I'd like to fix it so that everything does use https. I've noticed in some cases that chrome assumes that sites are https and that things don't work as a result.
 The problem is, none of these things are exposed to the open internet (and I don't want to expose them), so it looks like Let's encrypt is out. Further complicating things, their hostnames are all configured to be subdomains of my main domain (which does have a website out there with a Let's Encrypt cert on it). What's the sanest approach here?
 1) Do whatever shenanigans Let's Encrypt needs at the domain level to get a wildcard cert? What would I need to do to keep child domains updated in this case?
 2) Make a self-signed certificate and trust it on all my devices. How hard will it be to keep NGINX updated with this cert?
 Just needing a bit of guidance here, because when I've dealt with certs, it has either been in a production web environment with a "real" certificate authority or it has been Let's Encrypt provided by a webhost. Not sure what to do in a homelab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using gallery-dl to download media and metadata for a list of people I follow. However, despite using an archive file, it still iterates through their entire tweet history. It does skip downloading old tweets, but I'd rather it just get everything new and then move onto the next URL once it encounters a tweet it already has. That would save me a TON of time (and rate limits).
 All the documentation and suggestions I've found thus far involve skipping downloads, which it's already doing.
 Also, since moving to a new computer and setting things up again, files it already downloaded are displaying as ./gallery-dl/twitter/[user]/? in the terminal output instead of showing the filenames. Not sure why that is happening.
 Config is below. Any suggestions?
 { "extractor": { "twitter": { "cookies": { "auth_token": "[redacted]" }, "archive": "~/twitter/archive-twitter.sqlite3", "postprocessors": [ { "name": "metadata", "event": "post", "filename": "{tweet_id}.json" } ], "expand": false, "cards": false, "quoted": false, "retweets": false, "text-tweets": false, "unique": true, "videos": true, "timeline": { "strategy": "media" } } } } 
 I run with the following command: gallery-dl -c ./gallery-dl.no-text.conf -i urls.txt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to self hosting, and I've read lots of guides and there is something I can't get my head around. Usually people have a reverse proxy for most of their services, so they can be accessed outside of the home network. What I don't understand is - say you have something like radarr.yourdomain.com - it doesn't seem to difficult for someone to guess that URL. If they do, then all that's left stopping them from accessing your services is the authentication from each service. I have been using wireguard for accessing my services outside my home, and it works quite well, and it seems more secure given how big the private keys are etc? I understand using a reverse proxy for a media server, in case you want to share with others or on devices that you can't use a VPN client, but why have it for the other more "private" services?
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you everyone, that makes sense. As for reverse proxies, is it considered secure to use the services own single authentication, like radarr and sonarr, or is it recommended to set up something more complex like authelia? Of course running with SSL.

 I don't get what's imposing the limitation though - it's the same controller, same power - what is there to stop me from putting 2x 16 TB drives in there? Or is it just a hard-limit set by WD for whatever reasons and the NAS simply will not boot with such drives?
 One theory is that the "advertised" capacity is what it is, going by the maximum available HDD size at that time. I can't confirm that though.
 I'd like to find out if maybe someone's already tried it before I buy the drives. Thoughts ?

 I'm looking for a solution to use to store about 2 TB of data (family photos and videos backup) online that does not require me to install an application to do so.
 I've looked at some of the other posts here and have an idea of the major suppliers already, but not which ones offer an option to just map a drive (open to any protocols sorted by linux).
 Does anyone else have this use case and doing this with a provider, please?
 Ideally I'll go with the cheapest cost/year. I don't want nor need anything fancy, just storage space I can map to have another backip of family photos and videos. 
 Thank you in advance.
 Ps- I asked iDrive and tgey responded that I must have their app installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I make this post to get an update of current state of the storage technology and also seek to find answer for wheather i should make backups to HDDs vs SSD.
 Current Situation:- I have around 500 gb of Family photos from 2001 on a Seagate external HDD, it lasted for 7 years and data is well and good right now.
 I already have backups on 2 different machines and the external HDD. It's now time again to migrate my external HDD to new Hardware and I am conflicted on what should I choose moving further.
 Until now my photos have been jumping CDs to HDD and I am at a crossroads again weather to switch from HDD to SSD or HDD are still better for cold storage long term.
 I did fair bit of research and I am aware Optical Media would be my best bet, namely M Disk or BD disks. Unfortunately where I live I cannot source them reliably and affordably enough.
 I browsed reddit threads from past few years. Like this from 2 years ago which says SSDs are better.
 I have consistently found a narrative that newer SSDs are better alternative than HDDs.
 My primary concern is not number of read writes in SSDs. Often they are in 100s of TBW which I presume I won't hit because of the nature of my storage needs.
 I fear data corruption and chip failure rather than running out of read writes.
 The disk I chose weather SSD or an HDD will probably be left on shelf with about twice a year plugging into PC to add new photos.
 What do you guys think would be a good choice ?
 Should I keep moving forward with a new HDD or are SSD a smarter choice?
 Whatever I choose I would probably rely on for at least next 4-5 years, with backups of course.

 as my NAS is a bit dumb (ie Synology locked it down to only install something from their package manager), I was hoping to use my Raspberry Pi as a Jellyfin server.
 I am however having issues mounting the shared folder on Raspbian.
 I followed the instructions at https://www.gavingreer.com/2020/03/06/synology-nfs-mount but when I try to mount the drive, I don't get the expected results:
 $ sudo mount 192.168.178.69:/volume1/video /media/nas/video $ df -h | grep /media/nas/video/ $ ls /media/nas/video/ ls: cannot open directory '/media/nas/video/': Permission denied 
 Anyone any idea what I might be missing?

 The reason for encryption is that this is a vultr vps, not my hardware. If it was I wouldn't mind with radicale as a solution but as it isn't I would like if there is something if possible. If not will have to continue with radicale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey selfhosters, 
 I've recently had a problem with some apps that I'm selfhosting for our company being reported to google as phishing, including our website. This caused some issues last week as our website is listed in our signatures and Gmail flagged all our outgoing mails as phishing attempts.
 Additionally, one of the domains that has been reported is nothing more than a Bookstack wiki protected with Cloudflare Zero Trust, even if you get past Zero Trust, you'll still need to login to Bookstack. There's definitely no phishing or even anything to download there. I suspect we're being fake report bombed by someone for reasons unknown to me.
 It's causing some issues with my colleagues accessing the necessary tools we need to use if they happen to be using Chrome as their browser. Has anyone had experience with such a situation before? Apart from submitting an Incorrect Phishing Warning report, is there anything else I can do? I seriously doubt our servers have been compromised, I've looked at the logs and there's nothing that would hint at suspicious activity.
 Thanks in advance.

 I got some Intel FTLX8571D3BCV-IT SFP+ connectors for my 10gbs fiber homelab setup. I wasted a week trying to get them to work.
 Despite them being listed as 1gbs/10gbs compatible connector, they were never able to actually connect at 10gbs. ethtool even showed supported modes as 10000baseCR/Full and 10000baseSR/Full, but that's a load of BS.
 I compiled the intel ixgbe driver by hand and it still didn't help. Confirmed fiber cables and switch were known good by swapping out parts - it is definitely the FTLX8571D3BCV connectors being dumb.
 After checking online, seems this is a known issue. Want to spread the word here on reddit as well so that no one else gets bit by this buggy hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All AWS storage products charge outrageous egress fees, to the extend that backing up to AWS doesn't seem feasible for me. It's like Hotel California: upload is free, storage cost is okay, but you want your data back? Payback!
 For example: s3 glacier us-east-1: $0.0036 per GB + $0.09 per GB egress (for first 10tb).
 https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
 So if I backup 10 tb to aws and download it back at end of 1 year, it'll cost (0.0036 * 1024 * 10 * 12)+(0.09 * 1024 * 10)=442+921, i.e. 67% of my expense goes to egress. 
 I'm like...no f way. Until I saw something else they offered: workdoc! Apparently there's no charge on egress. I reread it trice but yeah. $5 per user with 1tb included. You can allocate more storage per user but that'll cost more than creating a second user, so just create 10 users. That works out to 5 * 10 * 12=$600, less than half of glacier, and you don't have to wait 12 hours. Oh and there's a web gui.
 https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/pricing/
 Are they doing this to compete with gdrive? I cannot imagine they omitted egress charges by mistake.

 I could certainly try wiring the extra batteries up to the internal pack but it would likely be really ugly as I might have to drill a hole somewhere in the chassis or leave the front panel off.

 So, like the title says, I would be looking for a self-hostable solution to replace a box like HDHomeRun.
 Basically the idea would be to have a USB or PCIE card adapter to be able to use a TV antenna on my server and basically get the live TV channels it gets and then use them in Plex directly as a DVR exactly as I would with hdhomerun. 
 Currently, I am using xteve for iptv, but I'd like to be able to use a TV antenna, but I don't want to buy a proprietary box like the hdhomerun one.
 Is there a solution that exist out there that anyone knows of? And would it be viable compared to a premade solution? 
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion, and don't hesitate if I'm missing details.

 I have a sizable pile of 5TB, 4TB, 3TB and 2TB drives. I live somewhere where power is cheap and cooling is fresh air for 9 out of 12 months. I have JBODs and "IT" flashed controllers to run more than I have. All told, it's around .5 PB... someday, I'd like to break the PB barrier, but today is not that day.
 Can someone recommend a single software platform to support various disk sizes, reasonable (N+2) resillency and easy growth/failure replacement?
 UNRAID, too few disks. TrueNAS, would need a seperate pool for each disk size, replacement blows. I know next to nothing about OpenMediaVault but am going to fire that up here soon to poke about. I see people complaining about NFS speeds, but in general, I don't need this to be super fast.
 I run a plex server (I actually won't run that as a plugin, even if the platform supports it) that servers up and transcodes 4K HDR content, a few infrastructure VMs and some game servers, but outside of my plex server being a consumer of large disk, I don't have significant performance needs. My VMs I'll either run local or if I feel the need to go back to multiple VM hosts, I'll come up with something seperate from my bulk storage.
 Thanks for perusing my wall of text. Curious what other folks are using for large drive count systems. 
 I'll head off the "12TB refurbs are cheap" response with "there's nothing cheaper than what you already have."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought a R620, my first rack mount server purchase. It came with a 4-port Broadcom network card but I wanted to add some more ports just for fun and to experiment with Proxmox.
 It is an Intel 4-port PCI-E card I pulled from a Dell Optiplex 7040 desktop where it worked fine.
 When I boot the server it seems to initialize, it shows up in the system inventory, but not in the hardware network devices. When I plug a cable into it I get nothing.
 I tried digging around the Life Cycle Controller thinking maybe it had to be manually enabled but didn't see anything that jumped out at me. It is installed currently in PCI-E slot 1, but I have tried the others as well.
 Oddly, Proxmox sees the card (though I have not made use of it there, yet). Is there anything I need to do to get it to show up within the server itself (iDrac web interface, LCC, etc.) or is this just normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So one of the things I'm doing in my lab is maintaining a practice and development environment for multiple languages and frameworks, such as Python, PHP, and even *shudders* Ruby, crossed with various Databases, such as PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, and other tools like rabbitmq, mqtt, and memcached and redis. So I'm thinking about expanding the database assortment into the 'commercial' realm of applications, so I'm looking at setting up an MS server with IIAS and .NET for web development, and databi for both OracleSQL and MSSQL. But licensing. Does anybody have any practical experience running these in the home lab? Do MS and Oracle make these available under home, lab, or student licenses for free or reduced cost? I couldn't even find a "Buy it now" purchase link on Oracle's website, and I'm trudging through their XE process now and finding that the generous '2GB in Memory' limit they place may not be as generous as I thought, since on a stock empty install it's already using over 1.5GB. So how do you license your MSSQL and OracleSQL in your home lab?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just moving my Unraid server across to new hardware based around an ASRock Z790 Pro RS MoBo (have flashed the latest stable BIOS). 
 I originally set up Unraid last month on an old/ repurposed Xeon based Thinkserver TS140.
 I moved the drives across (6TB Seagate, 8TB Seagate, 10TB WD, 18TB WD)
 Plus I'd been running the 2 x 20TB WDs unshucked as the parity drives via USB, so I shucked these and put them in the new case as I now have the PSU and drive bays to handle them.
 When I first turned the new PC on, only the Seagates were detected, both in BIOS & Unraid.
 So I tried taping pin 3 on the WD drives. The 10TB & 18TB are now being detected in BIOS & Unraid, but the 20TBs still aren't being detected.
 The Thinkserver was running in Legacy BIOS mode. The ASRock doesn't have a legacy option (that I can find), so is running as UEFI. Would that affect this?
 Any suggestions of something else I can try to get the 20TBs working?
 Are others using these drives with a recent UEFI only motherboard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequence of events:
  
I have this hdd (TOSHIBA HDTB420EK3AA) and i want to use it to backup some internal drives on a desktop. I write a bash script to do this, i mess up, i corrupt the data, and i have to format it. 
 Trying to format this thing makes my pc freeze so badly i have to hard reset. I try the same with other machines, and different operating systmes, each one freezing aswell. The winner is an old laptop on lubuntu that manages to successfully format the drive in just over an hour. 
 I go back to the first desktop and modify the script, i run it and it kinda works. By looking at rsync output i notice that the average speed is 500 kb/s, reaching 40kb/s at some points. At some point it starts copying an .IPCH file that makes it reach 0 byte/s and then nothing. 
 I decide to exclude this file and other folders containing very large amount of small files, since it looks that the speed slows down especially in these cases. For what i know HDDs are ass in this type of operations but this is just ridiculous. 
 So i stop the rsync, and everything freezes again. I can't even open the file explorer. I boot windows and use diskpart this time, then i install DiskInfo.

 To me it looks very ok, but in the 20 minutes it took me to write this, diskpart managed to go from 0% to 2% in the process of formatting the disk. 
 The disk is almost factory new, but i can't send it back anymore. Any ideas?

 I commonly use sites like keep2share to download files and have been using mullvad to bypass data limitations. Some videos are broken into multiple parts and I often pull my phone out to download simultaneously.
 I was wondering if there was a more efficient way to do this from one device and if I could do something like linking different browser windows to different IP addresses. I am constantly downloading files and am perfectly fine with the time investment it may take to set something like this up.
 I thought of Jdownloader but I think that uses proxies versus a VPN correct? 
 Sorry for the newbie questions

 ​
 I am new here and posting as someone from TrueNAS forum suggested I ask for advice here.
 My plan was to use 3 WD 8 TB Red Plus HDD's with TrueNAS Scale. (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731377-REG/wd_wdbc9v0080hh1_wrsn_8tb_red_plus_cmr.html)
 The rest of the hardware is (an old gaming pc):
 msi x79a-gd45 plus (has 6 SATA Slots)
 i7-4930K
 250GB SSD
 16 GB RAM
 I could not get the HDD's to show up with that machine and I used TrueNAS Scale and Ubuntu on flash drive. I then tried attaching the HDD's one at a time to a WIN10 machine and still couldn't get them to show up. 
 The only way it would show up is in BIOS.
 Then I ordered an external HDD Hub that I plugged into the PC. It showed up and I ran some Linux commands from the TrueNAS Forum recommendations. 
 Please see …]]></summary>

 https://imgur.com/a/1Fp9nfm
 From what I can see there's 4 hookups for the front backplane, and 8 on the rear with only 4 hooked up. With 4 free ports. And only 4 cables to plug into a raid card.
 From what I can tell it looks like two of the front backplane cables goes to the rear backplane, with only two from each free to plug into a raid card.
 I'm coming from a r710 so I'm still a bit of a newbie here. So just want to know if it's all good. I need to get new cables anyhow, as my gear is 8087. So I'll need to buy new cables. Just need to see if I need 4, 8, 12, or what's up.
 Thanks for any and all help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing back and forth on whether or not I should move away from my current NAS solution that is simply just 2x external HDDs connected to a Lenovo SFF (m710q). It is plenty powerful for my few tasks, but I am not super stoked about having to use external drives, since there is obviously no room for internal upgrades. I only need two drives, as I don't need a whole ton of capacity, but like having the failsafe in case of a drive failure. Currently, I am just using robocopy script to copy any changes made on one drive to the other via a scheduled task but have been tinkering with TrueNAS as a more professional solution with less overhead than windows.
 So, my question: is there any inherent downside to using external HDD enclosures and 2.5in drives in a NAS? Obviously, they are slightly more expensive, but less expensive than building a new machine to do the same tasks...

 One year after getting into selfhosting
 I just wanted to share my path to selfhosting so far!My first intention was to host a secure passwordmanager for myself and my family (Vaultwarden).Well I got kind of addicted to selfhosting services and replace comercial services like Google Photos, OneDrive and PasteBin.
 So I want to share my current setup, consisting of some VPS's and home equipment.I'll go through everything I am running on each machine.Maybe I can inspire some of you and if you have questions, just ask away!
 I almost exclusively use Docker / Docker Compose and LXC containers to host services.

 Obviously there are repos like Bitnami, but they're more component services (mysql, rabbitmq, postgres, etc) vs applications.

 When Fal2Ban kicks in, it bans the Cloudflare IPS and therefor, I am still able to authenticate from my TEST IPs....
 Anyone know why this is happening? I am assuming in my reverse proxy I need *something* so that it passes the real IP through, yes? I have tried various settings in the Synology GUI to no avail..
 I am using a special cloudflare.conf file in Fail2Ban to pass it the data it needs to automatically put in the bans...which works, but it ends up banning IPS belonging to Cloudflare... Any guidance appreciated. In Vaultwarden.log it is seeing cloudflare's IP and not the true IPS.

The setup - 9 machines in two areas of the house that I would like to be able to manage from a single chair, USB keyboard and mouse, 1920x1200 monitor.
 
Machines have disparate video connections, so I know I will need adapters from HDMI/DP/VGA to whatever the KVM is using. 
 
I know I should be using IPMI when possible, but only 3 of the 9 machines have this capability.
 
I understand I can run a remotely switchable KVM into a PiKVM or TinyKVM as an option, and I am looking into that as well, but not really seeing cost savings here with a KVM for each room plus the box.
 
I would like to do IP KVM rather than RDP or other remote access, as I would like to be able to deal with everything from the BIOS up, and also …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I figured I'd ask here since a few of you are using Dashy. 
 I've only found 1 issue on the GitHub describing this issue and there's not a lot of traction on it. 
 I am resetting up Dashy on a new server (dockerized) and found that I can't get multiple pages working. When adding a secondary page and clicking it, the dashboard breaks. The best way to describe it is the theme breaks and the new page doesn't load. 
 I've tried using the sample pages from the Dashy docs in case my yml was broken, but I experience the same issue. 
 In the docker compose, I've declared my /opt/dashy/public dir and also the specific config files and nada. 
  volumes: - /opt/dashy/public/mainpage.yml:/app/public/conf.yml - /opt/dashy/public/testpage.yml:/app/public/testpage.yml - /opt/dashy/item-icons:/app/public/item-icons 
 On the original server, it works great. Second and third pages load, but on this new instance, it's broken. 
 Both instances are on the same version (2.1.1)
 Just not sure why multiple pages started giving me such an issue and was wondering if others were having the same issue.

The 710 and 720 boot right into the bios. The 730, on the other hand, boots into a password protected bios. I have tried resetting the cmos and jumping the pins. And none of the instructions on the Google are working either. Does anybody have any ideas. I figure I'm just going to have to replace the motherboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'll know what the unfortunate answer is, but the million dollar question is has anyone found a fast way to calculate the hamming distance between a very very very large set of hashes?
 I have a dataset (that will continue to grow) that I'm planning on granting limited access to the public via way of allowing the user upload an item, then the server checks against the database of hashes, and shows information from similar hashes. The issue is that the database of hashes will be over 500 hundred million.
 From my understanding of finding similar/identical content, hamming distance is the fastest approach in calculating the difference between items? The issue I am seeing is that this must be calculated for each query? So the server is checking the 500 hundred million images each and every time someone wants to check?
 Is there any way to speed this process that I'm not seeing in my research? How do things like deduplication software, or reverse/similiar image searches work so fast? What's their secret? Just more compute and they're harnessing a shit ton of compute for each query? TinEye claims to be able to "search a 57.6 billion web image index in real-time." but how?? This must be the KFC's secret herbs and spices or the Coke recipe and I'm just shit out of luck?

 I want to do a small stock of stuff I buy regularly for my home. To be able to never forget what to buy every week, I want to generate a dynamic list every X days. 
 I am looking for a inventory management solution. Usage: home / personal 
 Requirements : - home inventory management - manage available products with price, quantity and details (such as consumption time, that means in how many days is each product consumed) - manage list of recursive stuff to buy - access to an overview of the quantity of the products that I have in my stock and when I will have to renew them. - set notifications (emails or push) to notify me when a product inventory is lower than a certain quantity - creates automatically s list of products I need to rebuy every fix time (ex. Every week). - responsive design -self hosted
 I know that a lot of solutions exist for inventory management, but I can't try them all and I am sure that some of you have some propositions.
 Thank you for your help.

I have loads of stuff that I've collected through the years in several HDDs and SSDs, maybe a dozen or more in total. I was considering getting a NAS so that I can lower the risk of losing anything and also make everything accessible to me easily. 
 What I'm most concerned about is availability/reliability. AWS guarantees 99,999999999%. That's not something you can get at home. There are so many ways to just mess up. The cost to scale is also very linear for AWS, compared to a home system.
 I have unlimited Internet already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on trying to solidify my backup strategy. I do think it's fairly solid, but there are a couple things I know that I can do better. 
 Current strategy: Centralized storage via Synology NAS (1621+ w/ 32GB ECC RAM) with btrfs. NAS snapshots hourly and maintains snapshot through typical pruning measures. NAS backs up to connected Seagate Backup 8TB drive and Backblaze B2 via Hyper Backup. NUC11 running Windows with read-only user connects to shares and backs up to connected external hard drive via Arq 7. Have rotational cold-storage via Arq as well. 
 A couple things I'd like to fix: 
  
NUC11 running Windows (will likely convert to Hypervisor of some sort, even if just HyperV), was part of a project.
 Potentially move the external drive hanging off of the NUC to an internal 2.5 HDD.
 Add a backup tool that is open source, even if it's just a cold backup. 
 Potentially remove NUC11 in general, as I'm running less on it and have a beefy desktop, and far fewer full-time running services than I did. Would move the service or two to run off of the NAS. Though, this would mean trying to incorporate my desktop into initiating a backup process of some sort, potentially manually, which makes it less desirable.
  
The amount of data that I would consider critical is very low, somewhere in between 200-300GB
 Any suggestions on how I could make this more solid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I ended up setting up a cloudflare tunnel. Previously I had been utilizing nginx proxy manager and exposed ports 80 & 443 to the internet. It was working fine, but after reading about cloudflares tunnel I determined why continue to expose ports to the internet.
 Tunnel works great, I can go to ha.mydoman.com and it brings me to home assisstant. Did the same thing with jellyfin. Then I realized when using the domain name internally it was being treated as if I was connecting externally and forcing jellyfin to transcode the videos when on my local network. This makes sense since the dns is now being routed to cloudflare back home. Previously with nginx i used hairpin nat to keep all traffic local.
 I setup dns override in unbound to point to the IP address of NGINX (using Opnsense firewall). I flushed my dns and when I ping that domain it shows the IP. In NGINX I still have setup to use the host ha.mydomain.com . 
 ​
 However, when on my internal network when I go to ha.mydomain.com I get a connection refused. So I suspect the domain or something isn't properly getting passed to nginx? Therefore it can't resolve properly. When I do ha.mydomain.com:8989/sonarr I can get to sonarr (it requires the port to be specified - otherwise connection refused) via NGINX so something odd is going on. What is the best place to look? Bit stumped at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have needed a UPSS for a while but I keep putting it off due to cost, features, lifespan, support, etc. but maybe you can recommend something that meets the criteria I have? 
 Features required to make it "the one for me":
  
Network interface for SNMP/alerts/monitoring/etc.
 Battery replacement for when the day comes
 1 or 2U rack mountable
  
Power requirements (what will it run during a power outage):
  
1 PA-440 firewall
 1 Unifi 48 port POE switch
 1 Arris SB6190 modem (do not care if this gracefully shuts down but needed for any alerts)
 2 ESX servers running on old low power Dell OptiPlex hardware
 1 NAS server also running on old low power OptiPlex hardware
  
A huge concern I have is that power will go out in the middle of the night so it would be nice to have the UPS be smart enough to trigger some sort of API calls or scripted shutdowns but at the very least send some sort of alert to my phone to wake me up for manual shut downs. If the hardware itself sounds an alarm there is no way I will hear it from 3 floors up while sleeping. Am I just dreaming a perfect UPS or does something exist that can do "all the things"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a NAS for backup, media server, VMs, etc. It's only serving myself, so I don't like the idea of spinning 6+ spinning up drives up/down when I occasionally need to access a few media files daily when when I reboot for maintenance, testing, or just don't use it for maybe weeks at a time max.
 As I understand, SSDs rarely fail aside from reaching write limit, which is something measurable (and even then, I've heard of people having Samsung SSDs that are nearly twice the TBW that's in the spec). I don't plan on running RAID, since downtime and access to massive amount of data isn't important to me--instead, I prefer frequent incremental backups, occasional full backups, as well as longer life of drives and lower power consumption.
 I will only ever deal with 8-16TB worth of data I want online at the moment, rest is cold storage (combined total of ~100TB hard limit for the foreseeable, I only have 60TB data total). I prefer high TBW because performance is not important for me and backing up constant flow of new large media files is.
 Assuming high TBW SSDs are suitable for such a use case, what high TBW SSDs do you recommend? I was initially looking at Samsung SSDs because they are the gold standard in general, but I've come across Intel DC S3610 as a recommendation that is spec'd ~5x TBW more (10.7PB). I'm not normally one to look for used storage but people seem to have success with used ones from Ebay that are probably pulled from servers after their intended service and they usually a reasonable amount of remaining life at a great price. Unless these somehow fail in other ways, I don't see how they aren't very popular. This model is 7 years old though, so I'm thinking there might be better options (not necessarily price/TB).
 Any thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I recently got an old Toshiba T1000LE from a relative. Unfortunately I opened it up and there are a lot of bad caps and corrosion on the main board, but the hard disk seems fine (model is JVC JDE2825P30-7, a standard 2.5" IDE) so I removed it from the machine to recover the files.
 Problem is my w10 computer can't seem to recognize or read anything from this drive. Assuming it's still working (it powers on and spins up) is there a way to recover files on it? Or to make it readable?
 I usually do this procedure for machines that mount more recent os (from w95 on) so I'm not really practical with hard drives this old. Original computer mounts MS-DOS 3.3, it's from 1990, the HDD is 20 mb.
 Thanks a lot in advance!!

I also scan documents with my cell phone (Android Genius Scan) and here the scan is now and then not scanable with OCR ( text is like "t e x t" instead of "text" and so not searchable). So rework is necessary. Now it would be good if paperless would automatically tag all scans from Genius Scan. Only I can only specify the filename when scanning, but paperless doesn't seem to search it. Do you guys know a solution? Thanks.

 Free and open source, but the most unpolished. You may spend lots of time trying to get certain things to work and fail in the end. 
 As far as I can tell, it's a "simpler and possibly slightly more user-friendly" version of Mautic. 
 Some things are better than Sendy, others worse. Overall I prefer Listmonk, especially since it's free and open source.

Nextcloud ( using linuxserver.io image ) doesn't work (despite connecting to the database and creating table) but I think it's due to my configuration so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Coder use some PostgreSQL specific function not implemented in CockroachDB
 Wakapi doesn't work for the migration ( an issue is opened if you want to take a look) 
  
I may be out of luck and I will revert back to a simple PostgreSQL container but does any of you use CockroachDB for his selfhosted environnement or have an alternative more compatible ?

 Any suggestions what would be the best for this? I was looking at Intel NUCs but decieded to ask here if you have any better ideas.
 Also it would have to be pretty quiet, since I live in the apartment where the living room and bedroom are the same room 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a self-hostable service that I can send live video to (with OBS for example) that has seamless pause and rewind. By this I mean very specifically, I want to be able to watch the live stream in real time and be able to pause or rewind the live stream and be able to go back to real-time. I use a browser extension called Video Speed Controller, and with this if I ever need to pause or rewind a stream I can increase playback speed and slowly work my way back to real-time. Hopefully that makes sense.
 My use for this would be to capture live Twitch streams with streamlink, then re-stream it via OBS to this self-hosted stream so that I can pause and rewind, because Twitch's player does not offer these very basic features. Currently I can achieve exactly the functionality I desire with YouTube's live streaming service, but I feel kinda icky about broadcasting someone else's Twitch live stream onto my own YouTube, even if it is a private/unlisted stream intended exclusively for my own use.
 It would also be ideal if it works with a reverse proxy so that I can use it away from home securely.
 I've briefly looked into Owncast but it does not appear to have the DVR functionality. I haven't set up an Owncast server yet to actually investigate, but I figure if it doesn't advertise that feature then it's unlikely to have it.
 Does anyone know of anything like this? Thank you.

I'm aware Apple's Content Caching feature is meant to do exactly this, but does it have version limitations? As in, can a system running macOS Catalina 10.15.7 store and host updates for macOS 11/12/13? What about for older versions, like 10.11 or 10.13? Does the server OS losing security update support mean it won't be able to fetch updates for peer machines on newer OSes either? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright guys, get your xkcds ready! I programmed yet another monitoring and alarming tool because I couldn't find one I like for the use case I'm targeting. It's pretty basic right now as it only has two types of checks (filesystem and memory usage) and a bunch of actions (e-mail, log, process and webhook). As the (not very creative) name suggests, it's quite minimal in terms of configuration and code. It's also super easy to extend (which I will do; see the roadmap). It's only for Linux (for now..).
 Feedback and contributions are very welcome!

 Bit of a background on me: I hate subscription services. Whether I am paying monthly to watch movies/ tv shows, listen to music, play video games, or even just store data on someone else's computer ("cloud"), I hate it. At this point, I would rather spend exponentially more than I ever would for the subscriptions if it means I get to build/own it. Having said that, I don't really have a specific budget in mind, but I am okay with this being a costly venture that takes a couple of years to perfect.

 ​
 Up until now I controlled those servers over windows RDP however now that I have these new screens I want to have finer control over the resolution so I can scale it by clicking and dragging the corner like I would any other window. I tried NoMachine but for some reason that I can't figure out, NoMachine is bugging out on my win server 2019 system (the main server) greying out the "share screen" option. I don't need external access I just want something that is locally hosted and is better than the garbage built-in RDP (and free)
 ​
 Any suggestions. Thanks

Then I turned off my pc, when I went to turn it on again it won't boot. It will keep having a black screen and as soon as I disconnect the data cable from my new HDD it will boot.
 I tried many times and I really don't understand what happened. I tried searching online but can't find a fix to my problem.
 Any idea ? 
 P.s. I can see it in the bios Edit: I did boot my pc and then connected the sata to the HDD, it took a while but then it showed in disk manager as RAW. I still can't access it and anything I try to do to it takes forever and never gets done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want a robust set-up for exactly three things:
 - Backing up my computer and lap-top. Right now, I use Acronis to back them both up to the same external hard drive and to the Acronis cloud.
 - Backing up very large (hundreds of GBs, into TBs) of .csv data. These are very large health-care database sets that I use professionally. Right now, I store them on an external hard drive (separate from the computer back-up one) and on Google Cloud Storage.
 - I would like to start a personal PLEX media server.
 I am new to home networking and data-hoarding but my ideal set-up would include some of the following features:
 - As much automation as possible. I have a desktop (hard-wired to network) and a laptop (WiFi). Ideally, my desktop backups will occur on a regularly scheduled basis and my laptop whenever on my home network and/or docked at home.
 - Robust to failure; I think I want on-site, off-site, and remote (cloud) back-ups.
 - The ability to access my storage remotely (i.e., access my PLEX server while traveling for work, etc.).
 I'm prepared to read a lot and make purchases and effort as necessary, I just can't figure out where to start, the sheer amount of information and terms are overwhelming.

So far nearly everything I have laying around shows a "fault detected on drive" error - even on new drives. The only ones I've found so far that work are teamgroup vulcan g (not z).
 Anyone know of any others that work? Would I have better luck with a different raid controller?
 Edit: Updating to solved. Looks like samsung evo ssds are the way to go - and an update to the h710 or h710p to improve performance. Thanks for the help guys!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a case that will hold at least 6 3.5" drives while simultaneously holding a full gaming PC build. I won't be using liquid cooling so no need of a radiator. I don't want to do a separate build due to power consumption and physical space limitations. I'm the only one that uses the server so I don't need a separate NAS.
 I've been looking at the Fractal Design Define 7 XL but I'm not sure I like the price and the size. I don't really need 18 drives so I could do fine with something smaller but middle-ground options seem to be somewhat limited.
 I would also prefer light tempered glass to dark if possible and I definitely want a side window.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: need help deciding on how to upgrade my system. 1: utilize JBOD W/ UnRaid 2: new server system (specs at bottom)
 Hey guys, I have been hoarding on a system I build last year which is utilizing Linux mint as the OS. It has served me well but I’m running out of space (seems like a common issue here) and only have enough sata connections and power for 2 more drives in the current case and configuration. When I set everything up I basically had no clue what I was doing and everything is all over the place and hard to find/archive my data. After about a year of researching what my needs/wants are I’m wanting to switch to running UnRaid on my system which would mean a complete wipe of everything as far as I understand. I am contemplating buying a second computer and setting everything up and then migrating over to it with the old system used as a back up for my important files. I found a local built NAS for sale for $400 (specs below) or can I utilize Unraid on a small HP computer and add drive via a usb JBOD?
 Processor: AMD FX 4300
 Motherboard: ASUS M6A97 (Supports DDR3 ECC memory)
 RAM: 16 GB (4X4GB) DDR3 ECC 1333Mhz
 Video Card: Nvidia Quadro 510S
 Dell PERC 710 RAID Card (Supports RAID 0,1,5,6,10,50)
 Hard Drives: 2x Samsung 860 EVO 500GB, 6x HGST 4TB HDD, and 1x Western Digital 6TB HDD.

I've been wanting to share an external Drive I have (Drobo) connected to my windows machine with the linux side. Just a few folders to be able to read/write/ and execute from both OS's and the regular user. 
 Here's the rub and mind you I'm still learning linux and getting these services running is just part of my learning process.
 I've been running:
 "sudo mount.cifs //ip/Downloads /home/user/Downloads -o user=username"
 to share a Downloads folder on my Drobo with the one I specify on linux but everytime I run it, though it does allow me to read the content I cannot write. Despite attempting to chmod permissions it will only write for the root user. I've attempted to change to permissions at the root level and still keep running into a road block. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing here but figured I'd throw it out to the the ether and see if I got some kind of idea.

 Thanks!

 just wanted to ask around a little bit regarding regular home use drives that are currently available.
 I was looking to expand my regular PC storage with something like a 2TB drive. Then I noticed that my current 5y/o WD Blue 1TB did accumulate some bad sectors and image backup failed due to some read errors.So it was time to get a new drive not just to expand but to replace that drive. The use of this drive being as a secondary drive for installing programs and stuff that doesn't need SSD levels of speed, but certainly not just storing data long term.
 Looking into what drives are currently available I quickly came upon the SMR vs CMR debacle and noticed that all WD Blue drives above 1TB use SMR (same for larger seagate barracudas). I did some research on that and really heard so…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi reddit fam,
 ​
 I have a question that I could use some advice. I have a 4 bay Synology Nas with 32TB configured with RAID 5 I think, with 1 drive parity so I have 24TB of usable storage. I have over 20tb backed up to BackBlaze with retention of 14 days. I am paying like $140 a month right now. I also got a T-Mobile promotion which gives me 2TB + Unlimited Google Photos for $15 a month and since I use the 2TB for work, I thought it was a no brainer.
 ​
 I am wanting to change my offsite backup storage. I am thinking of purchasing another 4 bay NAS or building a cheap one, storing at my parent's business, which is a motel, and using that as a backup target over paying for BackBlaze. I was thinking of making it a bit beefier and having more storage so they can store their surveillance footage on the NAS locally and I can use it as a backup target. Curious on pros/cons of getting rid of BackBlaze and taking care of my own offsite backup.
 ​
 I have 2Gig up/down at my home, and my parents business has a 400/40 mbps internet connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I set up a USB TTL connection to the serial port on some Seagate hard drives and managed to 'repair' some that had bad sectors (G-list entries) by issuing a low level format command that tested every sector. 
 This process took twice as long as a normal erase or format and any sectors that were deemed unsatisfactory were placed into the 'resident G-list' (which is similar to the factory defect list aka P-list in that the sectors are skipped over rather than reassigned so there is no performance loss).
 One drive had only a handful of bad sectors while the other had a few thousand. I am wondering if these 'refurbished' drives are now 'good as new' or should still be sent to recycling.
 More info on Seagate terminal commands here. warning issuing the wrong command or making a typo could lead to data loss so do not connect to the serial port of a drive containing important data
 Note: this only works on older drives that do not have the serial port locked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI all, I'm trying to figure out how to get PVE to stay updated while hosting my router. I've got pfSense running as my main home firewall, virtualized in Proxmox, running on one of those Topton N5015 4-interface boxes. NICs are used as follows:
  
WAN (PCI passthrough, to cable modem)
 LAN (PCI passthrough, pfSense at 192.168.1.1)
 (unused)
 Proxmox management (192.160.0.100)
  
The interaction with Proxmox here is kind of clunky. I don't have a management network or anything, so if I want to log into the PVE on this one, I have to go down into the basement where this thing lives, and directly plug in an a cable, and set a static IP and finally connect. That's clunky but workable. The real issue is that PVE can't see the internet, and therefore can't get updates or anything. And if I want to run other services on PVE here, they don't run on my LAN network, and they can't see the internet either.
 The real issue to solve is getting updates for PVE. Any tips on how to do that? It seems like I could use NIC 3 to connect into the LAN - and connect to the internet in a sort of Inception-style labyrinth. Is that wise or even possible? Is there some way to update PVE offline with a usb stick or something?
 (I suppose one solution is to ditch proxmox and run pfSense bare metal. I liked the idea of being able to snapshot my firewall in case anything goes wrong, and the little Topton unit is almost overpowered to just run as a firewall, so I figured it would be nice to use any extra power for other services. But I am open to running bare metal if it makes more sense.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. It's been a while since I've used Glacier, the last time it being such a pain I deleted my account just to get rid of it. It seems its usability has improved with its rework into S3 Glacier Deep Archive and when I just compared the pricing to the Synology C2 service I've been using for years to take care of my few TB of media, it's 8x cheaper! Not considering the hefty but rare to incur retrieval costs, of course.
 So far everything has been going swimmingly, my Synology NAS just configured to use the Glacier Backup app (first time I use it, so far used only Hyper Backup to Syno C2) service with a small test folder into my new AWS account. I know enough to be suspicious of Glacier, so I'd love you people's advice on a few points...
 VERSION CONTROL:
 If I have to full restore from backup, I want to restore to the last daily state I backed up, not every file I've ever had, so I've disabled the following:
 https://preview.redd.it/doxpu31g4i6a1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3866059ae4ec6409c40c957d9fefa569f4d9b490
 Is VC something I'd be giving up, with only the last point to restore from unless I choose to never delete from Glacier locally deleted files? That would be a fatally flawed concept for retrieving accidentally deleted files!
 Currently I benefit from version controlled backups in C2, with deduplication making it possible to not pay insane amounts for that.
 MOVING FILES = DUPLICATION?
 When I move a folder around my NAS, does that schedule it for deletion in Glacier then recreate it next time a backup kicks off? If so, it could prove very pricy with Glacier's "pay 3 months minimum" storage model...
 Thanks in advance, I appreciate partial answers too, as well as advice about other Gotchas I may not have thought of!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm probably missing something, but I'd like:
  
use tailscale as my "VPN" into my network
 use simple hosts like bitwarden.home.mydomain.com to access resources
 protect my bitwarden_rs instance with https (hopefully be able to use the native apps instead of the website)
 make it simple to manage (no self-hosted certs installed on end devices)
 not expose my proxy to the public web (egress is fine)
 and do it for free (other than the purchase of the domain)
  
My thought was to create a DNS record in CF that points to a reserved IP, "10.5.5.14". Then on "10.5.5.14", setup a reverse proxy entry with the cert provided by CF.
 I'm guessing this isn't possible as the edge certs can only be used if you proxy requests through CF network, which isn't possible because I'm within a reserved IP range.
 Is there another way to achieve what I want to do?

 I know the HW is kinda old but wondering if anyone else here have gone through the same thing and can confirm the cpu is a drop in replacement. 
 Thanks!

 If i have Adguard runnning on port 80 , i need this port to have my DNS working on Adguard, but i want that my dashboard to run also on this port, like i want to just type myaddress.com or 192.168.1.20 to display my dashboard without my dns not working. 
 How can i do that ? I tried reading some documentation but i couldn't understand.
 I know you can use ngninx port forwarding, but will my dns work if 80 is not the port for my dns ?

 To be more precise. I have NordVPN and want the Chromecast on my network to have its traffic go via NordVPN.
 The chromecast doesn’t support VPN settings as far as I know. My router (TP Link ER605) supports policy routing and VPN. But not NordVPN. 
 Is there a way to have a very simple virtual router that supports NordVPN ? Preferably as a docker container. 
 My idea would be to create a second wireless network on my ubiquity AP with this virtual router as a gateway. Not sure if it would work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've been using Plex for a very long time. Starting with my PC as the server, then moved to a hosted VPS, and currently I'm using a Seedbox.
 The Seedbox is extremely powerful and meets all my needs, but it's getting fairly expensive upgrading storage to a higher capacity.
 I would like your opinions about self hosted solutions. I'm open to using Nas devices, or even building another PC to support it. I currently have an nVidia 1080 that I can utilize for that purpose. The only thing I need, is a solution / device that would do the transcoding on its own, because I don't want to use my PC for that. 
 I'm currently serving about 4 users and max simultaneously transcoding is 2-3. Also serving 4k content so I need a device that's powerful enough.
 I'm also looking for the cheapest solution that can be used for this purpose.
 Greatly appriciate your input!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Hoarders,
 Recently I've purchased two HP Ultrium 920 tape drives with a single IBM lto-3 ultrium tape. One of those drives accepted my LTO tape, but got fried shortly afterwards (remember kids, modular power supplies can have mirrored 12V-5V if you're not using original cabling~ ) The second one powers up fine, but rejects the tape, basically, ejects it few seconds after inserting it and flashes the "Tape" LED.
 I'm thinking that aside from worn out drive it might be the cause of old firmware. I was wondering if anybody has that firmware. HP has the download blocked behind extended support.
 ​
 HP Library and Tape Tools sees the drive as below:
  
Product ID : Ultrium 1-SCSI [HH] 
 Drive Technology : LTO 
 Mech. Serial Number : HU10927KPF 
 Firmware Rev : P61D/Standalone 
 Target ID : 3 
 Target LUN : 0 
 OBDR Capability : Supported 
 WORM Capability : Not Supported 
 Firmware : P61D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi to everyone,
 I'm really new here and very newbie at this topic. But I've been reading a lot since some time ago.
 I want to host some services at home, but I really don't know how to match all my ideas.
 First, I'm going to change my router's ISP Provider. I think I'm going to buy a Netgear x4s R7800 and to install OpenWRT on it. I was about to buy a a Turris Omnia for 170€, but it was out of my price range. And I can get the Netgear for just 60€.
 Second, I have a Qnap TS-431P2 with 8GB and 2x10TB HDD. But I'd like to sell it because I'd like to install another OS, like Debian.
 I'd like to have these services at home, only for LAN accessing:
 - OpenMediaVault? I have thousands of photos, and we'd like to backup my photos from our android and laptop devices.
 - Nextcloud.
 - Suricata to monitor all my network.
 - Some application to see the all the photos.
 - Pi-hole.
 Then, I've thought to get a device like a mini-pc to handle all of that. Install a linux on it, and create all that services as containers. Is it possible to do it like that? First I thought to buy a Rpi 4 8GB, but I've seen a Fujitsu Q920, which I think is better, and I can get one second handly even cheaper than a Rpi. Any other better HW solution?
 Please, any comments, advices or links would be really appreciated.
 Thank you in advance.

It went back to looking at how the dashboard did months ago before the alleged storage limit was put in place. I'm on the Enterprise Plus plan.
 I'm a single-user organization.
 Can anyone else verify that the limit language is gone for them (Enterprise Standard and Enterprise Plus only)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty burned out after the whole cyberpower fiasco, thank god for costco's 1 year return policy at least.
 I don't think i'll be able to go without a UPS again, the power lines entering my neighborhood will fall if you look at them funny and it's been useful more than a dozen times this year and it saved me from quite an extreme brownout we had a few months ago. I've been looking around online and here's what I've been looking for.
 - ~1500VA
 - 900+W
 - Pure Sinewave 
 I've heard quite a lot of good things about Eaton and thus i've been looking at the Eaton 5SC1500 recently, however the only thing holding me back is all the reviews and mentions online about the fan noise. 
 Specs are listing 40dB at 1m, that's insane. I have my UPS under my desk and I sleep in the same room, from what I've heard the fan runs 24/7 and not just when the inverter is running, I wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't so loud though. 
 I've heard about some people replacing the fan with a noctuca fan but I'm not sure if i'm comfortable with this, a lot of the posts mentioning this don't specifically mention which model they're working on so I'd rather not just go out and replace the fan off a vague guide. 
 It's really a bummer given that everything else about the UPS sounds perfect and is as close as it gets to the cp1500pfclcd.
 Does anyone have any ideas? Either towards the eaton unit or some other recommendations, I'm quite busy day to day and in my spare time i've been trying to look around for something that doesn't break the bank (<$500) but my attempts seem to be futile and it's getting really tiring.

Everything has been running well, but given that I've been throwing 150 gig archives to it constantly, I decided it was time to upgrade from the base nic to one with 10GbE capabilities in a direct attach/peer to peer config with my main desktop. The x540 with 2 RJ45 10GbE and 2 1GbE ports installed nicely and has connected to my 1GbE network albeit limited to the slower speeds.
 My current issue is getting my desktop to connect to the R720. Turns out the card I purchased is an x540 Convergence Network Adapter. After installing the drivers from Intel, I'm not getting any network activity when plugged into the R720 nor when plugged into the switch (I've tried a crossover cable and a patch cable). 
 Am I missing anything or do I need to find another NIC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been offered a security position as a promotion from my current “help desk masquerading as Jr sys admin” role that I’ve had. So many of the interview questions weren’t things I encountered in my day to day work life, but are things I’m at least beginning to understand thanks to my homelab and self-hosted projects!
 That’s all I came to say. To everyone else that’s plugging away in their homelabs, never discount the value the knowledge you’re accumulating. 
 I’m trying to figure out what my reward should be once this change makes its way to my paychecks… expand the capabilities of my proxmox cluster with another node, with more ram for an existing node, of by getting myself a legacy Unix workstation (Sun or SGI)…. I know what will pay off in the long term; it’s just not nearly as fun sounding compared to other idea, which will be self gratifying but completely useless :)

 To save rack space, I was considering either virtualizing TrueNAS or using possibly Windows Server Storage Spaces and direct attaching it to the R720 instead. Has anyone have experience with a TrueNAS virtualized and using a disk shelf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to share 2x 4tb NAS type hard disks for all my home computers. Right now due to limitations I'm not able to put together a NAS type of PC, but maybe in the future I will properly set it up. So the idea is to use them in my main desktop computer using samba share.
 I will store important data (precious personal stuff) and movies, so my main concern is to reduce the possibility of corruption or loss of data. I don't care too much for the speed of the share. What is the most robust configuration for this?
 I firstly thought to use them as RAID1, but as I'm reading more forums, the more I get the idea that maybe it's overkill. Maybe it's better to make a backup once a week for example and leave the possible problems of RAID missconfigurations? I'm a newbie for RAID configs.
 The other thing is the hard disk file system. Right now I'm between ZFS and EXT4. Same as before, I heard that there is not much difference between them for my size and tasks, but any little improvement over data integrity is appreciated.
 Just in case it's important, my PC has 16gb ram ddr4 and it has a mid modern cpu.

I'm still struggling with Authentic LDAP, but I have OIDC and plex authentication working, so I feel well on my way there.
 Now I want to add crowdsec to secure NPM..... I got crowdsec up and running, but once I ingested the NPM logs, I found out that NPM sees all traffic originating from 127.24.0.1.
 I tried setting up macvlan and when I put NPM on there I could hit the management interface on its new IP from my PC, but my router couldn't see it to set the port forwards, so I revered to the bridge network.
 I've seen several guides saying this can be achieved by setting real IP headers in nginx.conf, but NPM doesn't have (at least mine doesn't) that file. ./data/nginx/default_host/site.conf is the closest thing I can find in my set-up following the official NPM install docs.
 Any pointers on how to log real IPs in a docker NPM would be greatly appreciated. 
 Or if anyone knows a better way to set up crowdsec on synology, I'd love to hear those suggestions as well.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have experiences with or thoughts on SATA power switches like these (not necessarily that brand)--are they simple and foolproof or considered hacky and not worthy of risking your disks on? I would assume SATA is conducive to this if hotswapping is a thing that can be supported.
 I have external drives for cold storage littered on my workspace and I want to chuck them in my server (Node 304 case). Unfortunately, the USB-SATA logic board on the WD Reds from the Easystores don't fit into the mounting system of the case, hence I'm wondering if the SATA power switch allows me to turn on the drives every few months or so for the occasional access.
 Alternatively I'm thinking of something like this USB-SATA adapter (https://www.amazon.com/Indicators-External-Converter-Computer-Transfer/dp/B017CO5FJM/) (not necessarily this particular brand) and hook up the AC adapter to a power strip with switches for individual outlets to turn the drives on/off. This seems to be the same as the builtin logic boards in functionality but should be drive brand agnostic (e.g. WD logic boards may not necessarily be compatible with Seagate drives, at least without some mods). It is messier and uses USB3, but I should still be able to wire the cables through the PCIe slot and plug in the AC adapters to a power strip with a toggle on/off feature.
 Slight concern is drives not receiving stable power and potentially inducing more wear and tear as a result. 
 I should note I am not interested in spinning down the drives--the drives will be used for months at a time and I will be rebooting the system probably biweekly for maintenance and testing, which will inevitably spin up the disks on startup only for them to be spun down again.
 If neither options are suitable then I suppose I just have to live with the drives on top of the server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now when I am keeping media on two separate backups I just run a a rsync script I created for doing a checksum comparison. Are there any tools out there specifically for validating backups? Say you have three stores, at least two of them should have the same checksum for a vmware image. All three should be the same but if one is off the other two match, then I'd have the script refresh it from one of the other two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I last posted here ~5 months ago about Fireshare, a project that I have been working on to quickly and easily share my game clips via unique links. 
 It got a lot of positive feedback so I thought I would share it again since I've seen a number of people in comments and post since then asking about video sharing solutions. 
 Core Features
  
Share h264 encoded mp4, mov and webm files via unique links
 Set videos as either public vs private. Public videos can be seen by anyone who visits your Fireshare instance. Private videos can only be seen by those with the unique link.
 Public and private upload capabilities.
 Simple setup requires basic knowledge of Docker.
  
You can see it for yourself on my demo site: https://v.fireshare.net 
 The github project: https://github.com/ShaneIsrael/fireshare
 I also have a complete tutorial on self hosting it which you can find here
 You can find other well put together tutorials on setting it up on YouTube and other websites that users have put together as well.
  
Let me know if you have questions and/or if you've used it I would love to hear your feedback. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a macbook, PC, synology NAS, iPhone, some laptops and some raspberry pis.
 I work outside my house quite a lot from my windows laptop or run simple tasks using termius on my iphone. My macbook is always on at home so I usually ssh into it and do my work, sometimes my iphone as well.
 There are some things I cannot do with this, for example if I want to turn on my nas remotely, I can't use my iphone as the app requires you to be on the same network. Also I don't feel safe that I have exposed my devices to the internet like that.
 I want to connect all my devices onto the same network so I can access them anywhere as if they were on the same LAN network. I was looking around at options such as zerotier, nebula, tailscale, headscale, yggdrasil, innernet, openziti, tinc and wireguard and I think wireguard might be my best option as I read that it uses the least amount of resource. Also I want a free and open source and self hosted option.
 I found some of the following tools on github:
 https://github.com/psyhomb/wireguard-tools
 https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird
 https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker
 https://github.com/tonarino/innernet
 I have zero experience setting up networks like this.
 Can I get a recommendation on a good guide and/or which tools I should use to set up the network I desire so any of my devices can be used from anywhere.
 I also understand that some setups require a server to be always on, is there any way around that? I am planning to run the wireguard server from my raspberry pi 3 that also has vaultwarden running. Also must I have a static IP address? My IP address changes sometimes / every few months. If it does, will I be able to easily modify wireguard?
 Also, if there is a better alternative, please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The nginx proxy manager is running in docker and listening to port 80. 
 I set it up so that, at the end, the source is http://example.com and the destination (a web app running in the same server) is http://example.com:5000. In terms of the diagram here 
 https://forums.unraid.net/topic/110245-support-nginx-proxy-manager-npm-official/
 The “Domain name” and “Forward host to” are http://example.com, the port is 5000, and scheme is http. 
 The domain http://example.com:5000 correctly resolves to the expected destination web page. The expectation is that, when I enter http://example.com, it will be forwarded to http://example.com:5000, but it doesn’t. I get a page from NPM that you have successfully set up NPM, but your destination is not correctly set up. 
 What could be wrong? How to troubleshoot?
 Initially I suspected docker networking might be the issue. I thought the destination resolves inside docker, which is not defined. But the NPM docker network is a bridge, so the destination DNS query should be able to get out of the docker and resolve in host. 
 The application in destination also runs in docker, but with ports mapped in the host. As noted, http://example.com:5000 is indeed accessible.
 I tried other destinations also: localhost, internal IP address of the host, docker interface Ip, etc.

 Been doing a ton of reading/research this morning on the topic, but I can’t seem to get on firm ground for a game storage strategy.
 Currently, I have a desktop PC which I built and use to emulate like 8 consoles worth of games. Many of these games are ISOs or folders that take up a lot of space per game.
 I no longer have access to a free unlimited google drive account which I had about 1.5Tb of data on so I need a migration plan.
 I also plan on adding much more data to emulate some of my PS3 games. I’ll probably ideally love to have upwards of 4-5Tb of storage. But I know the SSD price point sucks there. Open to a hybrid drive like Barracuda. I have an internal Barracuda drive and it’s fast to me!
 I’m not overly concerned about redundancy per se as I have the original discs for many of these games. I can get them all ripped again but it would be annoying. I’m primarily concerned about dependability/longevity with performance second.
 I just ordered a 2Tb 2.5 SATA SSD and a USB 3.0 enclosure for it. My PC does not use USB-C ports. I also have available space internally for another M.2 and another 2.5 drive.
 I’d appreciate some insight. I figured external is the way to go for game storage and continue to store the emulator executables on my system (c) m.2 SSD.

 They all seem to work in single CPU systems but the prices vary quite a bit on eBay between these. 
 Should I go for the best combination of price, cores, TDP or is there more to it than that between single, dual, and quadruple capable Xeons?
 It’s to put in a Z440 workstation with 128GB RAM running proxmox. Currently running an E5-1620v4. 
 Main concern is power usage as a kWh is 0.30$ here. Workload is containers and VMs.

 I don't have a rack, but I do have a lot of shelf space, and I have my old workhorse which sits in my basement that deserves some accolades. It's the Ford F150 of virtualization servers. It's running mostly hardware ranging between 2014-2017, but it serves literally everything in my house and has more than enough overhead for anything else I'd require or add to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So backstory: I have 2 NAS systems in my house, one is a Synology box that I'm getting close to 8yrs old on, and another TrueNAS custom made using a Rosewill RSV-L4500 case. One of the drives on my Synology started reporting bad sectors, so I decided to take this as an opportunity to move everything over to TrueNAS and sell off the Synology NAS, just to simplify everything to just one device and to finally go full ZFS.
 My current setup on TrueNAS is a striped pool of mirrored vdevs of 2 8 TB drives each, so about ~28TB of usable space. I want to add another 4 drives, which maxes out the case's drive capacity.
 Adding those 4 drives in the same mirrored pool will give me 46TB in usable space, but it got me thinking if I want to use RAIDZ pools instead for this may drives (12 Total).
 Some basic calculations I did were:
  
MIRROR 6 Groups of 2 8TB drives: 46TB -- adding to existing pool
 RAIDZ1 3 Groups of 4 8TB drives: 67TB 
 RAIDZ1 2 Groups of 6 8TB drives: 74TB 
 RAIDZ1 1 Group of 12 8TB drives: 82TB 
 RAIDZ2 3 Groups of 4 8TB drives: 44TB
 RAIDZ2 2 Groups of 6 8TB drives: 61TB
 RAIDZ2 1 Group of 12 8TB drives: 70TB
  
I understand that mirrored is would be better because rebuilds on failures would be faster than relying on parity etc, but would redoing the pool groups of RAIDZ be better longevity vs usable space? Mostly considering that at this point I can never upgrade this pool again physically (unless I get a different chasis/case but thats a whole other project in itself) but I obviously care about redundancy on failures as well.
 ​
 Does anyone have any recommendations/insights/experiences?

So can I feel proud of the fact that I'm self-hosting things? And can I show off the docker containers to people who are less tech-savvy than me? I want to show them this server that I made.

 This is some sort of philosophical thing that I don't understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all, 
 briefly about my environment:
 Main Server:
 i5-8600 CPU
 32 GB RAM 1 TB SSD
 With Proxmox running my main VM's/Container's.
 Main NAS:
 Qnap TS-451D2
 4x 8TB WD Purple 
 Raid 10
 I am planning a new NAS with 4x 10 TB WD RED, Ryzen 7 2700X and 16 GB RAM And don't know exactly how to implement it.
 Either I would set up a Nextcloud VM in Proxmox, since the hardware is a bit more powerful, and I might want to run other VMs afterwards or even shut down my other compute server.
 Now the question is what is better Proxmox, Unraid or TrueNas?
 In the end, I only want the most stable and failsafe solution, because I am afraid of data loss. Backups will be made, of course.
 A ready-made NAS solution always gives me security, but I need a more powerful NAS, which can also AI image detection.
 Personally, AI image recognition is most important to me as I am looking for a strong tool to manage my images.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Thank you for all comments.

 I am working on the next version of the PoeticMetric (privacy-first Google Analytics alternative), and I am going to make it free and open source. However, I would like to learn how people manage their deployments nowadays, so I can provide easy deployment options. For now, I am thinking of shipping with a production-ready docker-compose.yaml, and kubernetes manifests or helm chart is the only other option I can think of. So, how do you manage your deployments?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 1995 I backed up a machine onto a sizeable stack of floppies using MS-DOS 6.2 MSBACKUP.EXE. I've imaged the discs, pulled them into a VM and confirmed that they're readable... so that's cool. The only issue is that I have no idea what password I would have set on them 27 years ago.
 Since the passwords were max 8 characters, I'm presuming if I could put the set through a password cracker it shouldn't take too long to break it. Problem is I have no idea where to start.
 I've looked to see if the file format is well known (it does not appear to be documented). 
 I've considered trying to write/build some type of automation that runs on top of the VM to automate the keyboard input/screen reading, but I'm not sure what toolset to start with to build that. I'm reasonably technical enough to string together tools with some code/script if someone could point me in the right direction.
 At this point, I'm more curious than anything else as to what's on those disks and if they're truly recoverable this many years later.
 Any thoughts, direction would be appreciated.

It really has very little if any advantage over 2.5" SSD 4TB, which are retailed at $237 the cheapest. The fact is 3.5" HDD are still growing toward higher capacity, while 2.5in HDD market just silently died.
 I'm thinking about to make an offline backup with a 2.5" HDD, but it seems this is not a viable path any more.

Is this something similar to the bulldozer cpu debacle with amd, (Claimed 8 core on a 4 core chip) or is there a bios setting I might be able to access to utilize all cores on all 4 chips?
 Also, is there a way to set the fan speed? It's a bit loud sitting on my desk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using WikiJS for my documentation and such.
 Things I like about WikiJS:
 - Plenty of customization/administration
 - Syncs plain text to S3 storage (using Cloudflare R2)
 Things I don't like about it:
 - Clunky UI, interface, and editor
 - Pages are slow to render
 - Half of the features are "coming soon"
 - Directory structure/hierarchy/navigation is difficult to use properly (at least for me)
 ​
 I was thinking of moving to Bookstack. I already have this installed from when I was testing a few other solutions.
 I've heard issues with Bookstack breaking URL's, is that still an issue I should be worried about?
 I've also heard that if the Bookstack docker/OS dies/corrupts, the data is useless because it uses a database and not plain text. If I sync my docs to S3 storage, are they stored in plain text there or will I need the database? My goal is to be able to have access to all of my documentation if my entire environment collapses. Having plain text files in Cloudflare R2 achieves that goal.
 ​
 *Please do not suggest Obsidian, Joplin, Trilium, etc. as I've tried them all. The only one I still want to try is Outline Wiki, but the setup is too complex just to set up for testing purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently purchased a refurbed Exos 16TB drive. I cleared the drive, ran stress tests on it, then threw it in my array. SMART data was fine etc.
 2 Days later, while trying to add another drive to my array, this drive starts throwing out errors every second. I reached out to the vendor who said they'd replace it no problem. Trouble is, the drive has highly sensitive data, and DBAN fails when trying to scrub. How comfortable would you be at that point sending the drive back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got my first rack and after some blunders got everything together. It's not obnoxiously loud most of the time, but its noticeable in the background. Got a Dell R620 with dual E5-2643 V2 chips. I read someone had mentioned Mass Loaded Vinyl as an option and I wanted to know if anyone had experience creating a "wall" out of one for the sides of the rack, and if that actually dampened the volume. I thought about using the insert holes on the sides of the rack to affix a panel to the side.
 ​
 Secondly, I grabbed a static rack kit from dell not quite realizing what static really implied, which wouldn't be a huge deal but when I attempted to remove the server, I can pull it out about 6 inches and then it almost seems to catch on something and won't come out further. Anyone experience that, is that normal? I pretty much have to remove the rails and make sure there is lots of clearance around the rack if I ever want to take it out all the way (and I'm dreading the thought).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all,
 A while back I got started using terraform to create/manage VMs on my proxmox homelab (thank you to those of you who have shared blog posts about this). 
 One thing that bothered me was how I was essentially copy/pasting the resource definitions when I wanted to create a new VM, so I recently went through a big refactor to reduce the amount of configuration required to create a new vm and wanted to share with this community in case others find it useful. With this setup I can now define a new VM with three lines of yaml, push my changes and have them deployed by the gitlab ci/cd pipeline. 
 https://github.com/nohbdy1745/proxmox-terraform 
 I have this deployed on a gitlab instance running in a proxmox VM, with gitlab managing my terraform state, and have the gitlab ci/cd pipeline setup so I can push changes to my terraform configuration and have them deployed from there. I set it up so that you don't need to have gitlab managed terraform state, you would just have to change the backend in main.tf and you can use the make commands to run everything. 
 Hope this is useful to someone else. I'm also not an expert with terraform so if you happen to take a look and have feedback please let me know!

 Basically I have a couple of external drives for cold storage that take up space and I want to chuck them into my case. I was going to shuck them but leave the USB to SATA logic board intact and route the USB and AC power cable through PCIe slot into the case. Unfortunately the logic board prevents the drives from being mounted properly in my Node 304 case (also, somehow my WD Reds and another Seagate drive only support 3 screw mounts? Did Fractal mess up?).

 selfhost/docker Beginner here. I already got some applications running, yay!
 But I´m currently stuck with hosting a mail/smtp application. I already tried the docker-mailserver, mailcow and as webinterfaces rainloop and sogo. But to be quite honest I am a little bit stunned by the complexity (a lot of services, ports,...) and amount of errors I am getting. I got not a single option to run correctly. I don´t know where to start.
 For me the topic selfhosted mail is the next logical step, because a lot of applications require an smtp server.
 So, had anyone a similar experience? Can someone recommend a proper, simple image or guide? What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I’ve been looking for a new analog transfer device for a while to transfer hi-8 and VHS tapes. I bought a cheap easy-cap like device, and it sucked. It was causing a lot of artifacting, frame drops, highlight blowout and just something I wouldn’t trust to transfer several hours worth of important footage.
 With Christmas around the corner, I’ve decided to treat myself with a good quality transfer device. Only problem is, I can’t find the right one. Most of the suggestions I’ve found online and on Reddit are extremely dated or way too advanced for my current setup.
 I’ve heard good things about the Hauppage HD PVR, elgato analog capture, and black magic intensity shuttle cards, but so many people have suggested different approaches that I don’t know which one to try. Everything from TBCs, scalers, passthroughs, to PCIs, I don’t even know if I’m getting the right thing.
 I want to get a good quality device that I can use with my laptop and camcorder without having to drop hundreds of bucks and uproot my entire setup. My main goal is to save these videos to a digital format while losing as little of the picture quality as possible. I’d greatly appreciate any suggestions for what I should invest in.

 I appreciate this isn't really a self hosted product, but if any sub on reddit knows the answer to my question, it's going to be you guys!
 I've managed to fumble my way through cloudflare zero tier to add GitHub as an identity provider, but how do I restrict which github accounts can access my tunnel - at the minute every account can log in. Is this even possible?
 Edit: Solution in the comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current homeserver is getting too small.
 I currently have a board that barely holds my GPU and ssd extension card. For future plans I need a mainboard that has more slots but I wonder if there is any workstation focused mainboard out there. Or are the gaming mainboards already the best to get when it comes to connectivity?
 ​
 The scenario:
 I have a server that runs Proxmox. I then have a bunch VMs/containers for my workload. All pretty basic except the gaming VM. I passthroguh my GPU, mouse and keyboard and connect to a screen.
 I might need more connectivity for that vm. E.g. to handle sound easily. I was thinking to buy a Thunderbolt extension card, also give that to the VM and then simply connect a docking station to it and be good. But for that I need at least one more card in the system... which does not fit currently.

To acquire new material, I need to be connected to a VPN. Is there a way to have my server on a VPN while leaving it accessible to the world outside my network? If not, is it possible to have a directory auto backup to the server, and would this be easier accomplished on windows or Linux?

I have a safe where I put HDDs with some accounting records and for that matter it has work for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a very basic server with Oracle Cloud free tier, and I managed to use Cloudflare and Nginx Proxy Manager to reroute my subdomains with the certifications and everything. However, the only way I get it to work is to expose each container port in my ingress rules on the Oracle server. 
 To my understanding (noob here), the idea of using Nginx is to be able just to expose the usual ports (80, 443) and let the rerouting to go behind that, without the need to expose rest of ther ports. Am I correct?
 I'm not sure what additional information I could give to help solve the issue, let me know if there is anything I can add.
 Thanks in advance for the support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Pretty much as per the title. Need a CRM to handle VERY simple tasks for software tech support. Basically need to be able to create some customers, associate them to incoming email addresses from our support address (simple SMTP/IMAP), create support items specific to them (usually stemming from said emails), assign to a team member, flag them as complete, etc, etc. Nothing too crazy, small 3-5 person team. Played with self-hosted Oodo but looks like way overkill and only one "app" for free version so that looks to end that scheme. PLayed with SuiteCRM but I seemed to be getting random errors, lag, etc (this was on a Windows install with XAMPP).
 Any thoughts, even if cloud based but free (if that exists) I suppose would work. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm going to try.
 I have a 14TB WD easystore that's been working for just over a year now. Yesterday, I noticed it was mounting and unmounting rapidly, so I ejected it and restarted the computer. 
 When I turned the computer back on it would no longer mount, the discs aren't spinning and there was a slow, white flashing from the LED indicator. I immediately looked up all the troubleshooting guides and did the following. 
  
Switched USB cables (used my other easystore's usb)
 plugged into a dedicated wall outlet
 checked windows device manager and un-checked "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" - restarted pc
 opened disc management, where it is not visible and there is no drive letter for it at all
 updated drivers 
 allowed hidden items in serial bus drivers
  
After frustration I stopped everything all together. This morning I plugged it in and there is still no disc spinning activity, and now the LED blinks rapidly. Is this thing bricked? I have 13.9 TBs on it and would really hate to lose it all. I had it propped up on fans and it was well maintained, and of course there is no power or reset button on these things.
 Any suggestions? It's still warrantied for another year. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have personal data (general, plus DSLR and GoPro photos/videos for Lightroom/Final Cut Pro), business data (including lots of big image files, say 1GB per file, 200GB currently), and my computer setup to back up. I don't generally save images/videos on my internal SSD.
 My current setup looks like this:
  
2TB external HD for photo/video storage 2.5"
 5TB external HD for business data storage 2.5"
 I also have a 2TB external SSD for temporary photo/video storage for faster editing. This only ever contains duplicates from the 2TB HD
 4TB external HD for backing up both the 2TB and the 5TB external HDs (yeah, the 4TB was here first, when I had 2x 2TB, but my business 2TB failed so I upgraded that to a 5TB... thus the stupid size relations)
 1TB time machine external HD for backing up my Mac setup/internal SSD
 iDrive Cloud for backing up my Time Machine, 2TB photo and 5TB business HD.
  
​
 Problem: My photo/video 2TB external HD is getting really full, only 10% space left... I started taking more videos, which take up a huge amount of space.
 Now I'm really torn as to how to smartly upgrade my backup setup.
  
Should I get a big external HD, maybe 6TB, to replace the current stupid 4TB backup HD, and use the 4TB backup HD for photos and videos instead?(I could even use the 4TB just for videos, leave my photos on the current 2TB photo/video HD). If so, should I get a 2.5" or 3.5" for the 6TB? I don't really need to move it, it should stay on my desk, but is there still an advantage to 3.5" these days at all?
 Or should I rather get a second smallish (2TB) external HD to put the videos on, so that the current photo/video HD only contains photos, and leave the backup 4TB as is for now?
  
​
 Trying to save money atm, but also want a sustainable solution...
 Which option do you suggest and why?
 Feel free to also add other sensible options that I'm missing here!
 ​
 Thanks so much!

 Does anyone know if there are any programs like stash that i can use to acess my downloaded youtube videos from my web browser on my lan in an aesthetically pleasing way?
 I do not want to use plex as while i have that setup and it is good on the tv i would love something a bit more browser focussed for accessing in web browsers on my computers to go along with stash, calibre, kiwix, sonarr, radarr etc.

 I installed both Proxmox and Ubuntu without any problem, but when I try to boot I just can't.
 I disabled secure boot from the BIOS settings and enabled Legacy mode, I downgraded BIOS firmware, but nothing worked.
 The computer previously had a 1TB hard disk, I installed Ubuntu on it and it won't boot either.
 Before I formatted the hard disk had Windows on it and it worked. My thoughts are that maybe the computer has some Linux block, so it can't boot Linux.
 Is there someone who maybe had the same issue and can help me?
 Thanks!

 TLDR: What do you use for your home NAS (OS or Appliance)? Do you have a separate computer/server to run apps and use your NAS for storage?
 A few months ago, I switched from OMV to TrueNAS SCALE. I wanted stability and ease of use for my NAS because my family also relies on my NAS. I found OMV to be buggy, and not intuitive. In my opinion, I could not trust OMV. Now I am considering going back to OMV.
 TrueNAS SCALE has been great for me, at least if I used the very basic features of having a ZFS pool with a few SMB/NFS shares, but I wanted to run apps as well, such as Plex, Nextcloud, etc..., but that has been the biggest hassle for me, and I miss being able to use Docker Compose and apps just working.
 I added TrueCharts to my NAS to get all the apps I would want to run but li…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if anyone here archives games, or has experience with Minecraft, but is there any way to have a Minecraft launcher, such as the titan launcher, for offline use? What I mean is, if you use the titan launcher you still have to download any version you might want to play. What I'm looking for is a launcher that already has ALL Minecraft versions built in so I can just play it wherever and whenever and require no internet connection whatsoever. I want this for purposes of archiving the game on an external HDD, since I'm a big data hoarder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to take some time and rave about Frigate NVR. I just installed it a couple days ago on home assistant and wow. For my personal use, It blows Agent DVR (Which I had been using for several months) out of the water. Here are some of my favorite points:
  
Accuracy is phenomenal for AI detections. This was always an issue with Agent DVR for me. It would detect my oil tank and christmas lights as people with up to 80% confidence level. Even sunset shadows it would be up to 70% confident it was people. By the time I masked these out almost 1/2 of the screen was gone. Zero false positives so far with Frigate and no masks.
 Clips are so smooth.
 CPU (Not using Coral) usage is extremely low and getting 15 to 19ms inference times on Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 (Running HAOS Arm64 as a Hyper-V VM on Windows Dev Kit 2023). This is something I could not have said when I was running Agent DVR. AI detection with CodeProject.AI was usually hitting 40-60% CPU utilization on a 12 core i5 1240p. Agent DVR always idled at around 12% CPU utilization.

I watched Cooptonioan's video but that only covers disabling MFA for the local network whereas my goal would be to trust anyone that connects from the local network (thus disabling authentication) which is absolutely needed for the wife acceptance factor. How can this be achieved?
 PS setup was done based on GeeksCircuit guide.

 I have a few os options, originally i was going to install proxmox ve, truenas, home assistant, ubuntu for docker containers, windows ect. I would like to just run windows server as a host os because if there is an issue in windows there is a much higher chance of me being able to fix it on my own without hours of googleing. I would like to have a standard smb share for my files, raid 10 6 hdd probably, but i would also like some sort of web interface that i can upload or download files from if i can't use smb for whatever reason. I have been told by people that storage spaces in windows is a nightmare though.
 Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the opportunity to buy around 50 500GB HDDs still sealed in their original packaging (about USD 4.50 per drive), and was wondering if it would be worth getting any. 
 Based on this thread, it seems that the best use would be to just (re)sell the drives or offer upgrade services; and that building something with them would be quite inefficient due to high power requirements relative to the storage space available. Any other ideas on what else could be done with these drives? Or would those two suggestions still be the best advice today? 
 Also, these drives are somewhat old (manufactured 2015, ~7 years ago). If the HDDs have been factory sealed all this time, would they still be very likely to work, or would there be some form of degradation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am selfhosting a lot of services like plex, nextcloud, adguard, ... and I would like to have good perf for R/W for the services.
 Specs: - I have multiple proxmox host for HA (like Dell optiplex) - I use the ZFS features (so this storage will be on ZFS). - Storage should be on 10Gb 
 I think all the virtual disks would be on this new storage but there is a problem because I need : - SSD (good perf) for virtual disks of VMs - HDD for data (like movies, doc, pic, ...)
 --> So I think I would go with 2 zfs pools
 My questions are : - Which bay storage (with ECC Ram) should I use for my case ? SAN, NAS, DAS ? - What's the size of your pool and what kind of disk? - Where are your virtual disk, host side or dedicated storage reachable via NFS ? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an app to real-time receive and plot sensor data (through TCP, sent by MCU with wifi) and save them for future analyzing. Like a PC oscilloscope.
 The features I need are: 1. Real-time receive and plotting 2. Data source can be TCP socket or named pipe (whatever as long as I can write a python script to be a middle converter) 3. Allow me to select a x-axis range to save a part of received data
 I've tried: - PulseView (can't real-time continuously receive) - LabPlot (KDE) (can't select a part of received data to save. And easy to crash) - Audacity (which is a sound wave editing software. Good for range selecting, but, can't set real-time data source to be other than mic. And can't show the wave if Y value larger than 1)
 Thank you guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been poking around trying to find a solution for archiving threads from various automotive forums. For anyone who doesn't use these forums, they have been dying over the years as people move to other social media platforms and with the decline in usage comes a decline in maintenance. Sometimes all the images disappear, videos get removed, or whole forum domains go down. Most of what's on these forums isn't super useful but there's a handful of threads showing highly custom stuff that is relevant to my own projects.
 I would like to be able to archive a thread in its entirety for later reference to include images, videos, and other links. I played around with ArchiveBox some and archiving with a link depth of 1 seems to gather all that, but also grabs all the other irrelevant links that are on a forum page that I don't care for. I also can only archive a thread one page at a time using ArchiveBox, which doesn't work for threads that might go on for hundreds of pages.
 I did some research and I think what I am looking for is a web scraper tool that can snag all the thread posts and associated links on a page, then cycle to the next page in the thread and repeat until all the pages have been archived....so with all that being said I am looking for recommendations for tools that might fit this use case.
 Since I don't think there's much overlap between self hosters and people who frequent the forums (though I might be wrong) here are two links of example threads that I would love to make sure I have indefinite access to (so long as I maintain my homelab).
  
Example 1
 Example 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if anybody else is having this problem: I'm one of the hosts of mintCast, I also manage the mintCast.org web server on a raspberry pi in my basement. In addition to that I host a Nextcloud instance that we use for our infrastructure. Though I've got Nextcloud running on bare metal, I've got the collabora server running in a docker container on the same machine. All of this is sitting behind and Nginx reverse proxy manager which itself is running in a docker container. The problem I'm having is when I try to embed calendars from next cloud onto the WordPress site I get an error on next cloud saying it cannot copy the HTML code to the clipboard. All of the SSL is sorted. Everything behind the reverse proxy has a self-signed certificate which the proxy trusts and then Nginx handles the external stuff with let's encrypt. I've also noted that I cannot copy and paste directly onto next cloud office documents. At least not with the mouse I have to use control v etc. I'm wondering if there's something I need to pass to the reverse proxy to give stuff like next cloud behind the rivers proxy access to the clipboard. If anybody knows anything about this I would greatly appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping my fellow homelab community can weigh in on this. I run a few websites that send email (~1-5k per month) and have a bunch of homelab stuff on different domains that sends transactional emails (~500 per month).
 I have been using Mailgun for the last few years and whilst good, I have started having to pay each month as the amount of emails sent goes over the free tier. This has at most been around $6-$10 in a single month. I have been tying with the thought of switching over to amazon SES as its ridiculously cheaper. I then happened to stumble on the delights of Postal (postalserver.io).
 I am now stuck toying with the idea of SES or do I host my own Postal on a VPS somewhere? I send emails from roughly 20 different domains and would like to utilise security features where possible. I understand the issues with IP reputation that comes from email delivery.
 Am i better off just sticking with SES? Overall it will probably be cheaper. Or do I go Postal with slightly more VPS monthly cost but with the freedom and much better UI / dashboards?
 ​
 OR even better can I host Postal on AWS and get postal to send via SES and utilise the 62k free emails per month (i assume this either wont work or will require each domain to be verified in SES anyway?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. I am very sure that my self-hosted AdGuard Home container is causing problems for me.
 I am currently often playing Modern Warfare 2 in the evening / night and I am playing and the Steam connection is randomly lost. First I thought of the Steam servers of course but I'm the only one with problems. It happens every day or at least every second day. And then the connection is lost and won't reconnect for at least 5 minutes I guess. Then it often works again.
 I tried to change the DNS server in the settings of my ethernet adapter on Windows 11 (to 8.8.8.8 e.g. instead of the local server) where I have my server 192.168.178.xx and as second 1.1.1.1 and flushed the DNS and it instantly worked again. So it seems to be that it has something to do with my DNS by AdGuard Home. But how the hell I am I supposed to really validate it or better fix it?
 The internet stays online while this disconnect in Steam is happening. Everything keeps working. Only Steam is not.
 Does anybody have an idea? I am pretty sure its caused by the DNS...

 I've just tried them back-to-back with some 10g server ports ( for link/ping tests ) and that doesn't seem to function either. Does anyone have these running with copper interface SFP+ modules? Do you have a part number if so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've recently gotten my hands on an HP DL380 G6 that I cannot for the life of me get to post. No matter what I've tried I cannot get any video output, not even as much as seeing the HP splash screen. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 I can't reach iLO by domain name, and does not show up in device list on my router so I cannot find an IP address (server may not even have a valid license).
 Last owner of the server was able to reach the BIOS, and did not make any configuration changes before I got it.
 Front panel indicators:
  
Server health indicator: solid green
 Server power indicator: solid green
 DIMMs: off
 Power supplies: off
 Processors: Solid amber
 Hard drive lights: come on for a split second and turn off almost immediately
 Fans: off
 Over temp: off
 Power cap: off
  
Fixes I've tried are as follows: 
  
Resocketing CPUs, along with running each CPU individually
 Running minimum amount of DIMMs
 Using only 1 power supply
 Resocketing the power supplies
 Swapping the power supplies
 Changing VGA port used 
 Did not try a different cable as I know for a fact the one I was using works
 
 Changing to a different monitor
 Flipping DIP switch 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping it off (turning server off and removing power supplies before flipping it each time obv)
 Flipping DIP switch 1, 5, 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping them off
 Simply letting it sit for an hour or so to see if it was just taking an absurd amount of time to boot
  
If any more information is needed I'll happily provide it, and once again thank you for your help.

I've got a dedicated HP-109a with VMs and about 30 dockers. and I've had an HP microserver N40L running for over 10 years, most of it running on unRAID. It's got about 7 disks in It. Some 4TB, 3TB, 2TB etc.. About 15TB in total. N40L is getting a bit old now.. it for the most part shares out large media files over jellyfin. 
 Was thinking of just getting 1 x 20TB disk in the HP-109a and having that as my NAS and container server & VMs.. it should handle the load OK.. i Can keep the N40L as an offline backup... I can live with loosing a week or so of data without parity. Don't think I need the RAID performance.. any other considerations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've created a dual-boot PC for myself so I can learn how to use Linux and hopefully transition away from Windows. 
 I want to have my PC automatically backup all its data. However, there are a lot of different ways to backup PCs, and I'm not sure which methods/programs would work best for my situation. 
 I've looked through the r/DataHoarder Wiki and I have a rough idea of what a backed-up PC should look like, but my problem is that there are a lot of backup tools and programs out there and I don't know which I should use. "I'm trapped by overchoice." 
 I also can't seem to find any guides on what can and can't be done when trying to backup a dual-boot PC. Can one operating system backup both itself and the other operating system, or do both operating systems need to have their own backups? 
 As to my current situation. I have about 1TB of personal data (I save a lot of movies, music, and images). I currently have all my data saved on a 2TB external USB HDD. My dual-boot PC is set up, but I haven't installed anything on it yet because I want to make sure I have a backup system all set up first. I have a bit of a "hodgepodge" of drives. I have:
  
Two 500GB SSDs as my boot drives for Linux and Windows respectfully
 One 500GB HDD I salvaged from my mom's old desktop.
 One 750GB HDD I salvaged from my old Toshiba laptop
 One 2TB HDD that serves as my PC's internal "bulk storage" drive for all the music, videos, and images. 
 One external USB 2TB HDD that I've been using as my backup drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at Restic, BackupPC and Borg right now and trying to figure out if either of them support pre- and post-commands.
 The reason is that I would like to run a few exporters first, like so:
 ``` sysupgrade -b $outname.tar.gz # Also supports printing to STDOUT, but its always .tar.gz mysqldump ... # To dump all tables, users, ...
 ... others ...
 rsync serve $type wasabi-crypt:/backups ```
 After that, I might want to run cleanup commands.
 I will be running this on: - GNU/Linux, Debian 11 - linux, OpenWrt
 As for my windows maschines, it's quite straight forward: just a directory list and possibly LudoSavi... but thats a worry for another day. First, I need to get my cruicial infrastructure (router, servers) backed up.
 As for the backend: I am using Wasabi with an encryption setup - I want to use it as my off-site backup, purely. Hence rclone mount .... I did see Restic can do that on it's own (making me believe it might just consume the RClone API) but I am not sure if Borg can.
 In the end, I am also not sure if I want to use multiple repositories or not; probably depends on the program.
 Would love if you could give me some input on this! Thanks so much :)

 Following a a power...blip? the other day, StableBit Scanner is reporting a handful of them with unreadable sectors.
 Every single drive where damage was reported is in a single QNAP enclosure.
 Number of sectors unreadable on all affected drives: 1, 1, 1, 8, 61, 44240
 Only two media files were affected (99%+ intact) and were recovered via Scanner. The "most damaged" drive amounted to 21MiB in terms of storage.
 Scanner reports all drives as otherwise healthy, and no SMART flags to check
 I manually confirmed that all affected drives are reporting 0 for Reallocated Sectors, Reallocation Events, Pending Sectors, Uncorrectable Sectors (I guess that last one doesn't make sense to me)
 My two questions are:
 Should I treat this as "the beginning of the end" for these drives, or not?
 Would a UPS have probably avoided this event?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got my storage start on HardForums storage showoff threads in around 2008 and I miss that format quite a lot so I think it's about time we recreate it here. The basic idea is to post pictures of your setup, detail the spec and tell us what you use your storage for.
 Here's an example post format...
  
 Amount of total storage (Raw/Formatted/Config)
 Case
 PSU
 CPU
 RAM
 Motherboard
 Controller Cards (if any)
 Drives (include full model numbers)
 Operating System
 A paragraph or two describing what you use your storage for and how you handle backups and organizing and maybe future upgrade plans.
 Gallery of images (use imgur gallery format not separate image links)
  
 We will run this thread every 6 months or so and update the post to feature the most upvoted, discussed and interesting systems! Have fun!! 
 P.S. Some of you may remember where I was when I first joined DH, from this thread and it's about time I post a new one so I'll join you in posting my current setup should this go well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would rather self -host on my own computer. So from my understanding i need two things
  
Back-end service (the one that has vikunja-unstable-windows-4.0-386.exe in the folder)
 Front-end service such as the desktop client
  
Standard ports are already taken by XAMPP and i haven't configured "config.yml.sample" BUT for the sake of testing I don't have xampp running.
 I tried running it out of the box but the last line of code is:
 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8258504-05:00: INFO ▶ [EVENTS] 093 Starting handler, subscriber_name=namespace.created.namespace.counter.increase, topic=namespace.created 
 Meanwhile it says at the first lines
 2022/12/14 16:38:02 No config file found, using default or config from environment variables. 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8222434-05:00: INFO ▶ migration/Migrate 04e Ran all migrations successfully. 
 I'm pretty sure to configure the yaml file i need to remove .sample but it should work out of the box without configuring it right? Mind you during this test i'm not running any server on localhost.
 I run the client and the prompt says
 An error occurred: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL Please check if the api url is correct. 
 After inserting the default port in the address:
 Could not find or use Vikunja installation at "localhost". Please try a different url. 
 What do i do now?

File permissions have been ridiculously annoying while on linux and I wanted to change to ext4. I have had success in some ways with hfsplus mounting but I can not share the drives or do anything I really want lol.
 Does the Probox work as ext4 or zfs? I did not want to do NTFS but...I would prefer it to HFS+ at this point. 
 If yes to ext4 and/or NTFS: If I format one drive at a time, would that work? Or would I lose/corrupt data on the other 2 drives? I am asking because I was hoping to copy as much data to 2 of the drives, wipe, then transfer data back. Do this for all 3
 Do I manually remove the drive from the enclosure or can I format a drive, one at a (I have no idea how raid really works or if this is actually a raid setup). 
 Thank you guys!

This program looked like an ideal file sync program for me. However, I discovered that one of my favorite YouTubers made a nice tutorial about file syncing using a program known as "Resilio". I don't know which of these two programs to pick, so I was wondering if anyone here has used Resilio and could give a review of the program, and maybe talk about how it compares to other file sync programs.

Rack mount
 Super quiet, upgrades or swapping out for consumer / quiet is fine, but it must be quiet 
 The SuperMicro SQ PSU is not that quiet, I have that also, its still loud, but quieter than a jet turbine hahaa
 
 Maximum bays count
 Good build quality, I don't want cheap chassis to kill me with slow death of annoyance and failure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I tried posting on r/buildapc and it didn't get any responses. I've moved recently, and I'm on a new build estate which seems to be suffering with brown outs a few times a week. I've been told this will stop next year as the other side of the estate is connected, however it's worrying me a little as my NAS, PC and Mac mini have all been unexpectedly shutdown a few times. I'd like to attach:
  
Synology DS1817+ (5-60W)
 PC (750wPSU) (70-500W)
 Mac Mini (2-80W)
 Network gear (50-100W complete guess as I've not attached the meter yet)
  
I'm not much of a gamer, so the PC is very rarely pulling 500W+, it tends to idle at 70W and normal use may take it to 150W. I've been looking at a few of the calculators and for 3 minutes runtime something rated around the 1500VA/900W seems to be recommended. I've got no experience with UPSs at home, we use Eaton at work, but I've never had much to do with their configs. I think I can budget around £300, but I could stretch that a little. I've got some rack gear, so I'm open to either rack or freestanding units. These models seem to come up, or their rack equivalent:
  
CyberPower CP1500EPFCLCD
 Powercool Smart UPS 2000VA
 APC BX1600MI
 Eaton 5P850i
  
I'd be grateful for any feedback, recommendations and I can provide any other info if it helps. I'm slightly confused by the price differences for similar headline specs, I'm not sure if this is just a brand thing or some feature I should be focussing on. Any recommendation for the software setup, mainly for the Mac and NAS as they are always on. 
 Thanks in advance :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a while and I'm a bit confused. As many others, my lab is composed of (close to) free stuff I gathered for years, I'd rather make things work with what I have.
 I recently upgraded my simple network (fritzbox + fritzrepeater, main network + guest access) to a more complex setup: fritzbox (as a vdsl modem), apu4c board running opnsense, Netgear GS324T managed switch, fritz repeater as an AP.
 As you can see, the fritzbox and the repeater are now far apart thus the mesh feature stopped working and with it the guest access, that's to be expected. What I don't understand is the following: for the guest access to work between the fritzbox and the repeater, there has to be some vlan shenningans, I doubt AVM invented a brand new mechanism to separate traffic. My guess was that somehow all fritzbox ports were trunked with the default vlan being for the main network and all traffic from guest access was tagged with a vlan id.
 I tried setting it up like that, but I couldn't identify the vlan id (tried a bunch but that's tedious and I'm unsure how to inspect traffic at the switch, never done port mirroring before, not sure how to use linux to listen to it).
 Anyway, my question is, does anyone know if AVM could be using some other technology? Is there another way to use a fritz repeater to have two separate networks?

 I'm wondering what "poster" is. Is it the front cover of the DVD case? like this https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/e8EAAMXQAx9RN3Lq/s-l500.jpg ? I'm asking because Kodi doesn't use "cover.jpg."
 Also do you prefer the naming scheme above or you just use "cover.jpg", like so:
 + Name of Movie (YEAR) - Name of Movie (YEAR).mp4 - cover.jpg

 What's the best drive I can find regarding power consumption + silent and preferably 5400 RPM for 12TB+?
 Thanks!

Wanted something small that could be tucked away in a corner but have enough to run the few VM's I use and came across this (MINIS FORUM U820). Not supper powerful, but out of the box, this thing is quick. I kept the 512 M.2 drive it came with for holding ISO's and so on and added in 2 1TB SSD's and upgraded the RAM to 32GB. The only issue I have so far is vanilla ESXi 7 will not see either NIC, but vanilla ESXi 8 will see the 2.5GB port (which is what I needed). I am sure if I played around with it, I could get the 1GB port working. Just thought I would pass this along for anyone looking at something small.

 What do you do? Generic host names? Numbering? Software names? Anything creative? Do you follow a theme like greek letters/zodiacs/whatever?
 router dot domain is not that creative, neither is media dot domain. I saw someone using planets or stars but I guess that could become messy and not that obvious when debugging stuff not touched for a long time

 I'm living in europe and I've noticed that electricity prices in my area (Germany) have been exponentially increasing, thanks to Putin... (0,23€/kWh to 0,44€/kWh)
 I'm looking for ways to reduce my energy consumption and cut down on costs, and I'm wondering what measures other European homelabbers have taken to combat rising electricity prices.
 Currently i setup my Fujitsu Primergy RX600 S6 to only run from 9AM to 1AM so i can at lease save a third of the costs, by running it 16 hours a day im actually awake instead of 24/7. Also i configured power savings mode in iRMC. It is still running at 170 Watts.
 Any further advice, hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to fix the "status" indicator for non -arr apps added to Homarr?
 I don't use -arr services right now, but I like Homarr as my dashboard. Unfortunately, the little "online" indicators all show as offline, except for Dash. (dashdot). I know the services are online, but not sure how to fix this.
 I can remove these indicators by toggling the option within the advanced options tab, but it'd be nice to have a quick visual status indicator.
 Any ideas?
 First picture shows NPM as offline, but pings show otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone built a homelab storage solution that achieves: 
  
large sized volumes, say 30TB or larger (so simply using expensive SSD arrays isn’t an option)
 high IOPS, say 5-10k (so a simple mechanical array isn’t an option)
 utilizing 2.5GbE network capacity 
  
Or, if you wanted to build a NAS solution with about 30TB of working data, with lots of small I/O, and fully utilizing a 2.5GbE network, what would you build?
 Synology SSD read-write cache is insufficient, Intel CAS is commercial and is designed for Optane primarily I think, Intel SRT is discontinued, storage spaces with an SSD tier might be an option but they really want you to use an expensive Windows Server install and spaces seems to be unwieldy, Linux bcache might be an option, ZFS or Unraid with an SSD cache might be an option…

The 730xd has more drive space than I know what to do with, no optical bay, but has those fancy rear flex bays.
 I'm wondering if I can take a r730xd and swap the front section for the 8x3.5" from the r730. This way I can have my OS mirror, optical drive, and not feel bad for using 1/3 of the drive space. I don't see anything online about it though, and wanted to check here before I sacrifice my dvd drive.

 I built a new NAS a couple of months ago with a i3-10100 CPU @ 3.60GHz (Gigabyte B560M) and a number of WD Red HDDs based on TrueNAS Scale. It's fast and quiet, and really does everything that I could need it for.
 However, I also have a Synology DS920+ on the way from a friend who got a newer 923 from his work. He's only had the 920 for about 6 months. Knowing what I know about Syno, it'll also do the trick.
 My question is this: which one will last longer? Which is a better value proposition for things like Plex, the 'arr suite, and simple Time Machine/cold storage?
 I'm a little worried that what is essentially a gaming motherboard is going to wear out at a certain point, but I'm calling on all of your years experience: go with the DIY solution for the long run, or trust in the Syno, which I've seen people running for 8 years or so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I purchased a SFP module from FS - GPON-ONU-34-20BI. And after ~1h port management and many other functions on UDM SE just stop working. Restart solves it but restarting a router every hour is extremely stupid. Ubiquiti support literally said to me that they don’t care because it isn’t their module. But the problem is that I can’t use theirs module because I need to change GPON SN and VendorID to get internet connection from my ISP. Do you have any SFP modules with changeable SN and VendorID to recommend? Of course it needs to work with UDM SE.
 TLDR: recommend any module that meets requirements in the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked this in /r/webdev and they suggested you folks could help me more:
 I have a niche website that currently has about a dozen TB of storage. As the website has started to grow, the data has started to become an issue....the hard drive I use to hold the files is no longer going to be able to hold it all. I'm estimating the storage will be 25-50TB, with about 50-100GB in daily bandwidth, at a minimum. So I need solutions with unlimited traffic.
 I am cheap, so using cloud providers like Azure, AWS is not really an option. I have noticed that Hetzner has cheap servers, with large hard drives (and empty slots for future growth). The issue I now see is the practical question of...how do I merge the hard drives while maintaining some level of protection against disk failure? If I have 3 HD…]]></summary>

 I don't have a ZFS server, but plan to build a modest one sometime in the future - so should I grab some Optane modules now before they are gone for good?
 Background: Optane solid state memory is great for write caching because unlike standard SSD storage it really won't wear out in any reasonable amount of time.

 So bit the bullet and today got a ZTE MC8020 5G CPE Router. It's arguably the best 5G router on the market (before ZTEs 6Ghz one drops in a few weeks). Without any tweaking I can get 300/50mbps solid with pings as low as 8ms. On my home fiber I was never offered anything better than 50/5mbps for the same price...
  
My question is how to I properly set up both the devices so they work together?
 I have every ethernet port of the AX88U populated. TV, PS5, 2x Gig Homelab, NV Shield, PC, etc. Previously I just connected the WAN port on the AX88U into the wall ethernet socket.

 Every now and again (4 times today) the internet will drop completely and will stay down until I reboot the ISP router. 
 I know it’s the ISP router as I plug an Ethernet cable directly into it, and there’s no internet. 
 Frustratingly, this seems to be happening more and more frequently, and the ISP can’t send an engineer until next week, so I’m looking to see if there’s anything anybody can suggest. 
 What’s even more odd is when I’m experiencing the issue the IP I get when plugging into the ISP router is not my WAN IP. When the issue isn’t happening, it is. 
 So the issue seems to be down to the ISP router doing something weird/wrong. 
 It’s driving me fucking crazy and I can’t handle another week before the engineer comes. The last three times I’ve rebooted, the connection has lasted for about 10-20 minutes and then it goes down again. Same issue as I’ve described above. 
 Anybody have any fucking idea?!

 I recently asked about downloading iCloud photos - You can find my post here.
 As I am now using gimme-iphoto for regularly downloading all of my photos, I found that there's certain metadata missing from certain files... What I found missing:
  
Any geolocation data - missing from any photo or video
 Date taken - missing from any screenshot or imported picture
  
I have also tried using a Mac and exporting the photos (by hand), but this information is also missing, whereas if I look at the photos' info boxes, even screenshots have dates attached to them.
 Is there any solution to download / export the files with this missing data?

 ​
 I've been testing some stuff with the new 10gb network, and I seem to have hit a strange issue. On Windows 10, running iperf to a TrueNAS box with 2 10Gb ports bondeed together, I am getting 6Gb/s on a single thread, which I don't think is too bad.
 ​
 But when I run multiple tests over time, it eventually drops to 2.4 ish....I thought maybe the NIC was overheating, but I ziptied a fan to it and it still seems to be having trouble. The drivers for this card were absolute dogshit to setup, and I'm to the point I"m probably going to grab an intel 10gb nic instead....
 ​
 Does anyone else have experience with 10gb that could tell me maybe why I'm getting this weirdly sudden and consistent drop in speed? I'm using an HPNC523SFP on both sides of the connection, with a Mikrotik CRS317 running SWOS in the middle here. The NAS Server is running Proxmox with the 2 ports bonded in lacp mode passed to a bridge that a TrueNAS VM is using. The ports are set both in active mode on the switch, and the client is just a plain ass Windows 10 box.
 ​
 I can't think of anything else significant I have configured here...

(This is a FQDN.) I have seen the docs and followed the various tips including adjusting APP_URL, APP_ENV and APP_FORCE_URL. Whenever I switch APP_URL to https, the site becomes inaccessible with an SSL error.
 Here are the configs: https://pastebin.com/Qccwu1LN
 As an aside, I poked around the Apache configs in the Docker container and was curious to see that there is no SSL conf in sites-enabled. There is a config in sites-available, but I think that the path to the SSL certs is wrong. Could this be causing the issue?
 It feels like, "it just works" for most people here, but for whatever reason, I have had nothing but problems configuring SSL. (HTTP works fine.)

 Mount each raspberry pi onto eachother via an rclone sftp mount.
 on each raspi settup jellyfin to read from the remote raspi drives and their own local drive.
 Now each raspberry pi is connected to eachother and each person with a raspberry pi can play media from it.
 But now let’s say I would want to add a 4th raspi remotely. Since each person lives separately what would be a good way to make it to auto-connect a 4th raspi?

 I found recently the Flame dashboard and really liked the look. I had no experience in customizing such things, but found out how to do it myself and am happy to share. Hopefully it will be helpful for someone out there! :)
 I know it's not a big deal, however, I am still happy about this achievement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering if anyone else is using this method. I just got my Pixel 1 in from ebay.
 I plan to keep and host all family videos / photos on my server, and have backups on and off site of that server. 
 Planning on using something like syncthing to get pics from our phones to the pixel, and then from the pixel to our "family" google account.
 Questions:
  
What is the best way to get pictures from our phones (android and iphone) to my server? Syncthing? Some other app im not thinking of?
 
Is it really unlimited full res for the life of the phone? I used the "reduced quality" for a long time and was never disappointed with the quality of the pictures saved - should I just use that to not piss google off?
 
Any other tips to get this to work flawlessly? (auto delete from phone after it uploads to google, etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got one of those BF deals for a big external HDD. Inside the outer Amazon box was the inner manufacturer box, but that was actually loose inside of the outer box. HDD itself seemed well packed / protected inside of the Manufacturer box though. 
 I documented the way it arrived and ran the an extended SMART driver test using the Manufacturer's utility. Took a couple of days due to size of the drive, but passed with no issues. Ran a few short tests with the same results. 
 So my question for my fellow Datahorders is what would you do? Return the drive and hope replacement is packed better or be satisfied with inner box protection + testing? Just curious.

 I tried going to the dashboard and doing Quick Sync, but it uses ./galleries/ which I can't find on my piwigo instance using the shell and when I try to add /gallery as a site it says the directory doesn't exist.
 If there's any other better way to sync my gallery with piwigo I would love to hear it, I'm using Android.
 I did try to use photoprism and lychee too but they didn't play well with syncthing and I didn't find any free ways to sync my gallery with either of them
 ​
 This is my docker compose for both syncthing and piwigo
 Edit: I checked with the entire file system and just had to route the shared folder of syncthing and piwigo to /gallery/galleries in the piwigo instance

 I have a music library that measures 59.7gb on my windows 10 laptop SSD. When I have transferred my library to my android phone it suddenly measures 63.97gb (when viewed via the phone's file explorer) and 59.8gb (when the phone is connected by usb and viewed via windows file explorer).
 ​
 Is this normal? Is it just due to differences in the filesystem or formatting or something? I tried searching around a little but I'm struggling to find a solid answer on this and would appreciate some assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all.
 ​
 I have a NAS in a SilverStone DS380 (8-hotswap bay) along with some external USB 3.0 disk enclosures, making a total of 12x10TB but the pool is starting to get full and I am thinking of adding 4x20TB in short-term (Q1 2023) getting to 12x20TB in the mid-term (Q4 2024).
 ​
 SilverStone DS380 8-bay
 I do not have space for jumping to a rack solution (which is always on my mind and I will do for sure once i move home) so I need to stick in the meantime with tower-based NAS/DAS solutions. The ideal case would be the 12-bay Synology model of the pic, with the possibility to daisy-chain another 12-bay model to it, but I cannot ID it or find a non-rack alternative.
 ​
 ​
 Synology DS 12-bay
 ​
 Basically, I am trying to find a tower-size 8-bay (minimum) to 12-bay (preferable) DAS (no need to be hot-swap) with USB connection to attach it to my DS380 NAS until I move to a real rack solution (early 2025). 
 ​
 I have found some solutions from Orico, Mediasonic, Fantec, OWC, Sabrent... but I read a lot of connectionand cooling issues from this solutions I need to avoid as my system is on 24/7 as a backup and media server to 4 users. Plus I find them too overpriced for just a steel case with trayless bays ($50?), 150w low-efficiency PSU ($30?) and a bunch of SATA to USB adapters ($15?).
 ​
 ​
 Mediasonic 8-bay
 ​
 The best option I manage is another DS380 as a JBOD DAS, with a 300W gold SFX PSU, a pair of SSF-8088 connectors and SFF-8087 cables, but I would need to adress the dual-PSU synchronism with a Supermicro JBOD power control board for example and I would need to buy a JBOD card on my main system with external SSF-8088 connectors.
 ​
 Any thoughts on this? I live in Europe so the available solutions may be reduced.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Reddit! (Sorry for my english)
 I'm looking for a simple self-hosted Forms Builder with a really important feature. It should have an option to prefill some fields using attributes from URL
 I have an example - https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 So if i'll use link http://myip:5200/form/gdR6dx?field1=text1 I'll get prefilled field "field1" with "text1"
 I guess you've got the idea. But this APP is buggy and is not really supported how I can see. So I'm looking for another one with same feature
 Also https://forms.yandex.com/ provide the same feature, but it's not a self-hosted app
 https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/forms/pre-fill
 I checked a few posts with same topic but didn't find exactly what I'm looking for
 Apps which I already tried:
 https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 https://github.com/Budibase
 https://github.com/formio/formio
 Thanks for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 I'm working on a open source self-hosted dashboard that has the following core functionalities: hardware monitoring and file storage/management. My goal is to make it as minimalistic and user friendly as possible. The current name I have in mind is X-Panel. I'm looking for suggestions for a good name and some more features for this web app. I want a name that is easy to remember and accurately reflects the functionality of the web app. Any suggestions or ideas for improving the current name or coming up with a new one would be greatly appreciated! I have also added some screenshots of the web interface.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I am trying to find a solution to store all the family photos on a VPS. I'd like to have end-to-end and server side encryption. Seafile seems ideal, but heard some critique regarding the way files are stored and issues that could happen if something happens to the database. 
 We all use Apple devices, so syncthing is not so good either as their iOS app is really awful. 
 Nextcloud feels very sluggish and OwnCloud Infinite Scale is very young with not lots of documentation (not even sure it has server side encryption).
 Any recommendations on that matter? Thanks!
