 What is HomelabAPI?
 HomelabAPI is a self-hosted API that you can use to consolidate all of your homelab notifications and other outputs. This allows you to use HomelabAPI as your central input/output hub, and if you ever want to change where your homelab outputs go, it's just a matter of updating your HomelabAPI configuration.

I have seen the ICON USB Ravens (at $1200 each - Nope) and Optical Displayport cables. Was wondering if anyone has seen a device that runs over Fiber with Single in/Single out 'KVM' for remote workstations.
 Full Story:
 My 16 yo and 12 yo each have decent gaming rigs in their shared bedroom (R5 5600x's, RX6800's, Samsung G5 32in 1440P curved displays and secondary 24in 108P portrait displays for each). Been monitoring Home Assistant and even shut off the damper for HVAC going to their room and it gets HOT in there. Ecobee remote sensor shows 78-80 with the ceiling fan on and door open over Christmas break (again with no HVAC input). The rest of the rooms with sensors show 69-71 with the Ecobee set to 70. In NE Ohio so during the winter I guess its manageable but in the summer its near unbearable.
 What I would like to do is move their towers both down to my 'Server Room' (converted fruit cellar in the basement) with my rack and core infrastructure. House is wired with 6A in the walls but I did put conduit in with pull strings to the attic so pulling OM4 to their workstations isn't out of reach. Also since these are gaming rigs and not productivity workstations, would like to keep high refresh rate and low latency. (One can dream - right?)
 Thin clients may work with something light weight - but would rather local connection and not have to go out of the internal net (Looking at you Parsec).
 I'm guessing most of us manage gear over IMPI/SSH/Web interfaces but figured someone somewhere may have rack mounted their PC and is doing something similar to what I am trying to do.
 Thanks for any and all suggestions!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy HomeLabbers!
 I received a Dell R730XD with the H730P RAID controller today. I want to run ProxMox and then a bunch of stuff on top (TrueNAS, VMs, etc, etc)
 When I received it it was configured with 2 virtual disks (boot = 6TB, storage = 60TB)
 I have installed ProxMox on the boot "array", however I cannot see the "storage" array. In my research I have found that apparently ProxMox and other systems do not like hardware RAID controllers. 
 Any suggestions on the path forward? It seems I can turn the controller "off" making it a "dumb" HBA--where would I find information on that topic? I havent been able to locate it.
 Can I delete the 60TB virtual disk and still boot via the 6TB array? IM ok with doing that if I have to "pass through" the individual disks...if that will even work.
 Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Which data rate can I expect with this module ?
 Which model of SFP do I have to choose to have a good compatibility ?
 The PCIe data rate is 40Gb/s, right ?

 Justification for the media servers running on windows server, that specific VM will have a gpu passed through for OBS and I would like to accelerate transcoding for media server stuff with a gpu.

 I see they offer "unlimited" seen not many but a few people say that they were capped at a certain amount of storage or their account got terminated because of this... I have a desktop PC with 12 HDD slots, Only 5 of them i think are in use atm but want to eventually store all the data from all available slots on Backblaze, Is it feasable or do you think they could decide to terminate my account based on excessive storage?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an internally hosted DNS resolver running on my network. Everything is great aside from one thing, which is I cannot load my root domain when connected over VPN. The reasoning is obvious because the zonefile maps my domain name to the internal IP of NGINX which has a ton of subdomain entries for my domain. 
 thing1.mydomain.com <- works thing2.mydomain.com <- works mydomain.com <- does not work. Specifically want to load this website from outside my network. 
 Ideally, I have a CNAME entry in the Zonefile that routes traffic, even on VPN to my site hosted externally by Cloudflare. How can I achieve this? 
 Here is my zonefile
 $ORIGIN mydomain.com. @ 3600 IN SOA sns.dns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. ( 2017042746 ; serial 7200 ; refresh (2 hours) 3600 ; retry (1 hour) 1209600 ; expire (2 weeks) 3600 ; minimum (1 hour) ) * 3600 in A 172.16.0.2 # this is private static IP I assigned to NGINX on internal network mydomain.com. 3600 IN CNAME proxy.mydomain.com. 
 The A record is good. I just added this CNAME but it does a loopback into NGINX and loads the wrong site. 
 proxy.mydomain.com is a CNAME record in Cloudflare DNS that points to mydomain.com. Doesn't work when connecting over VPN though. Maybe someone with some solid networking knowledge can explain this one to me.

I would like to use Nvidia Surround in order to combine the screens together into 1 super duper screen for when I play games. Problem is there is a giant bezel in the middle. I can physically flip 1 of the screens 180 degrees but nvidia surround does not allow me to flip only a single screen and combine them together (trust me, I've tried everything). 
 ​
 Is there some kind of adapter/box I can get that lets me flip the output before it hits the screen? 
 ​
 And before you comment "why didn't u just get the Odessy Arc, its cus the pixel density on that thing sucks and this rig is primarily for video editing which benefits workflow-wise from having it set up as 2 physical separate screens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have been running a couple applications behind a reverse proxy. I have been using NPM and it's worked well. I never did implement fail2ban or Authelia into my current setup. I do plan on implementing fail2ban this weekend when I do my server move but I have a couple questions. 
  
When it comes to Authelia, am I correct to assume it's mainly to secure applications which may not have it's own authentication method? I mean, I know you can have a double login (one for Authelia + one for the app) but that seems like maybe it's a little overkill. Am I missing anything else about Authelia?
 I saw at least one post when I was searching which suggested using CF Tunnels to protect the nGinx login. This got me thinking if there is any benefit for using Tunnels in some fashion along with my reverse proxy? Id prefer to not use Tunnels completely because I don't want CF to have unfettered access to everything coming and going from the site so Ill stick with using the reverse proxy with my own cert from lets encrypt. 
  
Anything else Im missing? I guess since Im doing this move I want to increase the security if I can. At a minimum it seems like fail2ban is a no brainer. 
 I'll also add in closing that these apps need to be publicly accessible to the wider internet so something like tail scale is not an option for this.

 Deepnote offers to share your code + the output as an embedded html (iframe) object. Examples of these embedded objects can be seen, for example, in this medium post under 4. I am looking for a self-hosted app that offers the that functionality. 
 To clarify, I am not looking for just embedded code blocks, like Github and Gitlab offer with Gists and Snippets, but also, or even only, where you can see code output. I mainly use Python. So code output in Python would be a must.
 Does anybody know of such a selfhosted app?
 Thanks alot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got an HP DL560 G8 with 5 x 480GB SSDs in a hardware raid and I'm considering wiping the system and reinstalling everything to move toward a Proxmox server instead. Currently it has a single SABRENT 4TB NVME scratch (our numerical models like fast writes of temp files) on a Highpoint SSD7101A-1 NVMe 4-Port card. I'm thinking of putting two SABRENT 512GB NVMEs in it for the OS (can Proxmox boot from the Highpoint?) and upgrading the 480GB SSDs to something much larger as a storage drive for everything else. What SSDs can I put in the system? Can I just get off the shelf Western Digital 2.5" 2TB SSDs and put them in the existing caddies?

My other options is the 2TB WD Black drive and then I’ll have to buy an enclosure/dock to power it. It’s a 7200 rpm drive and speeds are over triple the LaCie. Both setups cost around $100. I just don’t know if the enclosure will slow speeds being there are several enclosure options for 3.5 drives.

So I tried to call customer support but it just says every rep is busy. Then I try to make a support ticket, but their site is broke so I can't even put one in. I'm wondering if anyone had the same experience with customer support.
 ​
 Also how long does it normally take to get a shipping notification? It's been almost a week, and I paid extra for UPS 2 day shipping.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using dstat to check my drive usage to see if it would be feasible to have them spin down (if you want to comment on this then see my other recent post in here).
 I'm not using LVM for anything as Proxmox is installed onto a ZFS mirror and I've already added each drive to the global_filter in /etc/lvm/lvm.conf, which should prevent vgscan from accessing those drives.
 However I'm still getting regular activity on all my drives. One set of accesses happen at ~15 minute intervals, which appears to read ~247 bytes from each drive. The other set of accesses occur at ~30 minute intervals and read a mere 26 bytes per drive.
 For info, I've got 3 separate storage pools. rpool is a single mirror vdev and contains the proxmox install. Both drives are SSD's and I don't care about the activity here so they aren't included in the dstat output below.
 I've then got tank1 which is a single mirror vdev, made up of sdi and sdj. I've then got tank2 which is a single raidz2 vdev and contains sde, sdf, sdg, sdh, sdk, and sdl.
 Does anyone know what might be causing the regular access? and more importantly how to prevent it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So standard wisdom is to run a CMA up one side of your rack and data and networking up and down the other side of the rack. It is known. This is the way. So uh, obviously if you're pulling your servers out twice a month for quick hardware swaps, upgrades, tweaks, and cleaning, like I do, you'll be using cable management arms to make sure your cables don't get splinched in the slide. Pretty basic stuff here. Now the real question. If you mount, say, all your power cables on the hinge side, and your data cables on the latch side, whichever side you mount your CMA on will have to have either power or data cables run across the rear of the rack to the CMA opening around back. What do you do about that awkward run of power or data across the rear of the rack over to the CMA ? Seems quite ugly to just have a bundle of cables all the way across. What's the correct or intended way to manage that awkward run from side to side?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy folks.
 ​
 Like the title says. I don't care about noise or speed, the files I'll be backing up are usually not too big. As long as the thing is cheap and has a low chance of randomly bricking on me I'm okay with it.
 ​
 I've heard that the seagate barracuda or wd blue are good choices for what I'm looking for, but I'd rather hear it from people whom, like myself, also had their del key removed from their keyboards.
 ​
 I'm also thinking of getting an Orico enclosure, what do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In my quest to further reduce the power bill for my home lab I'm considering the merits of configuring my HDDs to spin down after a while.
 I've listed what I think are the pros and cons below, but I'm interested to hear others views on the subject.
 Pros
  
Cost saving in electricity. Potentially several W per drive, which adds up when you've got 10+ of the things.
 Slightly reduced noise when drives aren't spinning (not an issue for me)
  
Cons
  
Potential for reduced life span of drives = increased cost in replacing drives (need replacing more often)
 Increased latency when accessing files when drives have spun down (not an issue for me)
  
Have I missed anything and how much should I really be concerned with reducing the life span by spinning the drives down?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I am fairly new to the homelabe community. 
 Thanks to you guys and your effort I was able to implement a small homeserver on a Raspberry Pi 4 running a VPN server, Jellyfin and SMB/CIF shares. Also I am proud of my backup strategy which is a bash script with rsync mirroring all my data on my shares to a Windows drive on my desktop, which I shared on my network.
 So thank you all!
 ​
 But now I want to go further and tinker around with Proxmox. I might also have a use case for a friend of mine:
 He started a small engineering firm, so naturally he's a little tighter on cash.
 We are a small team (yes, I also work there part-time in addition to my main job and support him in setting up), but sometimes have quite computationally intensive workloads.
 Currently we have one workstation, which is well equipped in terms of compute power, but as soon as someone works on it, the others have to wait. The hardware would be sufficient to run our workloads in parallel. Also working from remote is not possible due to that.
 Do you guys think it would be a good idea to set up Proxmox on this PC and create several VMs for each Application we have?
 We are also using AutoCAD. Is it possible to work from remote on the VM without having it lag all the time?
 Do you guys have some nice resources to get started with Proxmox?
 I already ordered an old and cheap Thinclient to tinker around ;) 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I just installed OwnCast (install is a bit strong, I had Linode Marketplace do it) on Linode. 
 On my first go, I didn't use the Marketplace. I used Ubuntu on a Shared Nanoode 1 GB plan with Docker. When I ran my stream test, the CPU was at 100%. I didn't think that was good, so I deleted that and noticed I could use MarketPlace to install Owncast's version. 
 This time I went with the SHared Linode 2 GB. It has 1 CPU like the Nanode but has twice the ram. This time the CPU was at 60%.
 My question is, what would be the "most" adequate plan? I'd love to do this for $5/mo, but not if it's going to push the node too much. Also, would the 1cpu/2gig be enough?
 Thanks for any insights!!

I am planning on having following services to start the journey: - Jellyfin: movies/shows and maybe also music streaming to home and outside - arr stack + torrent client: to automate downloads - Some cloud storage to maybe backup pictures from phone
 Now from what I read on this sub it would be better to have the OS installed on a separate SSD instead of the SD card. Do you have any suggestions of an SSD that would be suitable? 
 Same questions for an external HDD. I'm thinking that 8tb would be more than enough at this time.
 I am looking for the lower priced SSD and HDD..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I have my server set to auto-on after power failure and the UPS depletes. But the last time that happened, I learned the hard way that my USB drive enclosure doesn't auto-on. When the server spun up, Plex didn't see about half my library and removed everything, which screwed up the whole .arr aparratus too and required significant time to rebuild those databases. 
 So, I went looking for an enclosure that will auto-power-on like my computer after failure, but I can't seem to find one. Is there a reason why not? Some electrical code thing? I could home-brew a PC case and jumper the PSU but I'd much rather have a quality purpose-built enclosure -- and something that can handle like eight drives without all the space needed for the motherboard and the rest. Even better if it took mini-SAS cables from my HBA card. Thoughts? Appreciate any help.

My thought was to keep it in the lower cabinets in the room. The room is a decent size (about 10ft x 8ft), has a large fan, and I haven’t noticed much of a difference in temperature when doing laundry. Would that be a terrible idea? I would prefer to keep it in the office, but the Ethernet wiring is only in the laundry room and I’m not sure how difficult/expensive it would be to move it to the office since it’s on the opposite side of the house (home is about 3300sq ft).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I've recently installed Apache Guacamole through Cloudron in a Proxmox VM running Ubuntu server. I'm trying to set up SSH and VNC connections to my VMs and a Raspberry Pi so I can manage my servers remotely, but I've been stuck on VNC connectivity for the last few days. I can SSH into every device fine, but VNC never works no matter what I've tried.
 Some things I've noticed when troubleshooting is that the VNC servers are extremely inconsistent when it comes to connectivity. From my desktop running EndeavourOS, I can connect to both my Raspberry Pi and a Proxmox Debian VM, but only the Pi can be interacted with as the Debian VM connects, but has no display on any VNC client software I've tried.
 However, when it comes to Guacamole, I can't connect to either of them whatsoever. I've seen dozens of forum posts and Reddit posts telling me to create vncpasswds and how to configure that in the settings, but nothing works.
 Would any of you have any insight as to why my set up isn't working as intended? Would something like RPort be a better alternative?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently trying to setup various IP-whitelist middlewares with Traefik. One thing that i would like to do is allow connections to certain services only through a VPN connection. I run the Wireguard server using wg-easy and the container is also connected to the traefik-proxy network. My subnets look like this:
  
VPN: 172.20.0.0/24
 Traefik-Proxy: 172.16.1.0/24
 docker0: 172.16.0.0/24
  
Now i would like to setup my VPN whitelist like this:  http: middlewares: ipwhitelist-vpn: ipWhiteList: sourceRange: - "172.20.0.0/24"  When i am connected to my VPN and access a service, i get a 403 forbidden, with the Traefik access log looking this: {"ClientAddr":"172.16.1.1:36904", "DownstreamStatus":403, ...}
 Looking at the routing table of the container, this does indeed make sense:
  default via 172.16.1.1 dev eth0 172.16.1.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 172.16.1.19 172.20.0.0/24 dev wg0 proto kernel scope link src 172.20.0.1 
 So traffic gets routed through eth0 (the traefik network) by default, which results in the Traefik proxy seeing it's own gateway ip address as the source. However, i would like the incoming source ip address to be my VPN gateway (172.20.0.1). Is there a way to accomplish this? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, I'm running a private discord server. I've created different channels such as "plex-notifications", "automation-notifications", "homelab-status", etc. I have webhooks set up in Discord connected with different services like Tautulli, *arr's, Uptime Kuma, and many others. Unfortunately, not everything supports webhooks so there's a service here and there that I can't set up with Discord. Despite that, this set up has worked relatively well for me over the last year ish.
 However, as a homelabber, I feel compelled to try new things out and mess with things that aren't necessarily broken. So I want to see what systems you guys have put in place to send you notifications about things going on in your network. Interested in things like how quickly you receive notifications from the time of an event, how many services have you come across that don't incorporate into your notification system, and things of that nature.
 Looking forward to hear what you all are doing. Thanks!

I was using a simple windows install with samba shares before and ideally I would want that + something like either Dropbox sync or more like just reliable incremental file backups over the net(I was looking at nextcloud/owncloud for that), it doesn't have to be windows so I was also looking at something like trueNas or open media vault. I'd like to know what software or system would suit my needs best, or any suggestions or opinions since I never used any of those before. Thanks. Ps: I'd also like to know if it's possible/easy to scale or migrate those systems but that's not something I need right now, just looking for some info.

 It's going to be a long and hard journey and it make takes years for me to get a v1.0 release but I am determined. 
 Server: https://github.com/Ortygia/Deaftone Written in Rust using SeaORM. And SQLx in the scanner
 Client: https://github.com/Ortygia/Orpheus Written in JS. Using Vue+Tailwind and Tauri for desktop and eventually mobile
 ​
 I am looking to get features for both the server and the client from people. Features that would make you switch to it if and when it eventually releases.
 ​
 I am currently having a big discussion in https://github.com/Ortygia/Deaftone/issues/7 about multi-user support and how it would be done.
 ​
 So I have a question would you rather have the same library as all users? Separate libraries each kinda like Plex/Jellyfin or a common library and a user-specific library. Where you can browse the common and user-specific libraries at the same time

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a few things on my network that require SSL certs for the same domain:
  
NGINX - I have letsencrypt set up on this VM and manually copy over certs from here to my other devices that are not behind the reverse proxy.
 Synology NAS - pain to copy to this one, but doable.
 PFSense - again a pain to copy, but doable
 Proxmox - I've set up a script on my NGINX VM to copy over the certs.
  
I feel like there is a better way to do this - any suggestions?

 Would a single 12$ Droplet (2GB / 1CPU, 50GB SSD) suffice, or is it better to still split them up (into two 6$ Droplets of each 1GB RAM)?
 I'd not be worried if both go down at the same time instead of either one, as both services would be tightly integrated after all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the the UniFi Controller (linuxserver/unifi-controller) running in a Docker container on one VM connected to a one (management) VLAN and NPM running in a Docker container on another VM connected to a another (dmz) VLAN.
 I can reach the UniFi UI just fine from a browser on the dmz VLAN when using the IP address (https://192.168.10.111:8443), but not through the reverse proxy.
 I can ping the UniFi IP from the NPM Docker host and it seems I can even curl the UniFi UI from within the NPM Docker container (although it is complaining about the certificate).
 [root@docker-npm:/app]# curl https://192.168.10.111:8443 curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: self signed certificate More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html curl failed to verify the legitimacy of the server and therefore could not establish a secure connection to it. To learn more about this situation and how to fix it, please visit the web page mentioned above. 
 This is the NPM configuration I have been using for the UniFi UI. Anyone know what I might be missing here?

 Edit: I forgot to mentioned that I am proxying a whole bunch of other services the same way. The difference is that they are on the same VLAN as the NPM, but I do not see how that is an issue as the UniFi application is clearly reachable from the VLAN NPM is on.
 SOLVED: Never mind! I forgot to add it (unifi.at.home) as a Host Override Alias for the NPM host IP. (This is what makes the internal domain name resolution work).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit,
 so I am currently considering buying an old used PC to then self-host Nextcloud on it. But as this is the first time I ever self hosted something I have a few questions:
 ​
  
How good (RAM, CPU) does a PC need to be to host just Nextcloud within let's say Fedora Linux?
  How good should the PC be if I one day decide to also host a small Minecraft Server (just for me and friends so nothing big) on it
 How are the energy costs resulting from running a Computer all day compared to just getting a subscription from some server provider?
 If the hard drive (ssd or hdd) one day breaks is it than possible for a noob like me to recover the data? How would I ensure that I definitely do not lose any data without buying a second hard drive just to copy all the content?
 How long can I expect a old Computer to work as a server?
 What do you think are the main advantages (except from data ownership) from self-hosting instead of buying a subscription?
  
​
 Please feel free to answer any of the questions if you know answers to only some of them. Also feel free to just send a link without context if some of the questions have been asked here before and then angrily down vote the post :) .
 Thank you for your help and time

Use Nextcloud official docker images(s)
 Could I know which might be the better one for long term running as I used Nextcloud in home for years, I might have lot of files to import after I settle the new server.
 Hope to hear others experience with Nextcloud with docker.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi data hoarders,
 (if this is not the right place for this kind of question, please kindly let me know)
 I'm looking for a reliable drive (and enclosure) for quiet media usage. It will be mostly used to hold and serve media, and will hold files from 1GB up to 90GB, for streaming (Plex or NFS), connected to a laptop. Essentially a poor man's NAS. Noise is a concern, from the drive itself or from enclosure fan, as this drive would be in a living room. 5400RPM would be enough. Not frequently written to either. Any suggestions considering the use case? 
 FYI, I did some research on this, but I think it's time to ask the experts. I know about SMR vs CMR, and that Helium-filled drives are supposedly from silent. Thought of perhaps buying a decent CMR drive, and put it in a fan-less 3'rd party enclosure, but I'm having a hard time choosing the hardware. There's too many options around and it's tricky to get full specs on everything, not to mention a lot of contradicting information, gets confusing fast.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking to set up my first RAID. I have (4) Samsung 870 QVO 8TB SSDs. I was thinking about getting a QNAP TR-004 and installing them. Thoughts on RAID 5 / 6 (if supported) / 10 in this situation? Alternately, I could sell 3 of the SSDs and buy (4+) 18TB Ironwolf drives in RAID 10 (due to the risk of URE?). My priority is data security and minimizing the possibility of ever needing to restore from backups. Speed is not important.
 Does anyone happen to know if the QNAP TL-D800C be used as a DAS? Or other affordable 8 bay options?
 Any suggestions in general?

 Right now I am trying to set up SSL and manage the certificates on:
  
iLO4
 OPNsense
 Proxmox
 AdGuard
 Grafana
 Uptime Kuma
 TL-SG108E
 TL-EAP225
  
I’d use Cloudflare Tunnel only if it didn’t expose/route the pages to the outside world (I’d rather the pages only load if the requests are from my VLANs, instead of having to setup email pin-code etc.). That way I could put SSL on anything easily with Cloudflare acting as a reverse proxy 
 What do y’all use to achieve this in your own homelabs?

 I currently have several Windows Server VMs for AD, Exchange, SharePoint and a few other services and I have a Windows Server 2022 Datacenter license so I was considering using that as my hypervisor since it allows me to automatically license all Windows VMs, but I was wondering if that’s a viable option or if I’m better off sticking with ESXi 6.5 or maybe moving to a different hypervisor. 
 To be honest the only advantage of using WS as a hypervisor is the unlimited licensed VMs but if the resources overhead is too high then I guess getting additional licenses for my VMs would be the best option.
 Any thoughts on that?

 I can install and browser around, but things are not configured correctly and I an error saying I'm serving untrusted URLs over HTTPs.
 I currently use lets encrypt to do TLS termination at the nginx layer.
 edit: Sorry about formatting. Classic Reddit is terrible for MD formatting and I'm in the car.

 From what I can tell looking at the config.php, I don't even think these env variables are doing anything. The whole setup is pretty confusing IMO. 
 Would anyone know how to setup these hops? I only am interested in using NGINX and ideally I want to just proxy requests through NGINX I already have running.

I want to eventually scale up from a single node cluster, to a dedicated media server, transcoding/download server, as well as a separate NAS with RAID to store all the files.
 On a very high level I'm wondering what kind of hardware would be ideal for a home media server, without going too crazy about it. I don't want to spend too much, but am willing to put down an appropriate amount, to optimize the machines for their purpose.
 My current server is fairly straightforward, a Ryzen 7 3700X, with 32GB RAM and a RX560 for HEVC decoding/H.264 encoding. It's where everything runs at the moment, but I'm wondering if this setup would be more suitable for transcodi…]]></summary>

 1 - 2014 MacBook Pro 16Gb (running Home Assistant, Portainer, and K3S Master node cluster) 2 - Raspberry Pi 4 4gb ram(running as 2 working nodes for K3S cluster) 1 - Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (running Octopi for a 3D printer) 1 - lenovo thinkcentre m700 intel i5-6500t 24gb ram (running Proxmox 7.3: Windows 11 VM only) with 128gb SSD and 1tb NVME for VM storage
 Running Home Assistant and Portainer on the MacBook Pro has been great and a perfect server to run the few docker services. 
 I’ve been struggling with Kubernetes and feel like I’m not using is to it’s potential so the VM on the MacBook and the two RPis running the working nodes is a waste of hardware. Any ideas heree? Maybe I’ll need to dedicate them to a bare metal service of some sort.
 RPi Zero 2 W is perfect for my 3d printer. 
 And now I have a Proxmox server running only Windows 11 but has so much more potential. 
 I feel like I have the necessary hardware to run all my services and more but is not much tho. How would you change it and how can I push my hardware to the limits?

 After a few hours of testing, troubleshooting and even disassembling it I'm sure it's the mainboard and not the SSDs, RAM or any other "lose" component. 
 This was my first "real" server, before I was hosting on my NAS and since I'm hosting a lot of personal stuff it really hurts atm ... 
 I bought this NUC used and I guess I had bad luck, after disassembling it I found lots of proof that someone before me did something to it (scratches, burnt soldering, etc.). 
 Before just looking for a replacement NUC I'm curious what kind of hardware you guys would recommend. Since the SSDs (1x M.2 and 1x 2,5") and the RAM (DDR4 SODIMM) are fine I of course want to reuse them in the new system.
 Price should be around 300€ if possible, the hardware should be available in EU (quick delivery time) and I'd prefer a Intel CPU with Quick Sync for Plex hardware acceleration (not a must-have tho),
 Any idea is appreciated, thanks for your help.

I understand I could use docker swarm, but I really want to learn the Kubernetes side of things and with my hardware below I think k3s is (probably?) the right fit. 
 Please review what I'm proposing below and see if anyone has recommendations/guidance, sees any pitfalls, or if this is just a bad idea due to over complexity. 
 Goals
 Multi node HA cluster. I want to be able to actually do things with my machines (move them, offline something, etc.) without everything going hard down.
 Kubernetes! Gotta learn at some point.. 
  
Hardware Available

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Me and a friend are heavily interested in establishing an ASN, and pretty much owning are own part of the internet. Purely for the use of us self hosting applications, such as mail, but also to get the experience, and work with these large enterprises and backbones. We first want to have a solid plan before we invest into anything, which we mostly have, however before we pay the $500 some dollars to establish our ASN, we obviously want to have a IPv4 block first. Would anyone know a broker or dealer that could get us a IPv4 block, doesn’t even have to be a big block, we are shooting for a /25, but could also settle with anything lower then that as well, being such that someone could subnet a small block from a bigger block they own to us. I’ve been trying to do this for 4 years now, but am finally now ready to invest my full time and energy into this. Recently came a cross this article, which is pretty similar to what we are wanting to accomplish https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2017/11/creating-autonomous-system-for-fun-and.html

My options are either to try to get a Ryzen build working with unofficial ECC support or use a DDR5 system, since DDR5 has a form of ECC as well. Does anyone have any idea how DDR5's ECC compares against true ECC memory?

 Sorry for the newbie question but I bought a mini PC to act as a home server at my house. The main use would be to deploy some docker containers that would be accessible from outside...It came with a Windows 11.
 After searching this subreddit, everyone recommended installing Proxmox.
 Can you kindly explain what is the benefit of Proxmox? especially vs ESXI or Windows + VMware workstation?
 Last "noobie" question: Can I run a wireless adapter under linux? since it is very hard to connect the PC via cable.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 i would like to use a domain in my home network to access all my different services on different ports.
 I have running proxmox with different containers and vms.
 Is it possible to setup an reverse proxy to route everything over a domain instead of the ips/hostnames? Also i wanna remap every services webinterface to port 80 or 443 with the reverse proxy.
 For example:
 pihole.mydomain.com instead of http://192.168.178.67/admin
 or
 proxmox.mydomain.com instead of https://192.168.178.2:8006
 Also everything should automatically route over https.
 This plan is only for my local home network. Nothing should be exposed.
 I read about nginx but i dont know how to setup especially with pihole running. Do you guys know any good video on youtube or a good tutorial on any blog?
 THX

 Appreciate any advice. I've been reading about iDrive, backblaze and carbonite. I suspect any of these will do but just wanted to get some more info. Thanks!

I'm trying to upload large files, such as videos, to my PhotoPrism instance over the reverse proxy but I'm unable to upload anything over 100MB. I've done somewhat extensive research and found that Cloudflare limits uploads to 100MB, so I tried setting my PhotoPrism subdomain to DNS only (gray cloud) and still cannot upload large files to my server. I've also tried modifying my php.ini file to allow larger uploads and still see no change. I've also tried adding advanced parameters inside NPM but when I do that the reverse proxy fails to resolve.
 ​
 Would someone be able to help me diagnose why these uploads fail over reverse proxy but work very quickly when I connect to my server locally? It would really help with uploading my pictures and videos from my phone when I'm away from the house. Thanks!

I'm running the test again in case the errors were false positives so might take some time to come across the errors again. 
 I understand the last digits are corruption errors, where there is a discrepancy between what is written and read for that block. Are these minor and will the drives be fine to use or should the results for new drives always score a perfect 0/0/0 with badblocks? Worth RMA even if SMART results are fine? Thanks!

 Ever since we have an issue with LFS files for repos (plz see attached error log):
 https://easyupload.io/4mjwr6
 Are we missing something? Should we have done smth else besides setting a new LFS folder location in the .ini config file for Gitea?
 Thanks for your help in advance.

 I'd prefer something that has a good GUI on the web or an iOS app. I don't really require anything more than that. Remote access would be a plus, but it's not required since I can use TeamViewer to my PC and then RDP to the rest if needed.

 What would be a good option for password-protected video sharing? Ideally I'd want something that can be played smoothly in a browser, at 1080p.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a Patriot Viper VPN110 2TB PCIE3 NVME SSD and am currently writing some heavy workloads from a video cutting software on it (I am cutting my movie collection). 
 Now the problem: When I do the first 2 or 3 runs (~180GB each), the ssd works fine at >1GBps write speed (uncompressed avi video). after that the speed stays only a couple seconds at >1GBps and then drops down to ~150MBps which lets the entire process take much longer (20 instead of 3 minutes).
 I know the SSD first fills the cache, but sometimes it writes 80GB quick before cutting down to 150MBps.
 Here is a benchmark from a review site (for the 1TB disk), even in the real-world-performance test the disk barely went under 500MBps write speed.
 I tought about thermal throttling but after addding a server fan which keeps the ssd below 35 degree C under full load I dont think thats the problem.
 Something interesting too is that even after waiting 2 hours, the ssd wont let me write a "long" time at >1GBps again, only when I shut down the computer.
 Can someone explain this weird behaviour?

 I am searching for a bookmark tool which can be selfhosted (bacause of privacy concerns) an be used by multiple team members. I tried fluccus already, but we ran into sync issues which wiped the changes which were done by one team member earlier. 
 We established a workaround for this, that we set the agent to read-only and enable read-write to the database only when we do actual changes, but maybe someone has a better solution for this. 
 Also tried xbrowsersync which didn't work either.
 Thanks for helping and happy new year!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I've been lurking here a while but since I am relatively new at this stuff please let me know if this is the wrong place to ask. I am just starting my journey creating a local network. I have set up Plex and pi-hole on Dockers in my server running OMV (old laptop), and a very close friend gave me a license for Mullvad. It would be awesome to add this vpn to my whole network instead of one device, specially if I can turn it on and off easily. Is this even possible? What I have found online so far ranges from people saying it is not possible to people saying it is and I should use Wireguard on a rPie, but in my case it feels like using docker is the best way to go. I already route everything in my network to the pi-hole in the server through my router... Would it work to just route pi-hole to the VPN or send everything to Mullvad in my router config and then send mullvad to the pi-hole? If this is too confusing please lemme know

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello - I am a video editor with about 80tb of data. Originals are on two qnap four bay DAS, working files are on a 50tb OWC thunderbolt, and everything gets backed up to a 8 bay 70tb qnap (with a 4 bay qnap as overflow) . I need off site but money is an issue. It’s taken me a lifetime to acquire the drives and enclosures I have. I was considering buying 5 WD 20tb mybooks , and storing them at my parents a few miles away. But I know u won’t like that so I wanted to hear this subs better ideas. That would cost me 1500-2000 which is kinda absolute max. I’ve also considered idrive for cloud instead , but I’m not sure that will be economical . Especially over long term. I originally wanted another server at my parents house that I could back up to over the internet. But I don’t think It makes sense for me to spend that kind of money. I have very basic knowledge of this stuff based on just using my qnap. I don’t know anything about advanced IT. I am using a Mac.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I tried to search for this topic but couldn't find anything that matched my setup.
 I have a VMware ESXi server running both internal and external servers. External servers are isolated on a single VLAN that has only access to internet, so they are isolated from the rest of the internal network.
 Now I want to isolate each server from the others on this "external" VLAN, so that each of the webservers (for example) can only talk to the reverse proxy server, but not with each other.
 What would be the best, easiest (and cheapest) way to accomplish this?
 I would like to...
  
avoid using a local firewall on each server (Ubuntu), unless it can be centrally managed somehow.
 avoid using multiple VLANs in order to keep network traffic on the host. So traffic doesn't have to go from the router, to the reverse proxy, back to the router and then to the VM.
  
How do/would you do it, to keep public facing servers safe from each other?

I'm new to all of this so I just wanted to get a basic game plan going before I end up breaking these things.

 - There are not many options for server cases on Brazil
 - Not everyone ships to Brazil. When they do, it's 5x the case's price

 So I'm inclined to fabricate one (not me, someone specialized). Where can I buy the schematics for an 4u case? Apparently Protocase have a design service, is there other options which I'm not aware of? Thanks in advance.

 I'm doing something similar but didn't use the clever pseudo-random algorithm used by the other user vanceza. I just formatted ExFAT and dumped the same set of randomly generated data stored as txt files to each drive.
 The intent is to check if data is lost while SSD remains unpowered over 1,2,3,4 years time both on a well worn and fresh SSD.
 Test disks are four 128GB 2.5" SATA SSD's. Some cheap Chinese Leven SSD (JS600). I grabbed a five pack for like $60. Disassembling the last non-test disk SSD revealed some Leven branded NAND flash (JA28A2TB00 - 2148).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At least here in germany it feels like 99% of self-hosted services are running on hardware/servers from Hetzner or Netcup. While I am actually satisfied with both of them, I am wondering if there are some other players with good hardware for a good price. I am not unhappy or disappointed in any way. Just trying to get an overview.
 I tried Contabo but wasn't happy. Feels like their higher tiers are somewhat okay, but once the server is running to many instances your VPS is slowing down more and more.
 I am really just looking for older and established companies that will most likely not stop their business next week due to miscalculation or other problems. So non of those reseller-reseller-resellers^^

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I would like to achieve the following:
  
Various servers I have to send data at regular intervals to a central server/website (cloud hosted or hosted by me). I don't want the reverse to happen (server to contact the various hosts, and having to open ports)
 Send "heartbeat" data ("I am alive") and the central server alerting if something is down (no "alive" message detected after x minutes)
 Send very basic data like CPU usage over the last minute, 5 minutes, RAM, storage. Maybe 5 or 10 data metrics
  
I need the "agent" to be very lightweight, as some of those servers are low spec (like 1GB of RAM, or even 512MB).
 I have tried to install NetData but it brought several servers to their knees during the install. I have tried Prometheus, which seems fine but overkill for the task (and also it seems that the server is contacting the hosts).
 I could also do my own version (running a Python script every few minutes to post data to a website), or maybe have Python use MQTT to send messages to a MQTT server, but I would prefer to have an already built solution.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've been searching for a day or two for an older Intel BIOS for my DQ77KB motherboard. I know Intel pulled everything from their site years ago and an effort was made to grab everything available as fast as possible. 
 Unfortunately, the massive 342GB archive has my bios, but version 0061 which is extremely buggy (broken LAN, voltage, temp monitoring). Intel even went as far as removing the forum sections on their community page so I can't even find workarounds to these issues.
 So with this in mind, I'm wondering if someone here might have Intel DQ77KB BIOS v0058? The filename would be KB0058.BIO and the Intel download mirror number would have been 25621. 
 For now I'm going to slap another NIC in the machine, but really hoping to go back to the last stable BIOS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start by saying I have had no experience with any of this sort of thing prior to this project, so please explain like I'm 5 :)
 I'm trying to convert a whole bunch of 8mm tapes for my family. Half of them play on a Sony Handycam I have, which I'm using a firewire cable to transfer to my computer. Due to the format of the tapes, the other half will only play on an older camcorder, which just I ordered off of eBay. Problem is that the older model (Sony Handycam CCD-TRV37) has no micro USB port to use firewire. From what I understand, the best way to convert these tapes is with the use of an audio/video capture card (essentially just composite to usb). I know that using this method will lead to some quality loss of the footage, but if it's the only way then it's better than nothing.
 These capture card cable thingies range from like 10 to 100 dollars online. Has anyone used this method to convert old tapes? Does it matter which one I buy, or can I just get a cheaper one? Do you have any recommendations for what software is best for this process? 
 Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started out self hosting on a little NUC (4-core, 32 GB RAM, SSD+HD+USB HD) running Ubuntu in my closet, and have now grown to hosting quite a few apps on it, some of which are "mission critical". Also, the prospect of spending a day reconfiguring everything if the machine goes down is quite scary. I'm running docker for apps that are come dockerized, but I haven't invested in learning to dockerize individual apps on my own to make them easier to backup and restore.
 Bottom line, I'm looking to make the hardware more fault tolerant (RAID array?) and the software easier to restore (Proxmox with VMs and Docker containers?). Right now, I'm worried about even upgrading Ubuntu, which has given me headaches before.
 I'm currently running:
  
zoneminder (want to move to frigate) (apt install)
 homeassistant (pip install)
 paperless-ngx (docker)
 jellyfin (docker)
 nextcloud (docker)
 offlineimap + notmuch + netviel (offline searchable IMAP archive) (manual install)
 kopia (manual install)
  
Option #1: More hardware + Proxmox - Upgrade machine to full tower supporting RAID (also requires upgrading my UPS and maybe installing an exhaust fan in my closet)
 Option #2: Same hardware + Migrate to Proxmox (temporarily moving all services to somewhere else)
 Option #3: Move less critical services (homeassistant, etc.) to raspberry pi, etc to reduce monolith risk
 Option #4: Simpler disaster recovery (is there some way to easily image the entire machine regularly?)
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick question here, I''ve noticed my QNAP NAS does constant HD access. It cannot enter sleep/suspend because of the amount of background programs running on newer QTS. Investigating Synology seems similar, sleep functions might work, but tons of constant HD Access ticks, no matter what. 
 I am not a very complex user, I just use it as a file server. I do love the form factor and easy functionality of these NAS' but I can't stand the constant noise it makes. All the "quiet nas" reviews and videos focus on quietest hard drives and the most sound proof NAS case/enclosures. It seems like almost no one is focusing on the operating system these run on and how much noise is created when you aren't accessing the NAS at all ! 
 My question is: Is there any NAS that doesn't run a ridiculous amount of background tasks, asustor or terramaster etc ? anyone have experience with these operating systems ? As hilarious as it may sound, I would like the drives to operate in the way windows operates, in the sense that, if you aren't accessing the drives, they don't make a single sound. Why can't any NAS be like this ?

 Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask.
 Fairly new to Ubuntu, but as an IT guy, I've had enough exposure to it to be comfortable working with it, and I'd like to think I can pick it up pretty quickly, so feel free to nerd out on me!
 I'm creating myself a home media server, I've got a little NUC (i5, 16gb RAM, 256 SSD) which I'd like to make my usenet box, using Ubuntu, and ultimately Docker to get it going, my plex server is going to run on a different box too, but that's currently setup anyways and working fine, I just want to add a bunch of automation to it
 I've followed this guide - Docker Media Server Ubuntu 22.04 with 23 Awesome Apps | SHB (smarthomebeginner.com) - Which is amazing, but, I can't see my NAS (i have added NFS mount points and can upload into it from Ubuntu directly, just SABNZD doesn't see it at all, I did a few permission changes, but nothing changed.
 I've found this link, is this going to allow me to see my NAS from the Containers in Docker? 
 NFS Docker Volumes: How to Create and Use | phoenixNAP KB 
 I'm going to start again, I'd like to stick to Ubuntu purely for the benefit of more exposure to another OS. I can't find any guides on setting up with a NAS as Storage, but I imagine it's just my lack of understanding of the OS and Docker for how it works rather than it not being possible
 TIA

 I would also like to be able to tune in live on my phone using something like tinyCam Monitor

 Could a Pi Zero power an IR USB webcam? Could I record straight to my server and still tune in to view live? Which software would you recommend?

 I'm in the midst of building out my 12U racked home network and upgrading to Ubiquiti network / protect and thinking about how to tweak my home server.
 The home server is a Plex box that is essentially 2 x 12TB drives coupled to a HP EliteDesk 800 G2 with a i5 6600T Quad Core 3.5 GHz and 16GB of RAM. It's solid and super low power but I've already lost one of these drives (warranty ftw!) which is really annoying to recover from. 
 I'm in the market for a 1U or 2U option but hoping to find something with options for several drives, RAID and something that isn't crazy high power / loud or can be configured to run as such. I've been looking at the Dell R720 and equivalent HP but curious what other folks are using. I'd prefer not to use a NAS or Synology, etc as I like to get in there and tinker (for better or worse).
 Any thoughts/tips/ideas or posts folks can point me at?

 let me explain my setup a bit, i currently have a linux vm running some services on my local nas in my house and i want to publish those services to the internet so anyone can use them.
 I thought it would be cool (and safe!) to just use a cheapo vps with a tailscale tunnel to my vm and use that vps as a reverse proxy so everybody can reach the public vps, and then only the vps uses tailscale to my local vm entering my local network.
 is this possible? i know for shure that i am missing some steps here but i want to learn.
 is this safer than some other possibilities? i dont want to host my services online cause i'll need to rent a pretty beefy vps for that and i already have the hardware which is capable of running those things in home.
 dont tell me to use a dmz cause i dont have control over router (not actually "my" house...) and neither have a public ip (isp doing natting shit).
 There's a way i can accomplish what i want? thanks!

 For the longest while I just used linux for everything and I'd used rsync to backup all my data (photos, code, projects, configurations, etc.) to a local NAS device. This was simple and easy as I just had the one machine and rsync was simple.
 In recent years I now have a couple of linux machines and a couple windows machines at home that I'd like to keep synced/backed up. I see there are some solutions to using rsync on windows but I thought I'd see if there is some more robust cross-platform solution, or if not more robust, more tailored to this scenario.
 My requires are essentially:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon r/selfhosted,
 I had a small non profit Healthcare clinic that is looking for either a self hosted (free) or low cost cloud employee shift scheduling software. Something similar to hotschedules.
 Mainly we are hoping to find one that has a phone companion app (Android and iPhone) with web access also available.
 The main concern is they have mostly open schedules and want employees to sign up for the open slots. (Ala picking up free shifts) however I am finding it really hard to find a self hosted or even cloud hosted that allows the employees to pick up shifts.
 Please let me know if you have any suggestions or recommendations!
 Thank you!

 Currently the process goes,
 Hold an auction for staff with the money going to charity (this is all done by emails).
 Anything not sold sits in a store room until we either hold another auction or get some tech recyclers to come and get it. 
 So I figured there must be an easier way, someone must have posted some open source site to be able to do something like these? 
 A lot of what I've seen so far doesn't seem great, has anyone got any recommendations?

 I just recently bought my first NAS (Asustor 6 Gen 2) and some seagate Ironwolfs (4TB HDDx4) with it.
 After setting everything up and the RAID 5 syncing drive, one reported bad sectors: https://imgur.com/v1jI2kx 
 I searched it up a little and as far I can tell, HDD drives have fault tolerances and as long as the bad sector count doesn't increase it is not a problem, but no definitive answer on what should I do.
 Is this enough for me to return the Drive to the vendor and request a new one? Should I?

 From what I've read online I could do something like this:
  
Use exFAT format on my HDDs so each OS can read-write on them natively, but this format type gets easily corrupted.
 Maybe use my Windows machine to set up the HDD as a network drive through SMB and just use NTFS. (use Windows machine as proxy to write/read from each OS)
  
I think that a NAS is overkill since I don't need the data to be always online. I just want to backup important data on the HDDs and forget about it, but would like to be able to access it from each machine that I own.
 ​
 Is there a better way to do this?

 ​
 The components:
 CPU: Intel 10100
 MOBO: Asus H510M-E
 Storage: Western Digital 4TB WD Red Plus 
 case: Fractal design node 304
 ram: Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz
 ​
 My home server will mainly be used to host jellyfin, a VPN(to access my network remotely), a portfolio website, DNS, and to create a local file server.
 And Im wondering how to do it. 
 ​
 Im thinking about just downloading Debian and running jellyfin on it and my file server and creating VMs for the rest which will run on top of the os. 
 ​
 or 
 ​
 using a hypervisor like proxmox to create VMs for each purpose. I heard Quicksync will not work this way and I hear having a media server on a VM is just asking for trouble. 
 ​
 I hear docker could be an option but I don't have enough knowledge of docker and don't really understand it, maybe one of you could enlighten me. 
 ​
 Im currently at a loss at the moment on how I should set this server up to be effective and easy to back up. 
 ​
 I really want to be able to back up my saved media.

 The filesystem on my storage server got corrupted from a sudden power loss during boot caused by a hardware failure. I've never had to recover a RAID array using ReFS before, but I heard the process was relatively painless thanks to the "resilient" nature of the filesystem itself and the accompanying diagnostic utility ReFSUtil.
 Then I saw this error message.
 Seriously, what the fuck is this? Did MS actually release an update to a filesystem designed for maintaining data integrity which actually makes the associated data recovery and diagnostic tool incompatible!? 
 What the actual fuck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year!
 SimpleX Chat now supports disappearing messages – the most frequent request from the users.
 To use them both conversation parties should agree to it, unlike in most other messengers that allow to send disappearing messages without recipients' agreement. Our logic here is the same as for irreversible deletion of sent messages (this feature was added in 4.3).
 What do you think about it?
 This version also added:
  
connection security code verification – it allows to confirm that the connection keys/addresses were not substituted (man-in-the-middle attack).
 "live" messages – they update to all recipients as you type them, every several seconds.
 French language interface - thanks to users community and Weblate.
  
See more details in this post and download the apps via the links here.
 Please ask any questions about SimpleX Chat in the comments! Some common questions:
 Why user IDs are bad for privacy?
 How SimpleX delivers messages without user profile IDs?
 How SimpleX is different from Session, Matrix, Signal, etc.?

 I work with a big amount of files that I need to acces daily so I really don't want to use external drives for that matter. My 1TB drive is always full and 2TB just won't be enough in a long run (yes I want to use it for games too)
 I am keeping the m.2 purely for OS and some essentional programs so my only option is to replace the 2,5" drive.
 Are there any high capacity hdd for laptops or should I just cash out 500€+ for ssd?
 I know about the Seagate barracuda 2,5" but they aren't the most reliable and it may not even fit to my laptop due to it's height.
 Thanks for any suggestions :)

 I love notion. But I love self-hosting more. I'm going to need to switch soon to a self-hosting alternative and I can't find the perfect replacement. I love notion's databases, freedom of customizing properties and views. In summary, I'd really love a self-hosting project management tool that allows me to: Create a task database that allows me too see in a list, board and timeline views
 ​
 Does someone recommend me a good alternative? I've checked outline but it seems lacking a lot of these features, plus they over rely on google and slack... And I'm also planning on creating a rocket.chat server for a self-hosted slack alternative.

 My goal is to have an offline copy of many wiki sites with images, I can do this with wget but it takes ages and I'm thinking there has to be an easier way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I came across docker-radarr-extended when I was looking into a way to download trailers alongside my movie files, and this image seems to be what I'm looking for. It uses custom scripts to configure Radarr, as well as provides one that downloads the trailers, so I'm curious to know if I can just plug-and-play replace my current Radarr container with this image.
 At the moment I'm using the Radarr image from LinuxServer, which this is based off of, and have a custom configuration for the way Radarr should name and organize movies, so I would be disabling the enableAutoConfig which will hopefully avoid it from overriding my configuration.
 Besides that, I have volumes set-up in K3s for Radarr, and already a large collection of movies that its tracking as well as indexers from Prowlarr and download clients. I just want to make sure that this image won't change any of that setup, which I don't expect it to, since it should just be the same LinuxServer image with additional scripts, but was wondering if anyone has had the situation where they migrated from Radarr to this extended image.
 Thanks in advance for any input!

I was not able to find a solution to combine them all together, so I have given up on that option. Joplin will stay as a read-later solution. Dashy, which I have chosen as a locally hosted dashboard will host a few links from Papaly's quick access bar that I access multiple times a day. There is still the choice for an app that will host the bulk of links currently residing in Papaly pages, Raindrop, and Google bookmarks.
 I have searched through Selfhosed listings, searched the web for solutions, and cut the choice down to three options: 
  
Linkding, 
 Linkace,
 Servas. 
  
I cannot avoid running each one of them for a few days and seeing the solution for myself. That was the way I have found that I do not like Wallabag, while from reading about it it seemed like a perfect solution. But, when one runs a solution for a few days one can miss some options or characteristics.
 So, before I start my test run, I want to hear from those of you who have chosen not to use one of those three, what made you choose to avoid them, and I want to hear from those of you who are using one of those three, what made you choose them and do you have any regrets you found about later while using it.
 Thank you

 As we know, older Apple devices after the end of support quickly lose functionality. I have one of these devices - "iPad Mini 1", which despite of it's advanced age was still ok. I thought it would make a great dashboard for my mini server rack. This is where the adventure begins.
 Problems
  
Safari completely refuses to navigate to pages with a port specified, which means that the dashboard must be available on standard ports 80/443. We will use nginx in front.
 iOS 9 contains legacy root certificates, which, fortunately, can be easily installed. Because my home services are running on LE-certificates, this option came in handy.

 For those who don't know about Budibase, it's an open-source low-code platform (GUI) that saves you time and effort building internal tools.
 To kickstart 2023, we have a new release that will speed up the dev process when building internal tools:
 New side panel (total CRUD in 1 screen)
 You can now view records in a side panel. What's also super cool is you can continue to navigate records whilst the side panel is active. This reduces the number of screens you have to use and creates a smooth and faster experience for end-users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy homelabbers! 
 I’m currently running a 3 node Proxmox cluster with a tiered Ceph storage pool backing my media library, which is advertised to the network via an SMB share running on a Windows Server VM. I run Plex separately on an M1 Mac Mini and don’t plan to change that. 
 My current issue is that due to the limitations of how Ceph is implemented, I have 33% space efficiency. I’d like to migrate to something like ZFS/ReFS and drastically increase that efficiency, but I’m a little overwhelmed with all of the options.
 As I see it, there are 3 routes I can go from here to get more space out of my current storage, and make it much easier to add capacity in the future:
  
 Build my own dedicated NAS server running either my Windows Server install or migrating to TrueNAS (don’t really care which one, comfortable with both *Nix and Windows)
  Buy an off the shelf NAS
  Buy/Build a JBOD enclosure and pass it through to my Windows install.
  
I’ve been leaning towards number 3 because I don’t really want another entire bare metal system taking up space and power, and I don’t really want to pay the prices Synology/QNAP are asking for off the shelf NAS offerings with enough bays to hold my current drive collection and my planned increase in drives. I am aware that by migrating to a JBOD, I will lose the capability to migrate my NAS management VM between Proxmox nodes like I can right now, but given that media isn’t a critical service, I can live with that.
 Can someone help me understand if I’m leaning the right way, and if so, how all of the JBOD stuff works? I keep seeing conflicting information about if a JBOD passes through individual drives to the managing system, or if they are exposed as one single “drive” that the JBOD itself manages/pools together. I’m not super picky about which OS I need to use or which file system is “best”, I just want to get more out of my drives than I get right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I self-host a lot of services and I’ve never felt the need to purchase a UPS. But since I’ve invested a lot of money into hardware, now I’m having second thoughts. When googling UPSs, most I’ve found can only signal a safe shutdown to a single machine, and therein lies my conundrum. I don’t know how to go about solving this problem and it’s looking like it will cost a fortune to solve this problem. 
 This is what my home lab looks like, hardware wise (all of these machines are in a single small room):
 * 2 x NUC Ubuntu servers. These are the workhorses and my priority.
 * A Synology DS920. I invested a lot of money on this thing and would be devastating if a power outage would corrupt the drives.
 * Motorola MG8702 modem/router. Would be nice to keep internet in the event of an outage, but meh.
 * 1 x Gaming Windows PC. It was a $3k investment, but I turn it off when I’m not gaming. I’m not so worried.
 * 2 x Macbook Pros. These don’t need the UPS.
 * 2 x Ultrawide gaming monitors. These don’t need the UPS. 
 Do I have to get multiple UPS machines, 1 per machine, to safely shutdown all of that in an event of a power outage? Or is there a single UPS I can buy that can signal all of them? What are my options? What do you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Ubuntu server 22.04 as my server system, and I'm having trouble realizing full possible performance to my remote filesystem living on a VPS.
 I tried both sshfs and curlftps, and I'm only getting around 60-70 Mbit/s when transferring a file from the remote filesystem to my server. About 500 Mbit/s should be possible.
 These are my /etc/fstab mounts:
 sshfs#user@my.vps.com /mnt/vps fuse _netdev,Ciphers=aes256-ctr,cache=yes,kernel_cache,compression=yes,reconnect,ServerAliveCountMax=3,ServerAliveInterval=5,identityFile=/path/to/ssh_key,allow_other 0 0 curlftpfs#user:password@my.vps.com /mnt/vps_ftp fuse auto,user,uid=1000,allow_other,_netdev 0 0 
 as I said, both mounts only allow about 12.5% of performance. I did a copy with
 cp /mnt/vps/test.file ~/test.file and cp /mnt/vps_ftp/test.file ~/test.file 
 the results are identical. I also did a download of the same file with curl
 curl -u user:password -o ~/test.file https://my.vps.com/test.file 
 here I get the full performance of 500 Mbit/s
 Also, I "double" my performance when I copy 2 files in parallel by doing this in multiple terminals:
  cp /mnt/vps/test.file ~/test.file cp /mnt/vps/test2.file ~/test2.file 
 I tried several guides for boosting the performance of sshfs (switching cyphers tuning network parameters) to no avail. Also ftp performance equally bad which is not using any encryption
 Is there a setting that I'm missing why my remote shares are performing so badly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm looking for some input and feedback or ideas on how to best backup photos/videos from my mobile devices(a Android phone and iPad) and manage them.
 My current setup is that I use resilio sync to copy the files to my home server(a headless debian server) and this part works excellent. I really like resilio. Resilio dumps all the files into one folder and I then use a cli app(sortphotos) to organize the photos. I then use photoprism to view and review/delete crappy photos.
 My issue is: 
 When I delete bad photos within photoprism, the next time I use sortphotos to copy new images over, it will recopy the crappy photos as well. 
 Is my setup/workflow just not that good? I want to be able to keep most the images on the devices as well since it's faster/easier to show people the photos when I'm not at home. 
 Thanks!

I am a student home on winter break so I am going to need to configure my lab for remote access if I wish to use it while I am away for the spring semester. What is the best way to go about doing this securely? Should I use a VPN to do this or is SSH with passwords disabled sufficient? Or a VPN and SSH?
 If anyone has some resources or some general steps that I should take for setting up remote access it would be really helpful! Apologies if these are really basic questions, I am very new to this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've searched online and this subreddit for guides, but either the discussion goes beyond my understanding, or out of the scope of what i'm trying to accomplish.
 Essentially, I have a couple of machines, one running TrueNAS, and one running Proxmox with a couple of VMs for ubuntu with docker/minecraft servers, etc.
 Each one has a local ip address, and in the case of the ubuntu vm running docker containers, ip address with ports.
 Basically, instead of typing 192.168.x.xxx or 192.168.x.xxx:xxxx to access my servers, I want to be able to type something like truenas.com to access my NAS, or homelab.com to access my ubuntu server, with the docker containers being accessed like filebrowser.homelab.com, or portainer.homelab.com, instead of using ports.
 I've seen reccomendations for Traefik or DNS servers like using pihole, but I'm not interested in using another adblocking service, since i already use adguard.
 I'm a bit of a novice to this stuff, so any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I cannot seem to get a good take on this and just keep faltering. I have tried many takes from others but I don't see how adding PUID/PGID solves my problems when trying to add a container (Radarr).
 All the steps say these docker compose containers are so easy and just add 1000 for PUID and PGID and permissions problems will be solved.
 But I have two problems even when I do this
 Lets take my docker compose file for example:
 services: radarr: container_name: radarr image: 'linuxserver/radarr:latest' environment: - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 - UID=1000 - GID=1000 - TZ=America/New_York volumes: - '/home/USER/serverfiles/configs/radarr:/config' - '/mnt/data/media/movies:/movies' - '/mnt/data/torrents/movies:/downloads' ports: - '7878:7878' restart: unless-stopped 
 So once I do compose up it creates a config folder with an ownership and group ID of 10999. Or something in that realm in the 10,000s. So I have read up on sudo chowning folders and utilizing but then once I take control of the folder the program no longer is accessible.
 Also the program never has access to my external mnt or doesn't have permissions to access it.
 I am not the root user on the computer Ubuntu. I don't want to run the webservice as root. So trying to be protective I want to run it as my user. User 1000. But I don't know how to get the docker to be able to interact with my host machine in a good way it seems.
 I'm using Ubuntu and Docker Desktop
 What is weird is my NGINX / Jellyfin / AdGuard Home work 100% fine and I didn't even specify the PUID on those. I have that hosted and working correctly.
 Any help would be appreciated because I'm almost certain this is me just not understanding docker and permissions about them.

 First of all it seems what I try, a Searx install, in docker or a docker install in SearXNG I keep getting only html and the backend stuff. What should I try?
 Second I have this problem with running the docker version of both Searx and SearXNG. What should I do?
 And third it seems that I can't run it in docker in background so basically I need to keep both laptop and VPS running and it's useless of me keeping the search engine on. What do I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web Portal Lite V1.1 is now released, bringing an enhanced ui. Image and more below.
 What Is Web Portal Lite
 Web Portal Lite is a web dashboard to manage a page of links. It offers a minimal feature set to the feature rich Web Portal. Designed for users who just want to create a fancy looking links page and not worry about the advanced features. Unlike Web Portal which features a full ui editor, this "lite" version uses a basic yaml file for configuration.
 Why Another Dashboard App?
 Due to my eye condition, I wanted something that was easier to see. So I built one. I have made it customizable by using CSS variables and config options such as the link colors and size. It also has no need for JavaScript since everything is configured by a single yaml file, making it fast to load on slow devices.
 What's Changed
  
Style improvements
 Now arm64 compatible
 Ability to generate template config from CLI
  
Features
  
Built in Rust
 Access a grid of beautiful links to your web services
 Works without JavaScript, to provide a lightning fast experience
 Customise dashboard through a basic yaml file (no database needed)
 Wide range of link colors (or no color)
 Provide your own app icons for links
 Create groups of links
 Optionally secure the portal with user accounts
 Icon based theme
 Dark/Light mode
 Lightweight Docker image

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm slowly rebuilding my file server, which right now has a single WD80EMZZ I shucked from an EasyStore enclosure. Currently I'm looking at the WD Blue 8TB, which has the model # WD80EAZZ. What are y'alls thoughts on these drives? They don't seem that bad on paper, with the only immediately obvious difference to my EMZZ being 128MB of cache instead of 256MB (they even have the same kinda weird 5640RPM spindle speed).
 For what it's worth, I'll be starting out with 9 drives installed in a Define 7 and going from there, so there is certainly some vibration tolerance that I feel should be taken into consideration.
 The price on them is certainly right, but if they're not a good match for a server use-case then I'll just have to suck it up and hold off on an EasyStore/Elements to go on an equally-good sale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Scientific Atlanta PC115-60. It’s a 2U rack mount power distribution unit with 8 switched and 4 unstitched outlets - all front facing; there’s nothing on the back side. It’s quite old but works well. Makes an initial hum when I flip its power switch, then the hum dies down. (Still audible but much more quiet.)
 Google has apparently never heard of it - No results.
 Anyone ever seen one of these and know anything about it? I’m not sure if it’s just a PDU or a PDU + surge protector or a PDU + power conditioner or…?
 I’d post pics but I can’t figure out how.

Six core ryzen 5 with 64gb ram
 open media vault 6 (debian 11)
 boot and os on SSD
 databases on SSD
 configs and ~/torrent/incomplete on SSD (3 SSD total)
 zraid array with my media, backups, and ~/torrents/complete
  
I have a pi4 that's always on for another task; I'm going to be setting up syncthing to mirror the backup dir in my zraid.
 Duplicati has crossed me for the last time. Thus ,I'm looking for other options. I started looking into this a while back but injury recovery came up. I understand that there are many options however I'd love to hear from there community.
 I'm very comfortable with CLI and would be comfortable executing recovery options that way. I run the servers at my mom's and sisters houses, so I already do maintenance for them that way via Tailscale.
 I'm looking for open-source or free options, and my concerns orbit around two points:
  
backing up container data: I'm looking at a way to fully automate the backup process of a) shutting down each app or app+database prior to backup, b) completing a backup, and c) restarting app(s).
 
backing up my system so that I if my boot/os SSD died I could flash another and off I go.
 
 Amy advice it opinions would be warmly recieved. Thank you.

I've figured out how to convert everything into a blu-ray friendly ISO and I'm burning it using ImgBurn, and all that seems to be working. But every time I test the disc in a player, about 10 minutes in (not always the exact time, but around there) there's about one second of crazy visual artifacts around the screen.
 It looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/eJN8BN0.jpg
 I of course checked the original video file and it's not there, so it seems to be happening during the burning process. Is there some common thing that causes this, and a good way to avoid it? I tried burning at 2x instead of 4x speed and it's still showing up, which was the only idea I had.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fairly new to Docker and the whole homelab/self-hosted world. I'm a backend developer (Django) and always preferred to have my dev environments hosted on Ubuntu VMs using VirtualBox. Been resisting Docker for almost 4 years now, but I think it's about time I started this venture.
 One of the common practices when spinning up a new environment is to have both the DB and Django in one docker-compose file, and a docker file for Django. I find this tedious in a homelab environment and would prefer to have one Postgres server for all the local apps I work on.
 When I tried this, I was faced with the issue of my apps not able to connect to the centrally hosted Postgres server. Further experimentation revealed to me that it's because my containers are hosted on different networks. Took me about 2 days to notice that, but I'm enjoying the unravelling of the homelab "mysteries" so far.
 My question is how do you go about configuring such an environment? Do you usually host a separate DB server for each app or do you centralize your DB server? If I were to go with the latter, and without adding the complexities of VLANs for now (isolating the DB server, firewalls, etc), what is my best option to allow traffic in/out on port 5432 for my main Postgres server? Is it host networking?
 I know to some this might seem 101, but some guidance would be highly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I guess I'm not the only magazine hoarder and since the files are much smaller than say movies or iso files, those add up really fast.
 I would like to find a way to be able to browse this collection a bit like a Plex server, to be able to browse the covers, mark a magazine as read, add tags etc.
 I specify that I tested the Komga server which is perfect for comics/manga but not at all suitable for magazines. This is because Komga can only support (in magazine display and processing) one level of folders. Thus, in the case of a tree structure organized by year of publication, it will consider each year as a different magazine...
 Maybe a simpler solution exists. How do you do it dear hoarders?

 so I own something on physical media like a cd or dvd and I make a backup of it digitally. but what if I don't own the dvd or cd anymore? what can I do with the physical media? do I have to bin it? and can't resell it, right? can a person give it away for free to someone? I know its possible to buy software licence's from other people who bought a digital serial number to unlock software and no longer wish to own it. in those instances the software is transferred and that original owner no longer owns it, is the same principle applied to cd's and dvds? if the person sells it on then they can't keep a copy (?)
 I mean, it's far less clutter to just store all that media on a hard drive and then just get rid of the discs! I have had people give music and films to me for free, I don't want to keep the discs but wouldn't mind having a digital copy, should I bin the disc, donate it, or sell it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a small "integrated" transport activity. I looked on CodeCanyon for a Uber like solution, that would actually allow my customers to be able to see when their freight/packages arrive. Basically clients register and put order in, driver closest aknowledges that he can pick-up and deliver the freight/package, when pick-up scans the BOL ( Bill of Lading ) into the system, drives, delivers, scans signed BOL into the system ( maybe even scan directly the PDF on phone/tablet ). What I have seen in CodeCanyon is 2 or even 3 things combined, on separate systems (PHP/Firebase/Android), it will be costly to implement and not 100% sure it will work as intended.
 Seeing I work between 1-5 trucks at the moment, it does not make sense to me to invest too much into it ( 6% margin in transport in great economy ). I also have a NAS I can use to host ( WD MyCloud Home ), or cloud hosting available. And not really needed dedicated Android/IOS apps, as I understand PWA ( progressive web app ) might do the same function.
 What do you guys think? Am I crazy, or am I crazy?
 I am also not a programmer. I dabble in PHP installs, but that is about all ...
 Hit me like a rolling ball!

Server #1 nginx reverse proxy, vaultwarden, gitea, etc.
 Server #2 jellyfin
 Server #3 adguard
  
I have a wildcard certificate for the reverse proxy and I don't want to have to distribute that certificate to every server. All the things on server #1 are easy to set up, just proxy_pass the appropriate port and you're good to go. The other servers are a little trickier. I could proxy_pass with their IP and port, however nothing is stopping a user from accessing IP:port of that server directly. I could use UFW to only allow traffic from the IP of the reverse proxy, but with ARP spoofing I can sit between the proxy and the server and see all the unencrypted traffic. 
 I've never used VLANs, I don't own a switch or a router which allows for them, and I'm not entirely sure what features they provide but I've seen them used to isolate local networks. Would using VLANs be the right way to solve this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using rsync to mirror media drives (primarily media files) for manual backups for years. It's straightforward but it's lacking:
  
Renaming is treated as a whole different file, so renaming files make backing up extremely inefficient.
 
I use a wrapper script to keep a list of rsync logs as well as list of files on the drive after the last backup. Actually, I create a empty placeholder files on my filesystem and use fsearch to quickly search all files on the system including these placeholder files to quickly find if I have an existing file of that name.
 
 I know there are some rsync-based wrappers that might handle the filename change limitation, but I'm wondering if a dedicated backup software like Restic/Kopia/Borg is appropriate. I'm particularly interested in Kopia as it seems to be performant and modern in design (I know Borg is tried and true but it's been 7 years since multithreading was requested but it's still not supported).
 Are features like builtin encryption (previously I have e.g. ext4 on LUKS), deduplication, and snapshoting particularly important for large media files? None of these seem too relevant given I don't change the media files often, just add and delete (though it would be nice to be able to use such files on e.g. text files). More importantly, does the usage require you to be more involved? Nothing beats a single backup (rsync) command and also being able to access the files directly on the filesystem, viewing the contents like any other file. I believe you can mount the filesystems on such software, but on Youtube, everyone seems to always highlight the fact that you can list the files and open them with none showing that you can mount it as a filesystem, which seems to be way more intuitive and useful. 
 Much appreciated. I plan on moving the external HDDs to the Pi and backing up to it to remove clutter from my workspace.

 I've found the link to a youtube video from a long lost banned account.
 When I visit the link it loads the Youtube page and then the video keeps loading, I've seen people say it can take hours before the video has finished loading, so I have it in the background and have my fingers crossed.
 ​
 However... If I try and download the video via https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/ICvB8ptbNEE I get the message :
 "Hrm.
 The Wayback Machine has not archived that URL.
 This page is not available on the web
 because of server error"
 ​
 So, does the video even exist at all? Clearly it is loading something ?
 Link to the snapshot : https://web.archive.org/web/20210204000214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICvB8ptbNEE
 ​
 Link to the download failing : https://web.archive.org/web/2oe_/http://wayback-fakeurl.archive.org/yt/ICvB8ptbNEE

 Thanks in advance.

 I wonder if the projects that we share here would use a platform like https://bookmytime.dev/, would we all see this as beneficial?
 I'm mainly posting this so that the community as well as those contributing to it with their awesome projects will know that this option exists, and that I personally think, given the opportunity - something like this would go a long way.
 Heck, even allowing teams of people to chip in to pay for a developer's time to fix some issue that as a community we would like to see fixed.
 Hope projects here adopt this model (don't care if they use this particular framework, but I do like the model).

So I also have a bunch of unused hard disks. I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to convert the Sans Digital 4 bay eSATA cases to SAS. When I open up one of the Sans Digital cases, I see that there is a single eSATA to SATA cable running to the backplane. There is another ribbon cable for the activity lights and a couple molex connectors to the backplane. 
 Would this be worthwhile or just more trouble than its worth? If so, what are some decent, inexpensive, alternatives for an external 4/8bay SAS enclosures? I have about 20 drives I'd like to repurpose. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I realise this is a bit of a nebulous question on my part (how do I define mostly idle, what other components (e.g. the PSU) does the machine have, what is a non-worry amount of power consumption cost).
 But what I'm really getting at is to get someone's sort of common sense perspective on whether a machine designed to be a gaming rig (circa 2014) could:
  
Make for a sensible home server (e.g. if it's the case that Linux PCs can sip power surprisingly well if not constantly doing active work)
 Or if it's the case that as a rule of thumb machines built to be gaming rigs will still consume an unreasonable amount of power even under idle with a light Linux installation, and it's better to just get something like a NUC.
  
I do have a Pi, and an old laptop, which I use for homelab sort of purposes, but neither can do transcoding well on things like Jellyfin/Plex.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My previous setup is port forwarding a wireguard server to tunnel into my home network, this works because ISP assigns a dynamic public address. Now the ISP doesn't do that anymore, the public IP the router uses is not the actual internet facing IP. There is another router at the ISP level. What do I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I currently have a Plex server running on a mini Windows desktop PC with an i5-8500 CPU and 8 gigs of RAM. It has a 256gb SSD and then all of my media is stored in two external drives of 1TB and 4TB.
 To be honest, this set up has done really well for me and changing it is not 100% necessary. However, 5TB of storage is no longer viable and I need to upgrade. Adding more external drives would be an option, but I don't really like the idea of having a bunch of drives laying around attached to my PC.
 So, I considered buying a hard drive dock, that would allow me to put in multiple drives and plug all into my computer with a single cable. However, at this point, I started to think that maybe it would just be worth it to go all the way and set up a NAS.
 Now, I have no idea on how NAS work other than watching a video or two on the subject. I also do not know what benefits I stand to gain from using one.
 As I said, my setup has worked well in terms of performance (I have at most 3 people watching at once). I do not have any 4k media, nor do I plan on having it anytime soon, but I would like for this to be viable.
 To sum up, I think it all boils down to this question - Do I go the dock route and keep everything simple or go all out and go for a NAS? What benefits does one have over the other? If it helps, my budget for this upgrade sits between 300-500€.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the last few years, I've been using shucked drives and have come up with 2x 4tb hdds, with an additional 1tb nvme boot, 1 nvme gaming and 1 tb sata ssd for gaming as well. I'd like to either consolidate, and update the drives, because at the end of the day, they were of unknown backgrounds and I've started getting some warning signs like explorer freezing when opening text or .rar files.
 I saw a crucial mx500 4tb for $289, but would this be better than a hdd for my purpose? The hdds are to archive steam games mainly, so I won't have to download again, and blu-ray archiving.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I hope someone can help me here. So, I bought a second-hand Fujitsu Primergy RX100 S7 for €100. (It said it was from 2014, but looked brand new.) Now, I got home and tried to fire it up. It loaded into ESXi, but I didn’t have the root password, so I couldn’t log in, or shut down “safely”. I then powered it off by holding the power button, and now I need a password to even startup the server. I can’t enter the BIOS or boot menu. I asked the seller but she said that she didn’t use the server, so she didn’t have any passwords. Now, I can’t do anything with it. I tried default BIOS-passwords; didn’t work. Removing the CMOS-battery for the night; didn’t work. Can someone help me remove this password? Thanks in advance!

 I am a contributor to REI3, a selfhosted low code platform. Its an open source alternative to tools like Ninox, Retool, Mendix and the like.
 Our latest major release just dropped - some highlights:
  
Multi factor authentication
 Major redesign of the application builder user interfaces
 Better form layouts with tabbed fields
 Integrated backups for all types of hosting/systems
  
We´ve been hard at work processing feedback and expanding the capabilities of what you can build with REI3.
 For those new to low code: The idea is that you can create your own custom software without the need for programming. You can create user interfaces, store data, send and process mails, and so on.
 We hope you like the new update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have the following idea for setting up my home network/PCs.
 One last-gen PC with A+ CPU/GPU to be shared among: 
  
Room 1 (2nd floor): Low-latecy audio (DAW) and casual gaming.
 Room 2 (1st floor) : home-teather (main) and casual gaming.
 Potentially other rooms (max 1+).
  
A possibility is to run multiple virtual machines on the main PC (one per room), which is connected over wired LAN. Then, lowest-possible-cost PCs with small form factor (e.g. mini-PCs) located in the different rooms are used to connect to the VMs.
 Ethernet cables are already on place in the house (2 floors). All PCs need to be bought.
 Advantages: 
  
no additional wiring (!) to buy and deploy (such as A/V, USB) like I have seen in similar projects.
 low-latency applications (audio) will be run from Main PC directly (or via VM, but still physically at the main PC).
  
Disadvantages:
  
Round-trip latency to game from Room2 over LAN (reasonable to keep it below 10-15 ms?)
 Keeping costs of mini-PC very low (?) to make the idea meaningful.
 Noise from Main PC (Room1 used for audio recording)
  
Any feedback here would be helpful! Especially on which VM framework to use, and if the whole idea is realistic, of course.

 My thought is that I could put 4 pictures on my flatbed scanner then divide them up once I scan it. Seems like it would be faster than scanning one picture at a time. 
 Has anyone used a flatbed scanner to save old photos? What do you recommend? 
 EDIT: forgot to add.... I would like to buy an external HD to save the photos on. Is there a plug and play HD that I can move from one computer to another if needed? The last one I had many years ago was a major pain to use and required one to use western digital a software and I hated it. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm ready to move beyond exposure and understanding of what I'm working with infrastructure-wise to actually being responsible for buildout and maintenance, and before I start messing with edge technologies for multitenant environments (VRFs, etc.), I'd like to make sure I'm solid with my core virtualization infrastructure from a network perspective.
 I'm doing a hyper-v build soon since I'm more unfamiliar with it vs. vmware, but I'd like to have a pair of switches (stacked would be nice but is not necessary) that helps me understand the concepts that I'd be dealing with on a daily basis in a datacenter environment. I've considered sharing what I've designed so far, but since I'm open to hearing about what I don't know, I'll leave this open to everyone's interpretation and not prejudice your responses. Is anyone able to make a recommendation about where I should be focused, and what networking features (vxlan/varp/vrrp) and architectures (e.g. spine and leaf vs. a more traditional core/distribution/access model) should be interested in familiarizing myself with?
 I'm a quick study generally speaking so if you have thoughts or experience outside of what I've been exposed to, I might have follow-up questions. Either way, I appreciate the input, and believe me, I don't have any preconceptions that this is can be boiled down to a single post. Any and all feedback is appreciated.

So I have 12 SSDs and 6 NVMe drives in a machine with a 10G NIC and a 20 core CPU. note that this is all leftover hardware and pretty overkill for the purpose, but I plan to rebuild a more power-efficient version soon.
 I'm using TrueNAS on bare metal at the moment, and the storage pools are fast, but no docker capability means I have to setup a Linux VM for docker (currently using dietpi). I could also run Proxmox and run both TrueNas and linux in VMs. Or since I don't really need all the features of TrueNAS, I could just run Ubuntu Server and roll my own ZFS.
 What feels cleaner to y'all?

 Microsoft Office alternative (with up to 5 users), similar to what I have with O365 Family - I was thinking of OnlyOffice?
  Cloud Storage: to get away from Google Drive
  Possible separate photo storage: I like the iPhone photos app how it organizes by people/place. Are there any tools like that?
  
I currently have a Raspberry Pi 3 that I’m using to host Home Assistant. I think in order for me to do what I want, I’d need something beefier than that. So am I better off keeping the PI for Home Assistant and hosting everything with like GCP, Digital Ocean, or Linode?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 over the last two-three years I just used duckdns + nginx proxy manager(npm) to expose the Nextcloud and Home Assistant instances on my home server for me and my family. To access all the other services I just used a wireguard connection back home whenever needed.
 Than a good friend asked if he could have access to my audiobookshelf(abs) and I opened up that too. After that more services got exposed for other friends too. (Till I hit the duckdns limit) So I decided to separate things again, and got a oracle free tier VPS and bought an domain last week. 
 On the VPS I installed npm and opened up the ports it needed to work. And here comes the first question. What's the best practice to deal with the port for the UI? Right now I block the port and whenever something needs to be done on the UI I open up the port in Oracle. So the connection to the UI during the changes is always unsecure. Maybe there are even better ways than using npm?
 After that I spinned up the docker container and added the subdomains for them to cloudflare. Where my second question evolved. When proxying traffic through cloudflare I am using their bandwidth are there any limitations regarding traffic? Would it be better to disable the proxy and just use it as a DNS? Now regarding SSL. I set the SSL to "Full (strict)" got one *.mydomain.xyz let's encrypt certificate with a DNS challenge in npm. But somehow the cloudflare certificate is being used instead the let's encrypt one. And assigned the wildcard cert to the proxies in npm. Everything works but I am not sure if it the correct way to set it up.
 So the public facing apps are now on oracle servers and I am now only my family is using my server back home.
 Any suggestions to improve things to be more secure? Maybe other suggestions too.
 Thanks for your time
 Cheers

 Recently, Nintendo started unlisting some of their other pages. I worry that these interviews are at risk.
 The site consists of a series of static pages that are all linking to each other, like a mini encyclopedia.
 I tried backing them up before, but I am not good enough at scripting to pull it off.
 Would really love it if someone could do this and maybe end up with a folder with all the htmls in there.

 My current server is an old desktop PC with an i7 4770k and 16GB of RAM, all in a Fractal Design R5 case and no graphics card. It was at first a gaming PC with the CPU overclocked, then it has been has been running 24/7 for almost 7 years as server and I have never had a single problem, I really appreciate this machine for its reliability. However, with time the electricity bill increases because of the important consumption of the CPU.
 My server uses Proxmox as a hypervisor and runs mainly:
  
x2 LXC Container (Pi-Hole & Minecraft Server)
 x4 VM: 
 Home Assistant
 Jellyfin
 Reverse Proxy
 Alpine Linux with docker to manage the rest of my services like nextcloud, bitwarden, miniflux, etc...
 
  
I'm looking to replace it all with a server that takes up less space and consumes less power.
 I also think to replace Proxmox by Fedora Server or Fedora CoreOS to use only containers with podman.
 I have two machines that hold my attention,
 The first one is the Lenovo ThinCenter M70q gen3 with an i5 and 16gb of ram, this product interests me a lot, but what I don't know is the noise pollution, my current server has a noctua ventirad and the Define R5 is totally silent, and I would like this little box to be as much.
 Second would be an Intel NUC 12 with i5 and 16GB of RAM. I'm less convinced because I'm not sure that this hardware is as reliable over time and may lack performance for some tasks, but it is probably the best for power consumption and noise.
 I'm also hesitating with the i3 model, I intend to get one or two more in the near future to make a cluster.
 Would you have an opinion on these two machines or others to recommend? 
 I thought about the Dell Optiplex but in France they are sold with a Windows license, which means an extra cost.
 Thanks,

I intend on only ripping non-UHD disks for the forseeable future. Do I need to flash the drive anyways, or is that only for ripping UHD?
 I saw that I could use an LG WH14NS40 or LG WH16NS40. I would need an enclosure. Would buying them straight from Amazon be an okay method?

 I am considering getting one of the TrueNAS systems, but that's a big splurge. $1000+ and that's not even including the cost of the drives themselves.
 I have seen on PC Part Picker that I can get ECC compatible processors in the $50 range, but the motherboards are in the $500 range (yikes). Still better than buying a TrueNAS machine, but once I've bought all the other parts (RAM, power supply, graphics card, case) I could see it being closer in price to the expensive TruaNAS.
 I think I've discovered a good option. On both Amazon and eBay are a lot of refurbished Dell and HP Xeon desktops. They vary in price from $100-500. The Xeon…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The situation is simple: I have a Proxmox node, and I want to spin up a few Debian or Alpine Linux VMs automatically using declarative configuration, and get to the point where I can run Ansible playbooks on them. I think Terraform would be good for creating VMs.
 I was originally going to build some images using debootstrap or Alpine's equivalent, customize the images a bit and upload them, but it seems like the Proxmox Terraform provider doesn't support that method. That means I have to use either PXE, cloud-init, or preprovision. Preprovision only supports Ubuntu and CentOS, so that's an instant dealbreaker.
 I looked around for some posts about cloud-init, and they seem kind of split on whether it's useful or not. Some people mentioned:
  
Ansible can do everything it can
 Hypervisors usually have templating features already
 cloud-init is for datacenters and you should use Packer and PXE boot
  
PXE boot sounds complicated to set up. Do you think cloud-init is good for this usecase?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been data hoarding for about a year now. I've bought several external hard drives ranging from 1TB-5TB to store everything (Seagate and WD). I didn't have too much data at first, and I like how they are portable and easy to plug and play on other devices.
 My question is, would it be more cost effective to buy internal hard drives like 3.5" NAS HDDs and buy a cheap enclosure to go with it? For example I've seen 10TB+ Internal Drives sell for cheaper than pre-enclosed external ones, but I dont know if I would need an extra power source other then the USB plug that comes with a portable enclosure. I also wouldn't be opposed to go with a smaller drive if the extra power is needed on larger drives.
 I am no where near setting up a home server or using a cloud based system, just looking to plug into the TV through USB for now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First, I would like to apologize for the wall of text below. It's tough to digest since English is not my native language.
 Using YouTube to store videos: I have done my homework and agree with the consensus. This is a bad idea. A significant risk of a ban at any moment without ever getting a chance to appeal or interact with a human being, let alone a chance to recover the data, a significant drop in quality across the board, the sudden apparition of exotic formats compatible with nothing, it goes on and on. Some have tried and are here to tell their horror stories on this sub.

 For reference my main rig is a white box dual Xeon E5-2698 V4 / 256 GB Ram / dual 10g NICs/ 1660 Ti for transcoding - on proxmox. Running about 7 VMs and 25 containers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellas, I have a few channels I scrape occasionally on Bitchute using a custom script I wrote and using yt-dlp. I've noticed that a lot of older videos no longer archive, and when I check the videos on Bitchute they no longer load - so it's not an issue with my script or yt-dlp. The latest channel I tried to archive cut off at a video on December 3, 2019 - and all videos older than that are no longer playing on the website. 
 Is this an issue with Bitchute automatically no longer hosting videos once they've been uploaded for a certain amount of time? Anyone else run into this problem? Any input is helpful. Thanks guys.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 Please share with me some ideas on how to tackle this.
 I woud like to auto-upload Blueiris JPEGs to Mega as they are being created. I would also like to monitor the space available and delete the oldest so that I can stay under my 20GB max.
 Requirements:
  
Upload JPEGs in real-time (5 second delay max)
 Be aware of max storage cap and auto-delete the oldest
 Encrypt on the fly
 
I'm not married to Mega so I'm happy to use other options with 15+ GB of free storage 
 No Google Drive 
 Protocol/platform is flexible (SFTP and Object Storage is fine too)
 
 Host machine is capped at 10GB while remote will have 20GB, so host machine will delete oldest before remote
  
​
 I know that I can do this with Rclone with some scripting, but I wanted to know if there was other better options. Ex: Restic? duplicity? borg? Rsync? I haven't used these myself. Thank you for your help!

 Everything under eth1 is what I'd want to achieve rather than the setup I have right now.
 My goal is to have multiple separate subnets which would contain virtual machines that are capable of reaching other machines within the subnet, but not the machines in other subnets, or machines within my LAN (192.168.0.0/24). Simultaneously, I want machines inside the subnets to be resolvable and reachable by external (outside of LAN) clients.
 My experience with networking is limited to esxi, and networking stack of linux is somewhat alien to me, so I would appreciate if not a fully detailed guide on how to achieve my goal, then at least a few helpful pointers on how I can do that with the tools that proxmox provides (that being, the entirety of Linux's networking stack). Thanks!

However, take 5 pages from 10 different websites, comeback in 3 months and you will quickly realize half the links are broken, content has changed or has been completely lost. Everyday thousands of new websites are created and shut down.

 Currently I use Dashlane as my password manager and I’m thinking of moving to a self hosted solution since I’ve just got my homelab setup. I know a lot of people have been recommending bitwarden and have a few questions before I move over:
  
Does it require much maintenance? I.e management of database, fixing errors and updates?
 
Does Bitwarden support MFA? In addition to being a password manager I’d like my self hosted solution to support MFA codes built into the app.
 
Does Bitwarden have an addon for Brave which autofills login forms automatically? Say I’m on twitter.com will it recognise the website and fill in the password automatically?
 
Can Bitwarden run in docker?
 
In general what issues have people faced with Bitwarden and is there anything I need to be aware of when setting it up/using it?
 
 Thanks in advance!!🙂

 Hello
 I wanna buy a new HDD, im choosing between:
 ​
 Toshiba P300 6TB (HDWD260UZSVA)
 and
 Seagate BarraCuda 6TB ( ST6000DM003)
 ​
 In the shop in my country, in my language (not english) it says for Toshiba: "MTBF 600000 hours" and for Seagate: "Reliability 300000 cycles".
 ​
 Is "MTBF" (Mean time Before Failure) the same as "Reliability Cycles"...? I did the translation from my language to english as good as i can.
 Are they the same?
 If not, which one is Better?
 ​
 600 000 Hours MTBF
 or
 300 000 Reliability Cycles?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've browsed this subreddit and others quite a bit on this topic, but I'm in search of a few specific things and it's pretty time-consuming trying out different options, I'm hoping someone with experience can help. I've been running both my music and ebook libraries from my desktop and I'd like to move them to my home server.
 Music: currently I'm running MediaMonkey on my desktop, adding specific songs to a "Phone" playlist to sync with my Android via MediaMonkey's app. This works okay but it'd be nice to be able to access my large library remotely when I'm on wifi and not be reliant on sitting at my desktop for adding new songs to my phone.
 Features: 
  
able to stream library from my local desktop 
 able to download select songs/albums/artists to my Android for playing remotely without data
 also be able to stream songs to my Android when on wifi (remotely)
 95% of my music listening is from my phone with no data available, and my full library is enormous - so it'd be nice if most of the time only the downloaded songs are shown so that I don't need to sift through the rest of my unavailable library 
  
A Jellyfin server + S2 android app seems like a good option here - but I haven't had a chance to test this combo out yet.
 Books: currently I have Calibre on my desktop and upload books to BookFusion for reading via Android and web. BookFusion is great but I'd like something selfhosted and not limited to X books in my library. 
 Features: 
  
accessible via Android app, which allows downloading for reading offline
 accessible via web 
 syncs/remembers progress between platforms
 allows annotations (highlighting and notes) with the ability to export them 
  
If I can't find something selfhosted I'll probably switch to Google Play Books.
 Thanks for any help you can provide - and thanks for all the help this subreddit has already given, it's been a great resource as I've built up my home server.

 I've been running my own media stack, at first in an LXC, but after a mishap with kernel update on the host machine and data being corrupted I've decided to migrate all of it into a VM
 And now I'm seeing massive usage in terms of ram, basically it'll eat up everything no matter what I'll throw at it.
 I've gathered some initial investigation data here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1juwCpedw5cn2c_2mA944Lt6hfw3uF6Dp7bAWR5Dpl30/edit?usp=sharing
 I'll be updating the docs as we go, but I'll really appreciate some help here as now it results in jellyfin running like shit unfortunately :/

 I'm trying to use ipmitool over my home LAN (no specific network configuration, no firewall, no VLAN) on my Dell PowerEdge R720 (running VMware ESXi 7.0) but I can't get it to work. What's really weird is that its configuration is identical to my other Dell PowerEdge server (which is an R720XD), for which it works... Here is my iDRAC network configuration :
 https://preview.redd.it/y3zginenpf9a1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0dfaab9e50e15d5b38696f9cfec3474c52f8d2f
 Here is the command I try to run as a test :
  ipmitool -I lanplus -H 192.168.1.190 -U root -P PASSWORD sdr elist all 
 And the error message I get :
  
Error: Unable to establish IPMI v2 / RMCP+ session
  
Any idea ? 🤔

 However, I've been having a bit of an issue. I can't seem to figure out how to pass group information to the application through OAuth. Some applications don't support LDAP, so it's not an option for me to use it to get permissions through groups. I'm trying to decide whether I should use LDAP as much as possible to get permissions through groups, or if I should consider every user a regular user and use application-specific local admin accounts. 
 Any advice on this would be appreciated. Thanks!

 1) Do any of you use compression, in any form, for either backups, local storage, or cloud?
 Files I'm considering compressing:
 2) I have a LOT of games downloaded, which I do not currently play, but plan on returning to. One example would me Skyrim +150 Mods, which took weeks to figure out the right combination of mods

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got lots of valuable input regarding exposing some of my services here and i am experimenting with some of the approaches now.
 One of the things i want to set up is proper monitoring. All my services are behind a Traefik Reverse Proxy. I would like to avoid going through the access log every now and then and manually check it and instead have some kind of dashboard. The following metrics are something i would be interested in:
  
CrowdSec/Fail2ban metrics (number of blocked requests / banned IPs, ...)
 Number of requests grouped by return code, endpoint , ...
 IP geolocations
 ...
  
I was thinking about the ELK stack, however it seems to be quite heavy for a small homeserver. As far as i am aware a slightly more lightweight solution would be Promtail + Loki + Grafana. However i couldn't really find a lot of information/guides on how to use this stack in combination with Traefik/Fail2ban/CrowdSec to setup a monitoring dashboard.
 Another project i've found is GoAccess, which ticks many of the boxes, but i'm not quite sure how to integrate CrowdSec and Fail2ban metrics (or if it's possible at all).
 Whats your setup when it comes to monitoring your exposed services and trying to detect the worst case of an successful attack?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've written something to scratch a personal itch, and it might perhaps be useful to others since there doesn't seem to be anything else available to do it.
 It allows you to cast audio from the YouTube app on Android (and I presume iOS too) to a DLNA renderer (wifi speaker, streaming receiver etc.).
 You run it on any device on your network and each renderer you have will show up in the Cast menu in the app.
 Pause, play, stop and volume controls in the app are mapped through to the renderer. (Seek doesn't work. Maybe I'll fix it one day.)
 It's pretty basic but I find it very useful. I hope others may get some use out of it - let me know if you do, and/or if you hit problems. It hasn't had a great deal of long-term testing - at the moment I just run it up (on Ubuntu 22.04) when I need it. It's also the first real thing I've written in Javascript so there could well be rookie mistakes.
 It's called upnpTube.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I built haystack - natural language search engine for workplace technical knowledge.
 My name is Yuval I've been a software engineer for a few years now,
 A few weeks ago I was scrolling through confluence pages trying to find ssh connection details to our jenkins second integration machine for 40 minutes straight, later I discovered my co-worker slack'ed me the ssh connection string two months ago.
 A week later I started working on haystack - a search engine for workplace apps.. It enables you to search slack, confluence, jira, teams, jfrog, github, and email in one place.
 It supports natural language queries so a query like: "how to connect to integ2 machine?" yields:
 ssh -i private.pem ubuntu@ec2-integration2.eu-est-1.compute.amazonaws.com 
 Privacy?
 haystack is self hosted and stores user data locally, and is totally client-side - only you have access to internal docs, I didn't want to deal with security compliance headaches caused from storing user data in the cloud + I don’t want your internal docs/messages.
 Rolled it out to my co-workers a week ago and they thought it's a hit, so I'm planning on releasing it publicly on March 2023.
 Early access
 If you want to try it out before March 2023 - Available here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was researching NAS options and came across an offer for cloud storage priced at $1200 for 10TB lifetime. One time payment. By comparison that cost will get you 2 years of Google Drive storage. Based on that alone it looks like a win but what other factors do you consider when gauging the cost of data storage. I'm not talking about the pros and cons of cloud vs. local storage. I already get that. I'm asking, IF cloud storage could work for you, how valuable will 10TB be in 5, 10, 20 years. As media file sizes get bigger with 8K and photos grow in megapixels, will 10TB in the future get you what 500GB gets you today? Will the failure rate of NAS drives become a non issue when pricing storage? I have no use for 10TB of cloud storage now but down the line I probably will. If so, is this deal worth it?

 ​
 Does this section ever actually change?
 === START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
 SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
 My current plan is to run short tests once a week and check that passed. I know this will mean not paying attention to things like increasing read or write errors but seems to be something I can reasonably automate.
 In more detail I'll be looking at:
 smartctl -j -a /dev/sda|jq .smart_status
 {
 "passed": true
 }

 Anyone have any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow Hoarders,
 A couple of year-ish back, the WD Blue SN550 with the go-to, with a nice fast 1.2TB or so per second write, and sustaining a respectable 850MBps post cache.
 Ever since the chip swap in 2021, it remains fast (faster, in fact) for the SLC portion, then drops to 370MBps. Not acceptable.
 Does anyone know who the budget king of NVME currently is?
 I'm really only looking for one key feature:
 sustained writes that are notably faster than SATA, after cache is exhausted
 750MB-1000MB would be nice. Price is a key factor.
 Thanks all!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello.
 i have not previously owned a multi monitor setup, but i really need one. and im going to do that but several challenges and questions lay ahead.
 firstly i own an AMD card, i wanted to know how it actualy is if you try to connect a few monitors to 1 GPU and a couple more to another GPU (of same gpu model) i have heard and seen very conflicting info from different sources, some say it works very good, some say it doesn't, some says it works but can be challenging to work with. what is the truth?
 also my budget is limited, the more monitors the better for my usecase. but i also want to have a stable setup, i want to use my budget as wisely as possible so i can have more left over for other things for my computer setup. so my question is, if i buy a very good monitor for the main one, and then buy multiple of a worse less resolution or size (or even a different brand) monitors, will that create chalanges and mess up the UX in any ways? will it create confusion for the PC when moving the mouse between different res screens because of different positioning? also how will it work both in linux and windows because i use both?
 and lastly if i try to connect my display port monitors to DP, and at same time connect more HDMI monitors using a hdmi>DP adapter to the display ports on the GPU will it create complications or DeSync of latency between displays?
 my overall goal and view is that i want my set up to be just as plug and play as if i had all the same monitors all with DP, and also get as many monitors as possible while trying to save money.
 thank you.

 Is this something to be concerned about? It only sometimes makes this louder version of what would be considered normal hard drive noises when reading/writing to it. You can even hear at the end of the video it quiets down and returns to normal. The disk passed a SMART test and there's no values in the SMART output that would indicate any kind of failure or damage.

 Do you have a set of containers you manually update, and others you auto update?
  
Right now, I manually update containers as I see fit (or when I can be bothered), however, I'm going to spend some time automating this over the next few days and wanted to get a feel for what others are doing.

 I am trying to get NUT working correctly on a setup I am attempting to...setup.
  
 The issue I am having is that none of the devices connected to the NUT server are doing what they are told.
 For example, I have set (on a test system), that particular system to shutdown when the battery gets to 99%, and a second test system set to shutdown at 90%.
  
 If I remove the power (other than this brand new UPS immediately dropping to 80%!!!) neither system shuts down, but does immediately receive a syslog message about the UPS being on battery.
 Now, I am not confident i have my configs setup correctly.
  
 Config wise -

But one of the things I really like about my Synology is that I can hot swap the drives and if the drives fail there are lights on the front and the system beeps.
 That got me wondering if there are hard drives enclosures for multiple drives that would provide the hot swap capability and visual notifications. A quick search either found NAS system or small 4 bay enclosures.
 Suggestions please

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to follow this guide to better protect my network while running some game servers on my Dell T440 for our Discord server. 
 Guide: https://www.howtogeek.com/440752/protect-your-home-minecraft-server-from-ddos-attacks-with-aws/
 I've gotten most of the way through without issue until it comes to configuring SSLH. Not only is the config file not in the location as stated in the guide it seems to be missing quite a few lines towards the end of the file. 
 I found a thread where someone else had the same issue, but the fix in this thread doesn't work for me either. https://forum.level1techs.com/t/configure-sslh/151892/13 
 Both the guide and thread could be outdated, or I could still just be screwing it up, but I'm unsure of what to try next. 
 I have set the AWS port forward settings as "Inbound, custom UDP, Range: 16261-16262, Source 0.0.0.0/0. (Note: For some reason when I added the port rules for the game it blocked me out of SSH until I added another rule to allow my home IP to connect via port 22. Idk if I did something wrong here as well.)
 Should I keep at this method or is there a better way? Thanks in advance!

 (Server: Dell T440, Proxmox VE, VM: LinuxGSM.)
 (Note: The game server is working just using my public IP)

I’ve started to corral them in one place to weed out duplicates and keep the best versions, but I’m stuck on one thing. How do I download things I’ve purchased from various sites that are hosted on those sites and not my device. For example, I buy audiobooks from Chirp. I can listen to them using their app, but I want to get them saved so I can listen to them even if I don’t have an internet connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I receive a few different periodic emails that I would like to use as input to automations like downloading data provided in a link in the email, or adding a newsletter to my wallabag.
 I could (but would rather not) write a python script to poll my actual email account, but I'd rather find free email account that I can automatically forward the emails to and then pull from that, then run an automation for each new email that comes in. There must be a solution out there already, how are people getting this done? I don't want to run an email server myself, that's a whole can of worms I don't want to deal with, and I don't need to be event-based; polling a couple times a day would be enough.
 I did a bit of searching here and /r/selfhosted, but mostly people are talking about syncing/archiving emails, which is not what I'm trying to solve; as soon as I grab the input and launch the automation I'll trash the email.

 I am new to networking so i need some advice currently i have a vps in which has tailscale vpn and is in locked down state by following this guide, thus i can ssh only when i am connected to vpn but if i host uptimekuma using docker i am able to access it via vpsip:port combo (ex 10.10.10.10:999) is there any way for me to block this from happening, apart from this i also want cloudflare tunnel to tunnel my uptimekuma instance to my subdomain which will be public is this doable??
 Note- both cloudflared and tailsale are installed in baremetal
 my current ufw status is 
 ``` Status: active Logging: on (low) Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed) New profiles: skip
 To Action From
  
Anywhere on tailscale0 ALLOW IN Anywhere
 Anywhere (v6) on tailscale0 ALLOW IN Anywhere (v6)
 ``` What i have tried so far 
 1- tried blocking all outgoing connection (this results in me unable t login to vps even after connecting to vpn had to manually deny it using hoster's web console )
 2- tried to host cloudflared and uptime kuma in same network but this also not works described in this post
 Am currently lost

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jesus! I have several Seagate Barracuda drives - ST2000DM001-1ER164. Granted I've had them a few years now but all have started to fail. The first that failed was in my dad's PC. Then suddenly I turned my PC on one day, that had 3 of them in and although working the day before just fine, one of them failed. So it was time to backup the rest. I purchased Hard Disk Sentinel and checked the remaining drives. All fine. I turn the PC on today and check out qtorrent for some ongoing archive downloads and it keeps freezing. Odd, seems to be doing it on just one torrent so I'm trying to delete but can't.
 I realise something similar was happening when one died early in the year so run Hard Disk Sentinel and it flags the drive health at 26%. JESUS! I've only copied 2 new folders to it recently so back those up. There is another one in the machine still showing 100% heath but Jesus they have been poor. All purchased round the same time roughly, all dying roughly round the same time!
 Never buying Seagate again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, all! 
 I'd like to 'burn in' my RAID for several hours (or days) before I start to copy data over. I'm still new to all this, but had a blast setting up my first NAS server with a 24TB RAID (4x8TB RAID-Z) on TrueNAS Scale. This will eventually be a media server. 
 One of the reasons why I want to burn-in at the RIAD level, rather than the disk level (e.g. SMART test or badblocks), is because I'm concerned about my PSUs ability to power multiple drives running simultaneously. All of my issues over the last few weeks have been when the disks passed both SMART and badblocks, but the RAID failed over and over. I followed advice online and since upgraded my PSU and power cables. 
 I had the idea that I could just torrent a massive amount of data for a week. This would effectively stress the I/O in proportion to its anticipated use. Is there a free torrent that would accomplish this? I don't want to sign up for any sites where maintaining a ratio is a concern: If the RAID fails, I'd like to be able to repeat the test. 
 I'm open to other suggestions as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our research group has about 150TB of data we're currently storing with some cloud service that's costing us a lot monthly. We also have a new project starting in 2025 which will generate a similar amount of data. I've been tasked with building a file server to be housed somewhere on campus to hold this data.
 Data access pattern:
  
Copy a 500GB chunk of data to the campus compute cluster (about 1h transfer time at 1Gb/s)
 Do some computation on the cluster over this 500GB of data (takes about 30h)
 Delete the 500GB chunk from the cluster and move on to the next chunk
  
Purchase list:
  
Data hosting ($12000)
  
45Drives Storinator Q30 ($7000)
 14x 16TB Seagate Exos drives w/ RAID-Z2 ($5000)
 
 
Data backup ($5750)
  
Symplypro SYPRO-DT3L8H1B-A0 desktop tape drive ($5000)
 14x 12TB HPE LTO-8 tapes ($750)
 
  
I've left half the drive bays empty for building another array a few years from now.
 Questions:
  
Approximately what's the likelihood that a drive will fail in 5 years?
 How complex is the replacement? I may not always be around to fix the server
 About how long would a rebuild take if a drive fails, and is double-parity enough to prevent another drive from failing during this time?

 Goals
  
Run a web scraping bot I wrote
 Run another web-oriented bot
 Be a development environment for Haskell, whose compiler loves RAM and CPU power
 Eventually be a NAS
 Have some room to do more stuff as I think of it!
  
Parts
  
 Part Model Link 
  
 CPU Ryzen 7 3700X (8 core, 16 threads) Link 
  CPU Cooler Wraith Prism (stock with CPU)  
  Motherboard ASUS PRIME B550M-A/CSM Link 
  RAM Corsair 32 GB module Link 
  Gfx Card ATI Radeon HD 3470 (lol) Link 
  Case Thermaltake Core V21 Link 
  PSU Thermaltake Smart 500W Link 
  SSD TeamGroup 1TB PCIe 3.0 Link 
 
 Comments
  
I'm so excited about this! I haven't built a PC since I was a kid and it's so much fun
 The plan is to run Proxmox and have VMs for the different bots / environments
 I love the idea of having 16 threads to work with for different VMs
 I started with a single 32 GB RAM module so I can add more if I need/want
 It's a "gaming" motherboard, but it's a nice price and I think it'll work. I didn't see many better options.
 The cube case is the only thing fits in my home lab cabinet. Unfortunately I don't have space for a server rack
 No built-in graphics with the Ryzen CPU, but you can get a really old card for $9 on ebay!
 Cost pre-tax and pre-shipping is ~ $500
  
Questions
  
 How is this build for power usage? Anything I can or should do to reduce it?
  I eventually want to get a couple 2TB HDDs and use this as a NAS. I was thinking ZFS mirroring for them. I also have a brand new 2.5in 500GB SSD lying around, could that be involved? What's the best setup in Proxmox?
  I assume that I'll have to get out a USB drive to update the motherboard BIOS from time to time, is that right?
 Anything else about this setup you think I should know or look into?
  
Thanks! 😁

 I have a 2-disk synology, each has 2TB disk. My usage is to store mp3, movie. and if data is lost I am Ok.
 I'd like to leverage full capacity of total 4 TB disk and don't want to go with SHR.
 if one disk fail, I hope the data on another disk survive.
 should I
 option 1: create "basic" raid type, and create 2 storage pool (each has 1 volume, pointing to one of the disk), or
 option 2: 1 storage pool with 2 volume?
 I am open to other options. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Looking for some monitoring software that keeps track of any changes of my file that I want to back up. My most important files are the irreplaceable home videos and pictures for the last 25 years or so. I have multiple backups of these and keep them up-to-date, doing a full new backup every now and then. 
 Was just doing a new full backup today and it occurred to me that what if something happens to the original files, like some file accidentally deleted or corrupted. I might notice it years later (or maybe never). When doing new full backups, said files would be eventually lost. 
 I know file versioning would be an option, but eventually that will hit a wall over the years and doesn't really help if I don't notice the changes and make a new full back up.
 So basically I want to have some kind of monitoring software that looks for changes and integrity in the background and informs me of any changes that happen. 
 Something light, easy to use and of course free would be nice. ;)

 I dont want to use wireguard directly because chromecast wouldn't work that way. Also every user would need wireguard installed on their devices.

It essentially indexes every webpage you want and adds it to your own search index, which you can then search using full-text search. No tag management, no summary or title management needed. 
 As I do not want to depend on a third party service for keeping all my bookmarks, as I never could be safe, they are not just closing doors one day, I al searching for a self hosted solution, to do something like this.
 Does anyone know a simple service, I could spawn locally in my home network (I don’t need access outside of it), to archive the same. All my internet searches on this unfortunately did not yield any results.

 The only way I can see so far is to directly edit the docker-compose file, which is discouraged in the documentation. I can't even create a docker-compose.override.yml file becuase for some reason, override files in docker compose don't actually override arrays (https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/3729), so I can't remove the entries already present in the "ports" list for the nginx-mailcow service!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure how relevant those drives are to big data hoarders considering that they are NVME SSDs topping out at 2TB, however I was having a look at the data sheet looking at their endurance and there seems to be two different hardware revisions currently in circulation with way different endurance.
 The earlier/older Firecuda 520 drives had ZP2000GM30002, ZP1000GM30002, ZP500GM30002 product codes and used to have an endurance of 3600TBW, 1800TBW and 850TBW respectively. As far as I am aware these drives used to use Toshiba Bics Flash.
 Meanwhile, if you browse the data sheet of the current Firecuda 520 drives page on Seagate's website, these drives now carry the ZP2000GV3A012, ZP1000GV3A012 and ZP500GV3A012 product codes with an endurance of 1200TBW, 600TBW and 300TBW respectively.
 It also seems to me like the new "Firecuda 520" drives have a different packaging, and a different label on the drives itself with a white notch and line on top right corner of the label while the older version with much higher endurance have a thick orange line at the bottom of the label with "520 series PCIe Gen4 SSD" written on it instead.
 Here are the two PDFs / data sheets on Seagate's website :
 Older revision with Toshiba NAND and higher endurance : DATA SHEET (seagate.com)
 Newer revision with lower endurance : Upgrade Your Gaming Experience (seagate.com)
 Not sure how relevant this is to you data hoarders considering the rather low capacity of the drives, but I thought that this might be an interesting piece of information nonetheless.
 How common is it for drive manufacturers to sneakily revise and change the hardware on their drives while selling them under the same name ? I vaguely remember that happening a couple of years ago with a couple of manufactures such as Adata, Crucial, WD or even Samsung.
 I might cross-post this to the hardware subreddit if there is any interest in that discussion and if I manage to figure out how to do so.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, let me tell you that I am not a Data Hoarder, but I thought this question was probably suited best for this community.
 I want to get a fat-ass hard drive (>10TB) so I can keep a full backup of my Steam account, just in case, something happens to steam. The hard drive would sit inside of my computer case, and it will be connected as a separated drive in my computer.
 However I have heard that large hdd are (very) noisy. which makes sense, if they are thought to be in a data center and not inside of a personal computer.
 Do you have any additional information, on how loud they are, which one are best, what is a good Tb/$ price?
 Also, maybe there is another cheaper solution that I have not considered?
 ​
 The HDD that I have in mind is this one: https://www.cclonline.com/st16000nm000j-seagate-exos-x18-16tb-sata-iii-3-5-hard-drive-7200rpm-256mb-384942/
 ​
 PS: In principle it would be only one given the steep price. Might need to add a second backup eventually.

 Got a newbie question about media management and hard links.
 Stack: Sonarr, Radarr, Jackett, qBittorrent
 I've got Sonarr/Radarr working with Jackett and qBittorrent. Hardlinks are working fine between qBittorrent's download folder and Sonarr/Radarr root folder. 
 My question is, am I suppose to periodically clean up the qBittorrent's download folder and leaving the other copies in Sonarr/Radarr?

Since the format has been deprecated as of 2018, and with (what I assume is) the progression of web browsers, the few I have no longer "play" in Apple Music or as HTML content. But it was really good and informative content when used well by the studios. 
 I've tried to find an archive of these but so far been unsuccessful. Anyone save and archive ITLP content (not the music, just the .itlp media directories for albums where they were available via iTunes)?

 I have approx 1.5TB in my Google Drive (Workspace, single-user) I’d like to transfer over to Backblaze. I’m trying to work out all possible options, but looking for some advice ideally from someone who’s done this/something similar before
 Option 1 Download all data From Google Drive onto home server, then upload to Backblaze. No cost involved but with 10mb/s upload speed will take a long time
 Option 2 Spin up VPS on AWS EC2, rclone copy from google drive to B2. Not an expert on rclone, would I have to assign 1.5TBs EBS storage to the VPS to complete the sync? Will also get hammered on ingress/egress charge
 Option 3 Multcloud/Cloudfuze. Waiting to hear on a quote from Multcloud, and Cloudfuze do not support Backblaze (despite it being S3 compatible…)

The first disk in my pool (4TB) is at 99% capacity but all of the other disks read as 0%. For some reason it appears as though everything is saving to just the 4TB disk and then making the entire MergerFS pool appear to be "full". Any help or suggestions?

 I’ve recently gotten my hands on an X13SAE-F and some other hardware to build a homelab system. I installed a i3-12100 (using to update BIOS to support 13th gen) and Micron 32 GB ECC Udimm (MTC20C2085S1EC48BA1R). However, the board will not post and has error beeps (I believe its two short beeps and one long beep). I don’t see this error beep code in the appendix I am thinking that maybe the Micron ram is not supported and I need to order the Supermicro UDIMMs when they come in stock, but maybe the issue is something else
 Here is a video of the beep and memory (I currently have one out of two sticks installed since I was swapping them around to see if it would fix it) https://imgur.com/a/rkUtgMT
 And by no posting I mean theres no HDMI output. by the beeps im assuming its not posting but Im a total supermicro noob so…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I had an Iomega NAS from 2011 but the fan failed last year. I changed them 2 times but the new fans don't last (it's the same ID model but they doesn't work the same). I would like to salvage my 2tb drive and put it in another enclosure, I can format the drive to another file allocation table as I can still access files and move them on my current USB drives. I don't need raid or any server capacities, I just want the HDD available over my network. Only important stuff are pictures but those are backup in 3 places in 3 different spaces (2 USB drives + Cloud). My main usage is purely ease of use for my family; instead moving files around over USB drive, I prefer to have a single network IP that every device can access via SMB. Thanks a lot for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! ... 
 I'm in the process of upgrading my home network and I need to build a NAS. 
 From the research I've been doing on different NAS drives, it seems the common sentiment is that they're noisy for a Home Lab. 
 My 24U rack sits next to my desk where I do most of my work, it's within arms reach, do you think NAS drives will be too noisy for that situation, and if so, would any of you know any alternatives I could use? 
 I really only need 10 or so Terabytes, so just a few 4TB drives or even 2TB drives would be fine. 
 I thought about going with SSD's, but would be pretty expensive for large storage amounts, and I've heard that regular HDD's probably wouldn't last very long. This won't be a very heavily used NAS, just used for storage and only really accessed a few times a day. 
 Also, as a sidenote, I'm also upgrading the internal network to 10g so the faster the NAS the better, I'm mostly using it for storing video and music recordings. 
 Anybody have any drive suggestions I could look at?

 Requirements are simply:
  
ECC RAM
 At least 3 SATA ports
  
Not looking for rack-mountable. I'm aiming for as close to $500 as possible (before the cost of drives). Is there anything modern like those N40L servers?
 All the current-gen microservers are at least $900 and more like $2500. I considered the Dell T40 but it only includes one hard drive bay despite having more than one SATA port...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! 
 I'm looking to add a managed switch behind my pfSense router in order to separate LANs. 
 My pfSense runs on a m720q from Lenovo within Proxmox. My m720q has 3 NICs. One for Proxmox (might change since i'm currently in a double NAT configuration), one for pfSense WAN, one for pfSense LAN. No SR-IOV on my NICs but i'm not sure that would benefit me anyway. 
 I think the best solution would be to add a managed switch behind my pfSense LAN NIC. This managed switch would provide at least three VLANs, one for my NAS / homelab gear, one for private network (NICs in walls in every room, wifi AP), and one for smart home devices. 
 I've read that this sub doesn't like consumer grade gear and prefer used entreprise gear. I agree with that but couldn't fit a whole 19" switch, since I'm building my homelab within a small furniture, which max width is about 12" (30cm).
 From here do you know about an afordable new / refurbished / used model that would fit my need ? I tend to like Tp Link and Mikrotik as they seem to have good overall value. 
 MIKROTIK RB260GS looks like a good solution, what do you think ? 
 Thanks a lot !

 I've seen some answers that some M.2 drives work but not others but no answer on a ssd. I also see some saying the drive will show up but not work as a boot drive. I guess that's not a big deal if it won't work as a boot as I still get to keep the same amount of drives but just not sure if this adventure is worth the time and money to figure out if it will work.

I want to upgrade because I'm now on a 1000/20 connection, and it seems like my current router can't handle it. Currently I've got my eyes set on the RB4011 from MicroTik, but I'm not sure if that will be the best choice. 
 I don't have any spare PCs lying around, and the RB4011 seemed to be cheaper than rolling my own solution. However, I wanted to get some second opinions as well as look around and research before I make my purchase. 
 Things I want my router to do:
 - WireGuard
 -DHCP Leasing
 -Basic Firewall rules and NAT
 -As mentioned earlier, Gigabit throughput 
 -Not necessarily dead quiet, but not loud enough to be annoying
 Thanks for any useful information or advice.

Here's what I'd like to use the new server for:
 1) primary NAS for my Plex media with 8-12 drives for storage.
 2) Hypervisor for not only the VMs that I mentioned above, but also for a couple of windows VMs for various things, and maybe even a hackintosh vm.
 3) Run a web server. This can be done on one of the VMs mentioned above though...
 I've had my eye on a Dell r720 with 8 LFF drive bays, 20 cores, 192 GB ram... Would this be a good choice for the things I want to do? If so, what operating system should i consider running? I like proxmox, but how will I use the drives as a NAS (preferably with some redundancy)? I have heard that i'll have to do some advanced stuff to the hardware RAID card if I want to install truenas - plus, I'm not sure that TruNAS as the os would let me do all the VM stuff I want to do. I'd love some advice on how to make this work. Thanks in advance!

 I recently have tried to use wg-easy with similar results. I connect to the VPN but cannot load anything.
 Where should I start to try and get this working? Could there be an issue with router settings that would be blocking something?

I was using the arch aur but it failed me and it was not missing some features. I got the whole complete package placed, the database working with the db templates imported. I was able to setup the front end working with nginx. But i could not find any explicit instructions to manual create the service for the server or agent to get the ball rolling. 
 I already looked at the zabbix manual. Not enough detailed info about the services and creating the systemctl files. Any one mind pointing my into the right direction.
 I will be retrying the aur to extract any info about the services i need.
 Please and thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently using my 2 x 16Tb disk in RAID1 setup build on Synology 918. I'm looking for expansion options. I have considered so far following: - adding new 16Tb drive and building RAID5 - adding new 16Tb drive on side as standalone - adding 2 x new 4Tb in RAID1 and building RAID0 2x16Tb - adding 2 x new 4Tb in RAID1 and leaving 2 x 16Tb each standalone
 My critical data (documents, photos etc) are around 3Tb in size, currently placed on 16Tb volume together with some unnecessary data like movies, TV shows, ISO data store for ESXi etc. 
 I'm slowly increasing critical data, but the non critical one is growing really fast.
 In first option, I will have one volume, but with RAID5. Considering my critical data is being backed up to USB, I could take risk of potential rebuild of 32Tb volume, but still it's RAID5. In last option, my critical data would move to separate volume, while non critical data could spin on standalone 2x16Tb drives.
 Which would you recommend to me? Is that RAID5 really a risk if the critical data is backed up? I'm also worried about speed in RAID5, but maybe nvme cache is an option?
 Guys please advise, as I'm bit lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been using WD Easystore 14TB HDs USB connected to my laptop for over a year. Plex works swimmingly and I've never had any issues. Recently I decided I wanted a bit more of a legit setup and am tired of the USB clutter and WD enclosures. I plan to shuck these and use them in the new server (aware of the white label drive's pin, etc).
 I am lazy and not a hardware techy, so I bought this previously owned server from someone. Here's the description:
 "Built this to run my plex server using unraid. have upgraded my system. No harddrives included. This holds 5 harddrives. Small and compact. Asrock H97M -ITX/AC motherboard Intel i5 -4590 Processor Crucial Balistic 16GB Ram Corsair CX500M Power Supply Lian Li - PC-Q25 Case 2 Noctua Fan Case" 
 I do NOT plan to use UNRAID or TRUEnas. I will use Windows and this thing will be a Plex server exclusively.
 Here's the images of it: https://ibb.co/jbsD83r https://ibb.co/09pTdcy https://ibb.co/3S0st6M https://ibb.co/YWrs2Jk https://ibb.co/J5jZNcw
 So my questions are:
  
How plug and play ready is this once I put my HDs in? 
 Can I use this with my existing laptop? 
 What are things I must know besides the obvious Plex oriented things?
 Advice??
  
Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I’m hoping that this is the correct community to ask in, but if I’m in tht wrong place I apologize in advance 
 I need to drastically increase the storage on my home network and also want to add redundancy. 
 I was looking at older Drobo models, which looked fantastic. I like the idea of a NAS that just uses the available disk space without needing have all the drives match exactly. I’ve read that Linux support is lacking, though. Ext3 is fine, but ext4 isn’t, apparently. 
 I also appreciate that they come with USB and network connectivity. That way you don’t have to decide whether it’ll be connected directly to a server or hosted on the network. 
 Can anyone suggest another consumer grade enclosure or NaS that’s comparable? USB and Ethernet, with support for mix and match drives, And is compatible with ext4?
 A while ago, I found a Linux application that could do the mismatched drives, but forgot the name. But because it could only be used as network storage it didn’t seem compelling 
 My reading about synologies indicates that they need identical sized drives, so that nixes them. 
 What else is out there? Any suggestions appreciated!

Provide full-text search for documents that contain text
 Provide metadata search/filtering on all documents
 (bonus) Provide OCR capabilities for PDFs/Images
  
The kicker is that I want my folder structure to continue being a disorganized mess. All I want to do is point the the thing at the root directory of the share, and have it make the files searchable.
 Is there anything that can do this?
 I searched everywhere for this, and the common suggestion is Paperless-ngx. Paperless seems like a good solution, but it insists on reorganizing everything into it's own folder structure. It sounds like they do this to avoid checking document hashes on each crawl, but none the less.
 I also heard Ambar suggested, but it looks like it's now abandonware.

I see references to nginx, lets encrypt, and some other tools. But all of the solutions I read into, so far, had some kind of internet dependence. Others have browser issues. Has anyone gone down this road and found a solution that they really like??? I am not a complete newb, but the last time I did this, I was creating my own certs in a local tool for vm's. I am not sure that works with current browsers based on what I am reading. TIA!!!

 I have a home desktop running Windows 10. One SSD to run Windows, assorted programs, and a Linux virtual machine, and three HDDs full of personal data. I'm backing up to an external WD Elements HDD.
 I'd like to have a image backup of my SSD without the Linux VM, another image backup of just the VM, and a file level backup of my multiple data drives.
 A couple other questions:
 If I run incremental backups can I eventually consolidate those files on the backup drive and be able to compare the consolidated full backup files against my local files?
 Final question for anyone patient and kind enough to still be reading this, if I rename local files on my local data drives and reorganize their folders, would a file level backup program end up making duplicates or be able to track the name/folder changes?

 1. I don't want continuous backup, I want to do it manually.
 I don't have enough changing data on my desktop to need any sort of continuous backup. The data I'm looking to backup is mainly just 1) decades of old photos, videos, documents that aren't ever being changed/updated, 2) a handful of documents I update from time to time (e.g. weekly, monthly), and 3) new documents that show up infrequently and don't get updated after that (e.g. yearly tax documents).
 So, I basically just have a bunch of stuff I'd like to manually upload somewhere and store as a backup (in addition to the external drive I already do this with), and then I'd like to manually upload some additional stuff or an updated version of a file that's already being stored on occasion.
 2. I do want zero-knowledge encryption. 
 For all the usual security/privacy reasons.
 What would be the best option(s) for this purpose? 
 Thanks in advance for any advice.

However, I also collect lots of courses, such as Udemy, CBT Nuggets, and YouTube playlists, as well as books and comics. Is there any solution that can help with the organisation and playback of these types of media? I don't mind manually adding everything to it, just a nicer way to organise them and play them back
 Courses I could probably handle with Jellyfin, but it'd be cool if there was something else designed specifically for them, especially as many courses are both videos and text based

 I found a good deal on a second hand corsair 900d and thinking of getting it. But I may need additional drive cages later on. Since it is a pretty old case, I think it is impossible to get it from corsair or find it online.
 How compatible are drive cages from other cases would be with this one? Or would it be possible to get it 3d printed? I don't care for the looks, I just would like to be able to add more drive cages when I need it.
 This will be my first time building a pc so, sorry if it is a stupid question
 Also if you have other comments on the case itself, please share

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 trying to spool up my own instance of anonaddy. I was able to get it running, but am having trouble sending and receiving mail through it. Here is the run down.
 - Port 25 is enabled through my ISP and port forwarded on my router to my servers IP using TCP.
 - I setup some DNS records through my cloudflare. See redacted screen shot:
 DKIM is using selector in compose file and p value is the public key generated by anonaddy
 - MXtoolbox shows all good signs using several checks, no syntax errors or heavy mistakes.
 - Redacted Docker-compose as follows: 
 APP_KEY & ANONADDY_SECRET use different long string values. POSTFIX_RELAYHOST is using my ISP's relay server.
 - I do not have a static IP and cannot get one because of limitations of my ISP (I think). Also, I do not think I can alter reverse DNS info either. Help needed here if possible.
 - I get logs (redacted) as follows when the server tries to send email verification:
  mail postfix/smtp[1022]: to=<mypersonalgmail@gmail.com>, relay=POSTFIX_RELATHOST VALUE[00.00.00.0]:25, delay=2, delays=0.11/0.03/1.2/0.63, dsn=2.0.0, status=sent (250 <> Mail accepted) 
 - My initial guess is that I am getting filtered my other mail servers for reverse DNS reasons and do not want to push it too hard and end up on some ban list. 
 - check.spamhaus.org stated that my ISP blocks port 25 and that I should use a relay which they provided (currently this is my POSTFIX_RELAYHOST value) 
 I feel like I am so close. If someone could shine some light or just let me know if this is impossible to setup with my ISP. At least I could get some closure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have had a couple second hand servers and have been tinkering with them for quite a few months, but now I want to set them up in a more “professional” way (basically not having a messy chaos as I have right now). What would be ideal for me:
  
Production node: this node will be hosting the VMs and containers I want to be HA, and that can’t afford to be down/broken if I screw up (Nextcloud, Home Assistant, Nginx, AdGuard, etc.).
 Tinkering node: a node fully used for testing and trying stuff (VMs, Docker, OSs, etc.)
 Storage node: a node used only for storage for the other two nodes (probably iSCSI). The other nodes will have just two mirrored SSDs for booting, and maybe another two for latency-sensible VMs in the production node.
  
My goals: - Scalability: having storage-oriented and performance-oriented nodes makes the setup more flexible when trying to upgrade the cluster. - Flexibility: being able to move VMs between nodes without much hassle is KEY for me. Having the ability to move VMs from the servers to a PC Hypervisor and viceversa would also be ideal, but I understand that this is more complicated to achieve. - Ease of use: managing everything through a single interface would be much appreciated. Also being able to run Docker directly on the Hypervisor would be great. An easy to use offsite backup solution is also important.
 For the moment I have just used Proxmox (independent nodes, not clustering), and while the experience has been mostly great, it lacks some features, being Docker the most important one. I wanted to know what you guys are using and what is your experience. Thanks in advance!

 I'm currently using Fedora Server with docker containers, and I was wondering if any of you are using Fedora IoT (based on RPM-ostree) with Podman since it is "marketed" as the future of servers. More generally, I would like to know what are the tools (like Nix, snap, ...) you are using and/or plan/want to use and WHY. 
 I have a bit of free time right now, and I might spend it trying out new tools just for fun.
 Thx and happy holidays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Around this time of year, I start to get itchy fingers and need a project to kill a day or so, off i went researching and have now pfsense running 10Gb, totally overkill yes but hey ho
 Spec: i5-7500T 16Gb 512GB nvme 10Gb Mellanox ConnectX-3 MCX312A-XCBT 1x 10Gb DAC 1x 10GBASE-T SFP+ RJ45 Transceiver Module (FS.com SFP-10G-T) 3x Zyxel XGS1210-12 around the house
 ISP - 1Gb Virgin Media UK - SH5 in Modem mode using 2.5GBe port.
 Running proxmox just for the hell of it, the machine runs at 15W-17W idle which is pretty good for 10Gb card and 10GBASE-T module as they run quite power heavy. 
 I may setup another pihole for HA but will have to see, got to make most of proxmox!
 Currently running Cat5e and Cat6 around the house so using the 2.5Gb switch ports for some runs, this works quite well, my Unraid server has a 2.5Gbe onboard and iperf from pfsense to it maxes out the 2.5gbe, im also taking advantage of the over-provisioning Virgin do with the speeds.
 Next is to grab a 10Gbe card for Unraid and see if I can get away with running anything up to 10Gb over Cat6
 This all replaced a HP T730 with 4x Intel Nic card
 All good fun!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: a natural language search engine for personal data archives .
 Iv'e pulling a lot of old stuff from my archive lately, the thing is, the HDD (10tb seagate) is way too slow for searching in realtime, more over, I can't actually search with natural language so to find what I'm looking for I need to try a couple of searches.
 That's why I decided to build haystack, a search engine for data, meant for finding technical details or relevant paragraphs..
 It enables you to search large HDDs or slack, confluence, email all in one place.
 no internet connection required.
 It supports natural language queries so a query like: "where was I last spring?"yields:
 4 documents, 3 photos, and two emails 
 haystack stores user data locally, so there's no security risk - only you have access to internal docs, I didn't want to deal with security compliance headaches caused from storing user data in the cloud.
 Rolled it out to my co-workers and friends a week ago and they thought it's a hit, and also less bugging, so I'm planning on releasing it publicly on March 2023.
 Early access
 If you want to try it out before March 2023 - Early access
 or Github
 Thanks, Yuval

 Highlights
  
Suitable for deployment on low configuration servers.
 Simple and practical.
 Diosic can categorize subfolders in your music folder. For example, if there are English, Chinese
  
, Japanese subfolders under your music folder, they will be automatically classified into three lists. This is also my original intention to develop Diosic.
 I'm new to Rust. Thank You.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Im using Office 365 Business in the moment for 5€/month.
 However, as I switched to self-hosting von Calender/Contacts/Files, it seems not to be the ideal solution anymore (especially privacy).
 So I'm thinking to get a Protonmail Premium Subscription (2 years for 7,19€ per month).
 I will use my own domain, so it's not about anonymity, I just want my mails be stored encrypted so that not even the provider can access it.
 Protonmail is using a bridge (for Linux, PC, Mac) to encrypt the mails and server a local IMAP server via 127.0.0.1.
 However, as it's binding to 127.0.0.1, you would need to install it on every device, and it's not possible on smartphones.
 Because of this, I want to create a virtual machine so that I can reach the local IMAP server via VPN also on my smartphones.
 How can I open the localhost IMAP-port to my local network? Maybe NGINX is a solution? 
 And besides of this: Do you think switching from Outlook to Protonmail is a good decision?
 Is their infrastructure safe enough and is it ensured they will exist the full 2 years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Homelab Community!
 I've been enjoying this subreddit for some time now, while trying to figure out how to set up my own home network/lab. Based on what I've learnt here (and elsewhere), I have a plan. But I would love to get some feedback from the community.
 Motivation: Update my home network from my 10 year old router running OpenWRT to something more performent, secure, and future proof. Also to learn about networking and have some fun.
 Background: I don't work in tech, but I do programming for work (data science) and I have some basic knowledge when it comes to hardware. However, networking is pretty new to me; the most advanced thing I've done is to flash OpenWRT on my router and set up some VLANs (I also had some home automation stuff on a RasperryPi many years back).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a VPS with an encrypted virtual drive and RSA key-pair authentification.
 Technically speaking, can my provider somehow login to my VPS (by changing the rsa key for example or something) and therefore have access to my data ?
 EDIT : More info about my setup :
 Password authentification is disabled, I only use keys to login with SSH.When creating the VPS I generated the keys on my local computer and only gave my provider the public key.Cloud-init is disabled and I'm running vanilla Ubuntu server.I never used web console to login.
 EDIT 2 : I came to the conclusion it's nearly impossible to prevent them from reading my data.
 1 - They can get my password from the RAM
 2 - The data is decrypted when the system is running anyway. 
 I guess the only way to prevent them is to encrypt my data on my local machine before uploading it.
 Thank you all, I learned so much from your answers.
 Thanks

 I don't understand why the drives are spinning down. I've used hdparm to set the -B value to 255 but it gets reset to 20 after a while. I set it in a udev rule so its set at boot up, but again, after a while, it's back at 20.
 I don't have TLP or any other power management script/tool that I know of. The logs don't show anything interesting. I've tried searching but there's not a lot of info about not wanting the drives to sleep, usually it's the opposite.
 I've tried setitng -S 0 along with -B 255 with hdparm. I updated /etc/hdparm.conf to set the APM value to 255 for each of my spinning drives. 
 Is there something else I'm missing that is changing the APM value of the drives?

My main concern is that many applications seem to just prefer to only use LDAP. As a systems administrator in my day job, I have plenty of experience with Windows Server and Active Directory on there, but I'm keen to not use Windows at home for such purpose
 So naturally, there's OpenLDAP and Samba AD, neither of which I've ever used (save for Samba for my NAS). Then there's these big and complex solutions like Authentik and Keycloak, but I'm not sure either of these have their own LDAP solution, and just sync from an existing LDAP server

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I still use optical media for certain things and the one thing that I've never been able to find for sale but always use are the paper inserts that go into jewel cases, especially the front one (or the only one if you're using slim jewel cases). I'm not a fan of making my own so I was wondering if anyone has ever come across nice lined jewel case inserts for sale (the slightly glossy ones like what you would get if you're buying Verbatim DVD-R discs individually packaged in jewel cases)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I didn't really know where to share this but I thought I should mention.
 So when one of the big problems I have with western comic books in comparison to manga is that I just don't know where to start. I'd like to read the in universe collection I just don't know how to.
 And this is where this reading order comes in.
 https://comicbookreadingorders.com/
 I've compiled the entire list in several cbz for a more seamless experience. 
 I have done marvel master reading order part 1-10,Marvel Now, all new all different marvel, Marvel Legacy, A Fresh Start.
 and for Dc master reading order part 1-7, The new 52, DC you, rebirth.
 Marvel's has many more comics and is monstrously larger than DC. 
 I don't want you guys to think that I'm asking to archive it for me to use later. I have my own digital archive. I am keeping it careful. But i thought I should mention it for the comic book fans that are interested.
 Its on Torrentgalaxy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 This sub has helped me a great deal with backing up my work, so I thought I’d ask a question here. I often make huge backups overnight. As I’m fairly clumsy, I’ll occasionally knock a wire or something, and the process will be interrupted. In todays instance, I knocked the off button in my new hard drive enclosure. I had some errors on screen (“unable to move movie.mp4”) but turning it back on again, I could click “try again” and the process resumed as before. My question is, will it be corrupted, or will windows simply move the whole file from the start again? I can always check the files are the same size after the move perhaps, just to check. Should I be worried? Would I need to start the process over?
 Thanks, Harry

 I recently got myself an R310 and I need to find some rails that work with a 36" rack. I bought some rails for the R310, but they fall a bit short of the end of my rack, so I can't use those. I'm struggling to find any ReadyRails that will fit the R310 and a 36" rack, and I don't want to resort to using universal rails unless I have to. Does anyone know of the part number for rails that would suit my needs?

 But don't really know what NIC to get, I got an NAS which is being used at least a couple of hours a day for large files. So 2,5 or 10 would be better in my eyes. Also in the market for a new switch so 2.5 and 10 are an option.
 Currently looking at the following 3 NICS, but open for suggestions;
 HP Ethernet 10Gb 2-port 561FLR-T
 HP FlexFabric 10Gb 2-port 533FLR-T
 Intel PRO/1000 PT Dual or Quad 
 The reason for those NICS, is that I can buy them second hand here in Europe for under 50 euros.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I recently got a cheap (280€) Dual Xeon Silver 4110 based Supermicro Server with 128GB RAM on eBay.
 The system itself works just fine however the CPUs are too slow for the intended purpose as a virtualization server. 
 I'm now unsure whether it's worth upgrading the CPUs to some Xeon Gold Chips as most of them are priced at 250-300€ per CPU on eBay. 
 At around 600€ I can already buy a similar performing second-hand AMD EPYC-based CPU including a new motherboard. 
 As electricity is getting super expensive (59ct per kWh in Germany) I have to consider the power consumption as well. 
 I'd love to hear your advice as I'm not sure if it's worth spending more money on the Intel Scalable platform or just leaving the system as it is and maybe using it for something else. 
 I'd also have to upgrade the RAM, It currently has 8*16 2666MHz sticks, can I mix it with a few 32GB or even 64GB sticks with the same speed? 
 Thanks!

 So I'm very new to homeservers. I'm currently running Nextcloud and some projects on a Raspberry Pi 4B with an external ssd. I've been looking into a NAS for a while now and wish to learn and experiment a bit more with a homelab / NAS server.
 What I want to do:
  
Run proxmox as a host OS, deploy different VM's/containers for services like Nextcloud, HA, Jellyfin, TrueNAS. At the moment I don't need too much storage, I would like to be able to expand in the future. 
  
​
 What I've been looking to get:
 ​
  
 CPU AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (AWOF Boxed) Hexa Core, ECC support € 89,90 
  
 MB ASRock fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/ac € 114,90 
  M.2 NVE SSD WD PC SN730 (SED) 256GB (for OS) € 39,99 
  RAM 2x 16GB KINGSTON KSM26ED8/16HD (ECC support) € 60,03 each, € 120,06 total 
  CASE Fractal Design Node 304 € 91,00 
  HDD 2x Seagate IronWolf NAS HDD, 4TB € 83,95 each, €167,90 total 
  PSU Cooler Master V550 SFX Gold € 63,61 
   Total € 687,21 
 
 Is this a solid start or do you have any other recommendations? Also energy out here is not cheap at all. I'm currently paying around € 0,70/kWh here, so it would be nice to keep this low..

 The real Question/Problem is VMs in TrueNas. Does anybody know what’s best practice for doing VM Backups in TrueNas Scale?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I purchased a Terramaster D3-400 a few months ago so that I could set up a home server with a ZFS pool. I put four Toshiba N300 4TB drives in the box and set it up with TrueNAS on an Intel NUC. It works pretty well except the disk drives spun constantly: they never went to sleep.
 It wasn't the fastest thing on two feet though, so I decided: let's just use it as it was intended, a direct attach storage device. I hook it up to my Windows 11 laptop, and... it seems to power off randomly. In order to bring the device back up I have to unplug the DAS and then it can be recognized by the OS again. This morning I tried writing about half a terabyte to it and it turned itself off after a few dozen gig.
 I am not 100% sure I trust this thing. I know it was a bargain, many of the reviews were positive, but I'm not putting my life's work on it in the meantime.
 Has anyone else had a similar experience? Any way to spin down the disks or keep the box awake?

These 2 computers are plugged into our provided combo router/modem provided by our ISP (it doesn’t have any other ports sadly)
 While acquiring or building a NAS sounds fun in a geeky way, I am looking into the best value option to handle this task, even if it mean using built-in Windows features.

However, both of them make this weird periodic thumping sound when they are running. I do not know if this is a normal behaviour of the drives, or I am just unlucky enough to have two defective drives. When I touch the drive, it feels like very gentle baby kicks. I have already zero-filled the drive to check if there's anything wrong, but nothing seems to stand out in SMART tests. Should I be concerned? I can send audio samples of what it sounds like, if it helps.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The local ISP has decided that 100mbps should now cost $200 usd, 200mpbs $300 and so on. They are the only wired provider that provides anything over 10 mbps. So, I switched to the tmobile home internet and get 300mbps for an amazing deal of free for the next 5 months then 25/month after that. The only problem is I can't pass traffic to my synology as it does not have nat. They claim it's a IPV6 problem. I researched into different products and found Packetriot. They are using a external server and having a tunnel between it and whatever you install it on. Well, I have an external server in a free oracle instance, arm processor. So, Could I use the oracle box, and have my synology nas tunnel into it? What software would I need on both ends? Anyone done anything like this before?
 ​
 Update: I have tailscale up and running. My desktop and my cloud are talking and I am able to pass traffic between the two. Now, i need to figure out how to have a external domain name pass through the tailscale to the synology. Will update with more information.

 BlueIris had choppy video playback for me, possibly due to transcoding caused by no direct write in the demo version.
 Shinobi mobile app sucks badly
 iSpy works well, but monthly subscription for mobile access is dumb.
 xProtect works great, but mobile app has no direct streaming in the free version, and the transcoding causes stuttering playback.
 Luxriot is no longer free
 Frigate looks a bit more in depth then I need.
 Only other real option is zoneminder?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was supposed to have lifetime unlimited GDrive from my uni, but Google is ending their contracts with UK schools in 2023. A NAS is not an option for me for various reasons, so I'm looking for cloud storage to replace gdrive.
 How I intend to use it is to have all my files on several external SSDs and to back those up. I can't use a service where the backup has to reflect the files on my computer, as I use a desktop and laptop.
 Looking for about 4TB minimum. Able to spend about £10 a month. Anyone have any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently a researcher and am fortunate to be at an institution with an excellent library system. However, this will likely not always be the case, and I'd like to archive about as much of the academic literature as possible (particularly relevant to my work, but also in some other fields of interest). The dream would be to create an "antilibrary" in the style of Umberto Eco. 
 I use Zotero on an unlimited storage plan and have ~4.5 TB of total available open space (working on filling this!). Papers don't take up that much space at all; the limiting factor is my own throughput. It'd be great to find an automated workflow so as to download & organize papers. My access to journals is generally mediated through EZProxy, but this is avoidable on local WiFi. Does anyone have experience with the Zotero API and/or EZProxy to do this (or similar tools)?

 I have 2 container on my portainer, which want to use port 8080 redirected to 80.
 The first One works, the second one (of course?) not. Whats the easiest way to change that ports for the second container? Is that a thing in the image, or @portainer? 
 I tried the portainer option for ports redirect in the container deployment like 8181 -->> 8080 but that doesnt work for me.
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently using an old desktop PC (i5-3570k) as a simple home server with Ubuntu and ZFS. The only purpose of the server is to archive a bunch of data that I rarely access and to act as a Time Machine (macOS backup) target. For this reason, it spends 90% of its time suspended.
 My problem is that the server is in the hall together with my home router, but I have no way to connect to it through Ethernet from my PC in my bedroom, so I have to use Wi-Fi and this causes the Time Machine backups to be unbearably slow.
 I thought about 2 possible "solutions":
  
Move the server in my bedroom, in order to connect it to my laptop via Ethernet to make things faster and to reduce latency. This would also mean having to connect to the AP via Wi-Fi (i.e. much slower and less reliable Internet access).
 Remove everything from the case apart from the PSU and the disks and turn the PC into a poor man's USB DAS (located in my bedroom). This would mean higher speed and lower power consumption.
  
For my current situation, it looks like solution 2 is the better deal. A NAS is certainly more flexible, but right now I only use a single PC and I don't see that changing in the near future.
 What do you guys think? Am I missing anything / are there other smarter solutions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if I missed this feature before, but it seems Standard Notes has a feature for uploading files now: https://docs.standardnotes.com/self-hosting/file-uploads
 I'm failing to understand how that works. I'm failing to understand the security requirements for that as the documentation I linked to is way too vague.
 Do I have to create a reverse proxy to that port, which defaults to 3125? Or is it secure by default?
 The docs say the api_gateway won't be used. But then in docker-compose I see that the api_gateway uses the variable FILES_SERVER_URL... why? What is it used for? And how does that relate to EXPOSED_FILES_PORT? Do I just have to set EXPOSED_FILES_PORT considering I'm using docker, and forget about the URL and let tcp forwarding do its magic? Well, then more questions pop up.
 How does Standard Notes know where to send the file requests? How does standard notes know whether they're proxied with a reverse-proxy to decide on the communication protocol? Does it try both http and https? If there's no reverse proxy, how is the end-to-end encryption done? Where's the encryption key?
 Way too many questions in my head about this thing... I'd really appreciate explaining anything you can about this. Especially how you set this up.
 Also, one more bonus thing, can I store the files in the database instead of in a separate file-storage? That'd be really nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, I've been lurking here for a while now and I've started going down the rabbit hole of self hosting.
 I'm currently running a RPi4 with 3xHDDs that previously was just managing backups, handling remote torrenting (DelugeD), and hosting an Emby server (recently switched to Jellyfin). 
 I've recently added a few other things to the mix (Navidrome, Audiobookshelf, Changedetection.io) and I'm wanting to go further (Photoprism, which seemed too heavy for the Pi when I tried it out, RSS, etc.) I'm thinking I should probably move a lot of this to another machine. I've got an old (c. 2015?) Gateway desktop with Linux Mint Mate installed and I'm wondering if this machine either sounds good as is, could use some upgrades, or even shouldn't be used as a long-term solution.
 Motherboard: Acer IPISB-VR Rev 1.01 (Supports Intel (Socket Type – LGA 1155): Core i7 (Quad Core), Core i5, Core i3)
 CPU: 2.8GHz Intel Core i5 2300 Quad Core
 RAM: 8GB DDR3 (16GB Max)
 GPU: GeForce GTX 950
 PSU: EVGA 700B
 1.5TB HDD
 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet
 I've been thinking it could use some new thermal paste (the fans go wild and temps have random spikes), maybe a $20 upgrade to 16GB RAM, and maybe even a CPU upgrade of some sort.
 Thoughts and suggestions appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 This sub has been very good to me giving me advice for my first server build. Well I am back and in true DataHorder style, I'm out of space on that server so I'm in the process of planning my new NAS/Server and need your advice again.
 My current setup:
  
Its is a custom built Hyper-V server with a big storage pool and a few VMs on it (including Plex).
 The pool is a triple mirror pool with about 45TB effective capacity.
 VMs run Centos (in case that matters).
  
What I'm looking for:
  
~200TB effective storage
 2 disk redundancy (meaning I can lose 2 disks and not loose the pool). I am open to a 'raid-6' config or similar for efficiency.
 don't need a lot of horsepower here to run VMs as that is and will be handled on my existing server.
 Minimum- Storage needs to be fast enough to stream 4K HDR movies (about 200Mbps) but ideally would like it to be able to handle gigabit read and writes.
  
Option 1: Buy a NAS
  
I was considering buying a Synology 12 bay unit and filling it with (12) 20TB Exos drives but know they made a change recently where their NAS's only support their Synology branded drives and these 20TB drives wouldn't fit that. Not sure how advisable it is to run non-supported drives on these units. Also not sure if I would bump up against the Maximum Volume size. I think I would need the DS3622XS+ due to said limit.
 I'm also open to other manufacturers if you have one to recommend.
  
Option 2: Build a NAS
  
The other option is to build my own. Admittedly I will need some help with this specifically with software and hardware recommendations. I'm not sure how much hardware horsepower ill need to handle this much storage. With regard to software, what's the preferred choice for a pool of this size?
  
I am very open to any info or feedback that you have and am happy to provide any more details.
 Thanks in advance!

Today i decided to make a cloudflare tunnel (say what you will its works the best for me) and all went well until i set a password once i do that i am able to login no problem using my local ip but from my domain even if i type the right password it just gives me the prompt again. Sometimes it loads the main page but not fully. I tried multiple accounts and made sure that the box for allowing public access t o front is checked. What should i do the fact that on my local ip works is weird, any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 TL.DR: I'm looking for a self-hosted media library solution that is able to catalog various media. Serving media is not a requirement.
 What I actually mean with that, I have movies that I've ripped from Blu-Rays, Blu-Rays themselves, DVDs, Audio CDs and a lot other media that I'd like to catalog to basically just see what movies or music I have and on what media. Ideally it would also go over my collection, recognise it and download metadata, like album art, release date, etc.
 I've already looked at Jellyfin and other media servers, but neither of them were the one (I'm not looking at Plex for various reasons). I've found a macOS app, Movie Explorer (https://betamagic.nl/products/movieexplorer.html) that would be perfect, but it's a macOS app and it can only be used by one person. I'd prefer something with a web GUI where users (family members) can enter and/or look up data. I'm not looking for a solution that would also stream it (though it's a nice-to-have, I already have a solution for that), just pure cataloging is enough to get started.
 Can anyone point me to the right direction?
 Thank you very much!

 For now its somewhat limited, it just displays top stats for some categories, and a history, but it does work pretty stable.
 I plan on adding charts and stuff when I have some spare time.
 It is written in elixir and of course, it's free and open source. I have some docker images ready, so it's easy to get it running.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company provides a hosted SaaS product that our customers use to create web pages - actually much more involved than that but irrelevant for the purposes of this. The problem is that often clients want to include images or PDFs in the pages or as links on the pages which is not a problem but I've resisted allowing clients to upload all of this stuff to our servers for a variety of reasons - partly because I know they'd never get cleaned up but also because our application runs in a docker container and with a set of ansible scripts I can build a server with a very complex setup from a vanilla OS to fully deployed in around 8 minutes so if I did provide a way for clients to upload files then it would have to be stored in our database layer rather than in the file system so that it doesn't matter which server the request goes to. Currently, we tell the clients to upload images to any image hosting service and to use a public link but I would like to improve our offering without putting the burden into our SaaS application. There';s nothing sensitive or that needs to not be publicly accessible other than not serving a directory listing.
 I started looking at nextcloud the other day just out of interest and that made me wonder if there is something with a web interface where I can allow clients to upload their own files to a web server but with a single domain for all files on the server with each client being seen as a subdirectory so I can get away without having to manage multiple certificates for https.
 I realise it's a very specific question and that there may not be anything that'll do what I want but I'm wondering if anyone knows of something before I start looking at building our own solution?
 TIA

 However when I point Picard at it and try to tag tracks, Picard's Authentication dialogue pops up. The self-hosted server tells me it can't provide an authentication code for Picard, and codes generated by the musicbrainz.org site don't work.
 Has anyone got this working? It sounds like an obvious use case for the self-hosted server and I have 70,000 tracks I'd like to tag!
 EDIT - I've got it working - it's because I was logged into my musicbrainz.org account in Picard and didn't log out before changing the server address to my local IP.
 EDIT 2 - I used the Installation instructions for Metabrainz's own musicbrainz-docker github repo to get this working, rather than Linuxserver.io's image (which I've never been successful with!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So folks, I'm the designated "IT" person in the family. And my google-fu is weak on this one. 
 This family member has them in 2 OWC enclosures that houses 2x20TB drives each. I only have access to their macbook and the connection will be via thunderbolt.
 So far, I've done the badblocks route for 50% of the drives, only to learn that I cannot run the remaining 50% of the drive because the end block value exceeds the 32bit integer. I've also tried to do my homework and now understand that changing the -b argument of badblocks to exceed the 4096 block size will render the badblocks result questionable. So silly me for not researching too much into it before running badblocks on all four drives simultaneously (the first 50% for all four drives passed without any incident).
 So, my questions is, how can I at test the remaining 50% or what are some other tests that are available to me that does not involve spending $$$ for paid solutions? 
 I saw a passing comment about encrypting the drive fully via Disk Utility and then checking the SMART status. Is this a viable approach to checking the drives? This family member just wants to know that the drives will not die prematurely. I, personally, think that the drives will be fine, but these drives will be used to store their livelihood, so I understand where they are coming from.
 Any input anyone can provide would be great. Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, today I attempted to host my own minecraft server on my router so I wouldn't have to pay for one as I was under the asssumption this would be easy. It was not.
 What is strange is that I was able to connect 1 time with no issues and then never again.
 When I attempt to connect with my public IP address I get the error "Connection timed out: no further information."
 When I attempt to connect with "localhost" I get the error "Connection refused: no further information"
 To my knowledge have set up my port forwarding properly with the proper IPv4 address, type (TCP/UDP) and start & end port.
 I have the most updated versions of Java
 I have enabled the setting “Enable the operating system’s restricted environment” in the Java Control Panel Advanced Settings
 I have changed my network settings
 I tried a network reset
 I restarted my computer & router many times
 I have allowed Java through my firewall (I even attempted to connect with Windows Defender disabled and it still didn't work)
 I feel as if I could have possibly made a mistake when port forwarding as I do not have much knowledge on the subject but I am pretty confident that I set it up correctly.
 Please let me know if there is a possible solution. Thank you.

 Now I'm considering putting a 2TB PCIe 4.0 NVME drive into the second available NVME slot I have on the motherboard, and doing a fresh Window install on it, after which I'll move what little important data I have onto it from the 1TB NVME and then format that drive.
 At this point I'll have the 2TB boot drive, plus the 1TB NVME and 2TB HDD used as data overflow of sorts. I'd like to go ahead and get those later two drives combined into one volume for ease of use, and I'm wondering what's the best "cheap-to-free" way to go about this.
 I'm using a AMD CPU and motherboard, so I have their StoreMI software available to me, plus Windows own "storage spaces" solution built into the OS.
 Has anyone done any sort of comparison between these two options to see which performs better? I'm not looking for any sort of nitty-gritty numbers but I figure I may as well lean into whichever works better.
 Thanks.
 Late Edit: OR should I just scrap the ol' spinner entirely and just use the two NVME drives manually?

 I have a full depth rack (1m) but I can adjust the mounting depth. For now I put the router mid rack, but even so, a lot of cables don't come close so I can't mount a patch panel at the same depth.
 I could mount the panel at the back of the rack and use long patch cables. Alternatively, I could cut the wires (I already terminated them) and extend them with a shielded cat6a junction box. 
 What do you suggest as the best approach? 
 Attached is a picture of the current mess I'm trying to tidy up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gday all. It’s time for a rebuild of things, so I thought I’d sit down and hammer this all out, and started questioning the path forward. Wanted to know your suggestions, and thoughts on it.
 Up until now, things have been a mix of HyperV, which I want to move away from, and into Proxmox. Proxmox has been great for me, but sometimes doesn’t feel like the right fit for me. I generally run about 6-8 little servers, and feel like im pounding my head against the wall setting up LXC containers or even full out VM’s and compiling or installing programs from scratch when there is a docker/podman alternative sitting there waiting for me.
 I started playing a bit with the Turnkey machines in Proxmox, and while it worked, there seemed to be some issues with a few of the images, and googling around, others have some full on hate for them, so maybe thats not where I want to spend my time either.
 So I go back to maybe I should dabble (never have) in Docker or Podman. Ok…but in that case, I will need to manage a base OS. What does everyone do here? One comment I saw was running Proxmox, and then a VM inside that runs Docker…which just seems weird to me, but maybe thats ok?
 Where should I spend my time learning here? Open to suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm currently trying to part out a homelab from scratch (current set up is no more than a 2012 dell with some more ram and a few extra drives in it) and I was hoping for some tips and pointers from those who have treaded this path before. I will add that I’m no stranger to parting out and building gaming computers, but I’ve never touched anything like this outside of finding a new use for my old Dell XPS 8700.
 I've recently finished my undergrad and I’m currently residing in London, so cost and space are a premium. I’m thinking a sub-ATX motherboard that I can readily source from the used market. 
 The most demanding thing it will be doing is hosting VM’s and serving as a rendering box and so I’m more than happy to use a platform that’s a few generations old.
 Right off the bat I’m not sure if I should go with a consumer/pro-summer/server motherboard. I know you can get retired server and workstation gear for cheap on the used market but I worry that must be folly for my application.
 Professional features like remote management would be a ‘nice to have’ but not at all necessary for my application. 
 In regards to RAM, I have heard ECC memory is either 'a nice to have' or ‘damn right crucial’ for ZFS depending where I ask, and so some advice on memory type would be greatly appreciated.
 Besides that, if people could post what CPUs and cases they run for a budget and space friendly set up that would be greatly appreciated. I’ll post a couple that I have bookmarked incase anyone has any experience with them.

 Example: https://pastebin.com/Wk3HJR3s
 Result:
 11FF11FF D:\test\test\[test]\test\[2021-01-01].7z\folder\1.psd 99D59E9A D:\test\test\[test]\test\[2022-01-01].7z\redlof\redlof2\2.psd 
 Each line should have a CRC value at the start and a space between it and the full path of the file, I want this done for any file in the output.

 I have port forwarding setup so that I can ssh to mydomain.com
 On the same server hosting that domain is a gitea instance. I want to enable ssh cloning, but I would like it to be on port 22 also so that the clones aren't cluttered with non-standard ports.
 But it looks like when I attempt to clone I get:
 Cloning into 'repo': git@mydomain.com: Permission denied (publickey)
 I have verified that my ssh keys in gitea are correct and valid. I think maybe it's because git clone is just hitting port 22 and that may or may not hit gitea or the native ssh port?
 Is it possible to run both services on port 22 in this way?

 My QUESTION is if I pull my drives from my NAS bays, swap them with my new drives, will I be able to use, say, my usb-to-sata cable to copy the contents of my old drives to the new ones? 
 My worry is that because the disks are spanning, file contents are split amongst all four drives and that copying one drive at a time will result in corruption. I feel I may be confusing spanning with striping, or RAID 0, where data is written to both drives simultaneously; reason why you lose data when one drive fails. 
 The easy answer is to just buy an external HDD I can copy my NAS to, I'd just like to not buy more HDDs (for now).

 I'm hosting all my services in a DigitalOcean droplet for the past three years and was using an $12/month droplet with 1vCPU and 2GB RAM. However lately I tried to add new self hosted stuff to my stack and the I need more memory.
 I tried to upgrade to 2vCPU 4GB RAM instances and they cost $24-28/month.
 My questions is, do you use these cloud VPS providers, if so, which ones do you recommend? I'd love to host the services in my machine, but this is too convenient for me for the time being, but rather costly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Current score: Brian -4, OCI +1000.
 I spun up a new tenancy in OCI with a single host in the free tier (Ampere 4 CPU, 24GB RAM) to host a mail server for my domain. I have no problem configuring my own DNS records via Cloudflare. It was working just fine with Vultr, but I wanted to try OCI and hey, it's free. With Vultr I was able to configure my reverse PTR record for my external IP (Vultr owned) in my dashboard. It worked great.
 With OCI I submitted a limits request to get TCP/25 inbound unblocked. No problem. Now I need to submit a support request to get a PTR record configured for my OCI owned external IP and I'm hitting nothing but assholes and brick walls. I've tried to submit my support request via the OCI portal about a million times. It tells me I have to provision my support account. Entering my information in that screen tells me that I need to go to support.oracle.com to submit a request for my account admin to authorize my account to submit a ticket. It provides me with my Customer Support ID that I need to provide as well. When I go to support.oracle.com to submit that request to myself it won't accept my CSI that was provided to me by the cloud portal. (The same number found under the tenancy details) The error says my CSI is not valid or doesn't allow registration.
 I've called support for help, one person told me that I need to talk to sales. Another person told me that my support account hasn't been provisioned yet. I left a message for sales who just got back to me telling me to talk to my sales rep. I don't have a sales rep. I don't need guidance on finding my CSI. I just need a human being to pay attention to what I'm saying long enough to understand the issue at hand. 
 Any ideas from the group here? I'm about out of ideas to try and get this figured out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At the moment, my house has a NAS set up (QNAP TS-453D) and Kodi streaming on our TV, with no special media software running on the NAS. Just Kodi accessing the shared files. I also various services set up (portainer, home assistant, transmission, etc) on the local network, but nothing is accessible from outside the network because I just wanted to keep things simple.
 My girlfriend wants to be able to access our videos while travelling, however, and specifically asked if we could set up a Plex server. I'm not sure if it'd be worth the trouble to set up just for the occasions when we're travelling (which is usually to see friends and family, but sometimes while doing that we want to watch movies from our NAS together - right now we just copy those movies to her laptop in advance).
 I figure I could just set up a local VPN server (wireguard?) on the NAS so we can tunnel into the local network and use Kodi to play files that way. But, I'm curious, is there any advantage (or disadvantage) to using Plex remote play instead, or setting up Jellyfin? Would it be more/less secure? Easier/harder to set up? Provide better/worse video quality or performance? Anything else I should know?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr: what are best practices or tips simplicity and security wise for running many vs fewer Containers for many services on a single machine?
 ​
 Hi,
 some months ago I started self-hosting some things on my home server (a simple PC with an Intel i3 10th Gen. (4 x 3.7 GHz), 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, external HDD).
 The hosted services include Nextcloud, Gitea, a Minecraft-Server, Vaultwarden, Heimdall, WikiJS, and NGINX as a reverse proxy, many of them as Docker Containers.
 I just tried things out, followed tutorials, and "hacked" the things together without thinking too much about the overall structure of my build.
 Now that I have quite some services running I'm thinking about the pros and cons of different methods of running these things. Right now I have Proxmox installed on the server and one LXC for each single service (so e.g. 5 LXC's for 5 services) that I'm running, thinking that if I "destroy" one Container, the rest will be still intact, so I don't have to repair too much.
 What do you think are good ways to host the services? One LXC with Docker and all the Docker-based services on that single LXC? Or rather one service per LXC like I do right now, although that means I have to create an LXC, install Docker, ... for every single service? What about security? Is more virtualization really more secure or just more work?
 Personally I don't think VMs are a good choice for me because of resource constraints. That's why I use LXCs.
 I know there might not be the one right way to do it, but I'd like to get some insights so I can make an informed decision.
 ​
 Thanks :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a small business with only 3 people. Looking to setup some kind of File Management system so we can have everything nice and organized like files, documents, bank statements, QuickBooks files, invoices, etc. Right now everything is stored on our main PC and if we need to transfer a file we just email it or something but I'm looking to have it so whatever device you are on you can just open the Files app and have everything you need. I'm open to cloud based or local storage. If local storage is needed I am advanced in computers can set it up.
 We have many things on paper like Receipts, Invoices, Documents. I want to find a way to just digitize everything securely as we have done everything on paper and want to go digital. We have the top of the line equipment Computers, Printers, Receipt & Document Scanners, but just need better organization and ideas. 
 Devices we use regularly:
 3 Desktop PCs
 1 MacBook Pro
 1 iPad Pro
 iPhones for Mobile
 Applications & Software:
 Gmail
 QuickBooks
 Google Sheets
 Adobe Acrobat (PDF)
 ​
 If anyone has any suggestions for ways to just link up all of these apps and files that would be great. I'm also open to paying a little bit for any alternatives to any apps or ways to use our computers to make sure everything works flawless. Example, if its better to use Office 365 instead of Google etc I can change that. Thank you for any suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 Some weeks ago I discovered (maybe from a dashboard posted here?) ntopng: a self-hosted network monitor tool.
 Ideally these systems work by listening on a "mirrored port" on the switch, but mine doesn't have a mirrored port, so I configured the system in another way: ntopng listens on some packet-capture files grabbed as streams from my Fritz!Box.
 Since mirrored ports are very uncommon on home routers but Fritz!Boxes are quite popular, I've written a short post on my process, including all the needed configuration/docker-compose/etc, so if any of you has the same setup and wants to quickly try it out, you can within minutes :)
 Thinking it would be beneficial to the community, I posted it here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Synology 6 bay NAS with a 5 bay expander. I was thinking about what I would do when I max out my current setup.
 I was wondering if getting a 12 bay Synology would be the best option or should I look at going custom and using something like TrueNas or Unraid?
 I have a NUC with Ubuntu running Docker for Plex, Unifi, etc. 
 The thing I love about my Synology or any NAS is that it's small and is just a case for drives. They are also quiet and are pretty good with power consumption. And after spending all day working in IT, I don't want to spend hours and hours on setup and configuration. I love the ease of set up. With that said, I have built my own PC for 20 years so I'm no stranger to assembling hardware or setting up systems.
 Suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m slowly growing my homelab and I’m keeping everything private on my own network. This works great. I have a custom DNS record at the router level that I can use. I would like to start branching out and enabling https. However my understanding is that to get a cert from a CA this would require some of my information to be publicly exposed. I would like to avoid this. The only way I use my self hosted apps from my homelab are via my home network or by tunneling into my network via a vpn or tailscale. Any suggestions on how I can achieve this without exposing my info to the public?
 I understand that this might not be possible, but thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Version 0.16 of the free and open source web desktop Orb has been released. Orb simulates a Windows-like desktop in a web browser. You can use it to access files on a server or a NAS in an easy and secure way. It uses jQuery, Bootstrap and a PHP backend.
 With the release of the previous version, you asked for a code editor. So, a code editor is what you get. It's built with the Ace editor, so it has code highlighting, themes, auto indent, validation checks and other code editing stuff.
 This version also allows users to have their own static website and change their password.
 Download at Gitlab or try the online demo.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have about 30 services running on my small homeserver. When i access them from outside of my home network, i use my Wireguard VPN. None of the services is exposed to the internet at the moment.
 Now i would like expose some of my services (like Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Jellyseerr, Vaultwarden, ...), so that my family and some friends can use them without using a VPN on their devices.
 All my services are currently behind a Traefik Reverse Proxy. My initial idea was to use an IPWhiteList for all services that i don't want to be accessible from the internet, so that only local IP-adresses and the VPN subnet would be on the whitelist. I assume i could do something similar with Authelia and increase security a bit by using 2FA.
 What other tools or approaches (CrowdSec?, Fail2ban?, Cloudflare Tunnels?, ...) do you recommend when exposing a subnet of services to the public internet?

 my goal is to publish my home server (which mainly includes some applications running on docker compose)
 I have been researching about this topic and I came across few possibilities
  
Self hosted gateway (the issue is that tunnels are established for each application). I was not able to publish only my Nginx Proxy Manager which would route traffic towards local containers.
  
2)Netmaker... I wasn't really able to understand how it works
 3) Any easy method via Wireguard? Like a connection initiated from the client side (home server) towards a VPS?
 Note: I am aiming for a free open source self hosted solution (FOSS)
 Thanks

 Also, I've been looking at what UPS's are out there, however I'd like to know what your recommendations would be for this kind of small installation?
 Thanks and have a nice day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently use BoxCryptor to manage my files on a local NAS (Synology DS918+). Given Boxcryptor is shutting down since they have sold their tech assets to Dropbox, so I'm having to move to a new platform. I've got some prior experience with Cryptomator which has been OK, but not entirely positive - albeit it was a few years ago.
 Key considerations:
  
MacOS (M1) is my main machine and I would like good filesystem integration - I currently use Forklift alongside Finder.
 I only need remote access, no local mirroring, no sync. Ability to selectively mark files to be mirrored locally on my laptop would be a bonus.
 Approx 15tb data - files from 1kb to 25gb.
 Ability to search, see thumbnails, doc previews etc across the encrypted share.
 90% of my data will be on the Synology, but I will also use some remote cloud storage - integration with such services is a plus.
 Versioning and such a further plus.
  
In doing a bit of reading around the topic, it seems that installing something on the Synology itself is an option - for example, there seems to be a NextCloud docker image and I believe I can access Nextcloud via WebDav through Finder/Forklift. However similarly, I've not always had great performance with web-dav and I'm not sure if will let me index/search/preview files efficiently.
 Grateful for any suggestions. 
 I have a MountainDuck license should that be a relevant part of the solution.
 Thanks!

 filedriller walks a directory tree and identifies all regular files by type with siegfried. Furthermore it creates UUIDv4s, hash sums (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512 or blake2b-512), gathers some metadata and can check whether the file is in the NSRL.
 It is beta, it is open source, useful feedback welcome!

Some of the older 1080p videos were as large as 20GB+ which made me gasp when I compared them to the newer x265 ones which were only 3-5GB in size.
 While looking for major differences in quality, I didn't really notice anything drastic but I'm probably just not looking in the right places. I understand things like bitrate etc will be the main culprits here, but am I on the right track in believing that x265 can truly be this efficient when it comes to the ratio of file size / quality?
 If there are any handy guides / videos about this topic, I would really appreciate the links.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ive been googling around for more than an hour but am still not sure how to do this.
 I don’t really want to expose any of my services to the internet. Maybe someday I will, but for now only I use them and I would rather VPN in everytime instead of exposing anything to the outside.
 The main reason why I even want to setup a reverse proxy is because vaultwarden only works when I have one because it needs HTTPS. Also its great if all of my services use https, even if my only point of entry is my VPN and no one should be able to access them anyways. Don’t worry, I don’t plan on actually using vaultwarden until Im sure everything’s secure.
 But whenever I find guides or questions about making a local reverse proxy, people still talk about me needing a (bought) domain. Why do I still need one when I am local anyways? 
 I would like to do either of this, preferring the latter. 1. Enter my IP with the specific services port and just be redirected so https is used 2. Enter a domain like jellyfin.example.local and I get redirected to the ip:port for that specific subdomain. Surely it is possible to „make up“ a domain and tell whatever resolves domains at the lowest level to redirect this to a specific ip:port? Maybe this also isnt possible, thats why I am asking.
 Thanks in advance for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking for a FaaS (function-as-a-service, like AWS Lambda) to host on my home server, but I found the popular options to be either complex or require Kubernetes. So, I decided to make my own.
 This is in very initial stages. Currently, it only has a web interface (without authentication), which allows you to register functions and invoke them from the web UI (including providing input to it). There is a brief demo on the Github page. I have also included a docker-compose.yml to make it easier to try out. Also, I have only written 1 (example) function so far.
 Link: https://github.com/sparkymat/fundock
 I'd love for people to try it out and give me some feedback. Some of my top priorities currently include:
  
Add API for registering and invoking functions (authenticated using long-lived API tokens)
 Asynchronous execution (and post-execution web hook)
 Terminate containers after timeout
 Some form of concurrent execution limit
 Ability to disable/delete functions

 I'm was thinking of trying to find some mini-ITX motherboard (nothing in mind yet), but was wondering if any single-board computer, à la Raspberry Pi, would exist for such an use case on the market. Would you know of any company selling a single-board computer with built-in IPMI (remote power on/off, remote view, kb/m, mounting ISO / USD…)?
 Thanks,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone! I've been looking at buying a NAS for a while now, but now I'm thinking it would be more fun to build one.
 Usage would be mainly storage and cloud (eg. next-cloud) and some services (home assistant, docker containers, some VMs). Still don't know if Proxmox or TrueNAS scale as OS.
 I don't know what to choose for CPU and MB. What I was aiming for was to do everything at adequate performance but with an eye to energy consumption (Italy where energy is not free at all). Not a clear idea on the budget, mainly around 600/700 euros, lower the better.
 The only starting point was the case (Silverstone CS351), since is the only one with "small" size and hot-swap bays (which I'd like to have) that i found easily available, but anything better is welcomed.
 Thanks for the help!

 I was thinking of upgrading to one of those Kimsufi dedicated servers, either a E3-1231v3 or a E5-1620v2.
 Issue is, those CPUs don't have Quicksync. How much of a problem will that be for transcoding ? It's mostly 1/2 1080p streams at a time, usually h264 (since the i5 doesn't support h265).
 Would you advise against such cpu for this kind of tasks ?
 In the end i will be using Proxmox, with Deluge, the Arrsuite, mailcow and few more apps here and there.

 I'm currently using Tidal as my music app on my phone and my pc. I like it because it allows me to stream high quality music to my phone, my pc, and my car with android auto, and it allows me to chromecast to my smart speaker.
 What I don't like is its limited library. I would like to listen to my CD-ripped music.
 I would like to avoid to pay a monthly fee and instead buy CDs and high quality music online, like qobuz.
 So I was wondering if there is a server software to run on my Raspberry Pi 4, that allows me to play music the way I do with Tidal?
 I've found something interesting in "mStream", but it lacks of the chromecast functionality.
 Do you have any experience with this? What do you use for high quality music streaming?

 Container Nursery, this project helped me to achieve my requirement. Thanks to the community for all valuable suggestions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 I started building my homelab the way I can provision all stuff from one place.
 The part I am proud of:
 Right now I manage docker mule with ansible. Traefik and dashboard is autopopulated with labels ( homepage is great, ansible-nas is sometimes outdated but can be easily fixed ) . 
 Pihole works as conditional DNS in this setup to provide internal domain resolution for services (alongside with traefik as internal proxy too) 
 The part I am struggle with (right now): 
 I have to set up public hostname manually for every external service. (Via Cloudflare zero trust dashboard) Looking for a advice how to add those automagically. How to tell cloudflared docker container to push new services if needed. Or I got this idea wrong
 ​
 The part I have to have done in next iterations:
  
Populate pihole local dns automagically based on xxx_available_internally var in ansible-nas (this should not be that hard except for putting lot of code for every single service)
 Git gud with virtualisation idea (how to proper set up resources for VM because right now its by trial and mostly errors)
 Set up proxmox, and those VM's with code (I still trying to avoid rewrite everything to terraform) 
 Automate generating/provisioning api keys for services I would like to have widget in homepage dashboard 
 Prepare backup plan
 Publish code
 Add UPS and resolve hdd fan issue on host (HP Elitedesk 800 g2 mini 65w, i5-6500, 8GB, 512GB ssd)
 Think about android phones ignore DHCP settings for DNS (or maybe its just Brave browser)
  
​
 Idea of what I am trying to achieve?

 I’m trying to harden my home network and I heard one should scan there network from outside of your network, correct? How do you guys accomplish this? VPN? Virtual machine? I know something like Linode would work but just want to hear what you guys personally do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a "server" with about 30 TB of storage that is placed at my mom's house, that runs win11, and a plex server. I watch my content recently via Infuse on my Apple TV and everything is working well. But I kinda wanna remove plex from my setup, since it feels kinda redundant, and I don't like the way they are heading. 
 I'm somewhat tech savvy, but above all I just want my setup to be reliable and work all the time. Hence why I have gone with just win11 and plex, since that is something I find myself extremely comfortable with. 
 Do you guys have some suggestions on how I can improve my setup? Windows 11 tends to update from time to time and get stuck on the "setup screen" which causes some annoyance, and plex just feels redundant now and more like someone snooping on anything I do more than anything else since Infuse is serving the FE. Any answers or input is greatly appreciated

I have 384 GB of DDR4 2133p and 38 TB in a raid 10 configuration (2 RAID Array). It also has 56 threads at 3.6 GHZ. What's your guys's opinion on it? Oh BTW, I'm making it for my kids... they go to colleges across the country from each other and I figured them being able to still play with each other might make them not so home sick. So I'm thinking of making this an awesome, huge world with over 150 plugins/mods.... Does this sound cool to anyone else, or am I going for overkill?

Ideally I'd like to have a bitwarden (vaultwarden actually) instance, a nextcloud instance, and maybe 1-2 other things like that. How would I go about this? I've been trying for hours all day today to figure this out but I'm losing my shit since I do not ever deal w/ web stuff and hate it. 
 Note: I am quite an experienced programmer and know my way around Linux very well, but this shit is bonkers to me. So, please help me out! And yes, a docker container w/ nginx running on ports 80/443 (https please!) would be ideal. I also have a lot of ports forwarding to my home server, including 80 and 443. I have DNS records with cloudflare's free tier pointing to my home ip but it **never** goes to my damn server itself. It either fails or goes to the router's page. Thanks for the help/advice!!

When I fly to my destination, I may carry-on a drive case to mitigate the risk for some of the drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of getting a DL380 Gen 9 that I acquired set up to serve as my primary NAS (at least at my home).
 I spent some hours (re: many of them) messing around with it over the holiday weekend. I had pulled a Dell H710 that was flashed to IT mode to replace the janky HP Smart Array adapter but while it would see it as a device in the bios, I could never get it to actually boot from any drives connected to it. TrueNAS could see it and address the drives just fine, but would not boot after installation. Legacy or UEFI made no difference. I finally gave up, put the HP adapter back in, set it to 'HBA' mode (which is kind of a misnomer with that card), reinstalled TrueNAS Scale for the 4th time and proceeded to configure the machine.
 It works but the HP adapter doesn't pass SMART info to TruNAS, so I'd be reliant on notifications from the iLO in case one of the boot pool SSDs fail or whatnot. 
 Ye, I attempted to search for solutions for both the Dell LSI card and the HP 'HBA' but found nothing that seemed useful. Saw some posts about taping a couple of pins on the H710, but the symptom didn't match what I was experiencing. 
 Thinking I might want to find an actual LSI card that the HP bios will boot from then rebuild the OS before I start moving data to it. Just for peace of mind, familiarity, and centralized SMART notifications. I'd end up having 2 LSI cards, as in order to run the external JBOD I have a LSI SAS9200-8e to facilitate my capacity drives, which appears to be working fine, but I don't intend to boot from it (If I even could on this machine). 
 In the future I may slap some cheap SSDs into the 6 free SFF slots for a fast pool for VMs or whatever at some point, so having them all in a similar ecosystem might be easier down the road.

 Recently I was asked about a budget AI / ML workload, and decided to test it against some of my own lab GPUs. 
 I'll be adding more tests, and benchmarks over time, but below is a link to my website where I covered it. As well as the code I wrote to benchmark them. 
 Hopefully this helps someone out there. :-)

 Anything like that exist? What I envision is basically like a chat room except it's reddit posts, FB Marketplace posts and eBay posts. Have it running on a separate monitor, on the TV, while I take a shit, anywhere in the house if I like. Or even like a stock ticker display!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Kind of a mixed bag topic, but figured I'd ask - does anyone have recommendations for a mesh WiFi system (preferably WiFi 6/6e capable) that is friendly towards self hosters? What I mean by that is either DD-WRT can be installed on it, or the interface allows for an appropriate level of tweaking (opening/forwarding ports, DDNS, etc.)?
 Budget is up to $300 but can do more if a product absolutely ticks every box, coverage area is a 2-floor 2500 sqft house and a few wireless cameras on the corners of the house, and I'd not mind having a wired backhaul for each puck. Total device count right now is just shy of 50, with only 10 of those permanently wired and the rest WiFi. Device count may increase to as many as 75 once I replace some WiFi light bulbs and my girlfriend moves in with me in a few months.
 Some nice-to-haves would be:
  
Compatible with Let's Encrypt for SSL cert on the config page
 WAN accessibility, preferably not dependent on a proprietary app
 Can be configured for DDNS for the self-hosting aspect of things
 I wouldn't mind being able to further modify WiFi-specific settings - antenna-specific transmit power, encryption type (WPA3 would be awesome), etc.
 Guest network is cool, but not a strict requirement
  
I'm asking in this sub, as opposed to others, as I'm specifically seeking guidance on the customization/features that self hosters need from their network equipment.
 Appreciate any advice or feedback, thanks!

Can someone recommend a replacement solution please? I would prefer something smaller than a desktop and relatively quiet.

Any recommendations for a case that includes a hot-swap backplane for 10-12 HDDs? It can be big and ugly but I'd like to keep it under $200 if possible. Also I'll need an internal SATA expansion card too so a recommendation there would be appreciated (6 port).
 Current hardware:
  
Ryzen 5 1600
 MSI X470 Gaming Plus Max (6x SATA ports)
 32GB DDR4-3200
 GTX 1050 ti
 SATA: 8x 4TB, 1x 256GB SSD (cache drive)
 M.2 NVMe boot drive
  
The plan is to have the 8TB drives in a mergerfs + snapraid pool. I would also consider selling the CPU, mobo and GPU and switching to Intel QSV solution too which might be easier.
 Edit: Silverstone CS380B looks perfect but prices have gone waaayyy up. Was less than $140 a few years ago.

The connection is via the Red,yellow, white cables. The video is fidgeting and terrible quality when converting. I tried it on both a Mac and a PC with the same terrible quality.
 However, I plugged the camcorder directly into my TV with the RCA cables and the quality was excellent. Now the question is how do I get that good quality onto digital? I'm thinking the issue is that the quality is getting messed up going through the conversion device but when its directly on the tv its fine. 
 I'm thinking I need to find a dvd recording device to convert the tapes to dvd and then to digital? Want to get some help on if that's the right thinking and right next step?

The thing is humming along nicely and set up to serve my home, providing with 8TB ZFS backed storage which is, for now, plenty for my needs - all the initial data over the years amounts to ~3TB so I have some headroom still. This is mostly archival data - media, documents, etc. Things that I store once, I read every now and then and are never deleted. 
 Now I'm turning my attention to backup solutions. I have gone through the sub's wiki on the subject (great resource) and I have a few ideas of my own for local and offsite, but I'd be interested on what your particular set up is - whether you're using ZFS send/receive and into what, online storage and how you sync your data in there, costs. Whatever's working well for you I'm interested to know about.
 Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm having trouble getting this to work. Diagram here: https://imgur.com/xLMVzeE
 The goal is to use an old wifi router and use it so that all of my wifi cameras connect to it so that the cameras 1) Are isolated from my home network and 2) Have no internet connection.
 Some information about the set up:
  
Server is a laptop with two NICs
 Server runs Linux Mint
 I do not want to use VLANs
  
I did some digging and know that I should connect the secondary router's WAN to the server's NIC. However, I can't figure out how to access the router's login page (from the server) which probably means the server won't be able to access the RTSP streams either.
 There are a lot of network settings (DHCP etc.) on the server (Linux Mint) that I'm sure I have to set up but have no idea on how to do it. All of my Google searches aren't turning up with setups similar to mine.
 Can you help me?

 But, in the past I've read negative things about Oracle privacy-wise, and unlike Hetzner it is not based in the EU (the company not the servers). On Google Cloud I noticed once that it's possible to encrypt your VM with your own encryption keys. Does someone know if something like this is available with Oracle Cloud as well, I didn't quite find anything regarding this.

 Eg: how to map C:/Home/Users/Name/Pictures to map in piwigo so all my albums i can see in app and web interface. I have tried watching some videos on docker volume mounts but not getting hang of it yet.
 ​
 I am also looking at Immich as my backup self host software and its looking great.

 I'm curious of the following:
  
Is the Mac Pro 2013 a good choice for ESX? (I'm looking for something low-cost where I can upgrade the CPU and RAM)
 I want to run ESX 8. Anyone doing that successfully?
 How does OS support work? The Mac Pro 2013 doesn't support Ventura but if I virtualized it on it with ESX will the VM install\run?
 How loud is this trashcan going to sound?

 For the latter, I have everything set up over CloudFlare tunnels, so I can easily access them via, for example, https://radarr.example.com
 I am trying to get my Wordpress instance to work over tunnels. I want to be able to access Wordpress via, for example, www.example.com/wordpress. I tried tunnelling www.example.com to localhost:80 and this works, but only for the main Apache landing page (that is index.html in the root of my web server). Any Wordpress pages (using the sub folder of /wordpress) otherwise display a local IP rather than example.com/wordpress/some_page.php
 I think there is some nuance I am missing to get this to work. Any help would be much appreciated! Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a year since RH launched (relaunched) the Developer Susbscription. You get 16 prod servers for free + unlimited servers on RHEL Beta.
 Has anyone used this for Homelab? I'm in the midst of doing a rebuild, and am exploring distros to play with (nothing mission critical on my lab, can tear down and rebuild in a few hours if needed). 
 I like the Insights Portal and the auto patching and the general visibility into the servers thanks to RHEL's web portal. But it is a fair amount of mental overhead to learn the "RHEL way". 
 Is it worth investing the time to learn it for homelabbing? I don't need to learn this for my job or anything, so that's no motivation. 
 I'd like to hear from the community here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I get more into selfhosting I have replaced more and more of the Synology Apps I used to use with different selfhosted applications, which I either run directly on the Synology or in docker containers. I use the Synology Apps less and less.
 The positives I have is easy backups and general management of the server. I was thinking about buying another Synology solely as an off-site backup.
 But Im thinking, before I get even more entrenched in the Synology space, should I maybe just get these used enterprise servers or something like that and try to switch away from Synology?
 How hard is it to setup RAID, backup to another remote server, general management of the server, like firewall etc.?
 I am also thinking about upgradeability. I don’t know how much the enterprise servers are upgradeable, but I assume far better than Synologys, where you can only add RAM, and even that is limited.

 Hi guys,
 A bit of a newbie here, so bear with me.
 I'm currently running openvpn on my wrt router and it has been working just fine, but due to my needs of hosting a server at home and accessing it remotely, I have purchased a dedicated IP address from my VPN provider, but I am quite confused on how I am supposed to set it up, they literally only provided the IP address that was assigned to me, is that all I need to configure it? and if so, where do I plug it in, in my .ovpn file somewhere?
 Sorry if it's a dumb question but I cannot find any info on google, maybe I'm googling the wrong words. 
 Thanks in advance

 I read that avoiding 192.168.x.x altogether is a good idea? 
 What to use then? Something like 10.25.50.x? I also like 19.168.50.x but the avoiding 192.168. stops me, also 192.168 is also quite chaos.
 Edit: Thanks everyone! I chose 10.0.50.x, as it suits my purposes for now and is quite simple. If I decide to use VLANs or anything in the future I can expand easily.

 I am currently in India and have been waiting to get my hands on a Raspberry Pi 4 since over a year to starting my self-hosting journey. Sadly, they are never in stock or just been sold at double the normal price. So, I came across this piece of hardware which I found to be more worth than a Raspberry Pi in my country i.e Dell Optiplex 3040 - Core i3 6th gen 3.2ghz, 8 GB ram & 240gb SSD storage(Renewed). 
 The things I want to host:-
 -Bitwarden
 -Simplelogin
 -NextCloud
 -Notes
 -PiHole
 -PiVPN
 -5 single page static websites
 -And a few more things I'll come across in my self-hosting journey 
 I wanted to know If I could run those on the device mentioned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Soo... For a long time I was using my pc as a data storage but recently decided that it is time to get some new fancy NAS. My requirements were quite simple (as I thought): Plug-n-play box, 4 hard drives, 2 m2 slots, and can run Plex with hardware encoding. 
 After some research, I came to the conclusion that there is no simple solution for a reasonable price. 
 QNAP seems to collect all security breaches in the recent two years - no, thank you.
 Asustor offers good hardware but very mediocre soft. 
 Synology was the most promising among "big players" DS920 + looks good, but m2 can only be used for caching, fortunately, DS923+ has just been released. And it's worse than the previous model?? If I understand correctly, they made it possible to use m2 as storage but switched to Ryzen CPU without hardware encoding. Also, 1GbE ports in the 2023 model, just why? 
 Other Synology models that match my simple needs are in the 1k USD range, at this point I might as well say fuck the environment and keep my PC running 24/7 
 Please, share your wisdom, what is worth buying in 2023?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad is a hobbyist photographer for a long time and shot on film up until around 2011 so we have a load of physical photo albums, anything post 2011 was shot digitally and has been stored in my file servers. 
 We have an old Epson flatbed photo scanner but the results that it gave off weren't very good and would require a load of correcting on my part. I was wondering if I should buy a top load photo scanner and be very careful with pulling the photos out of the sleeves (as the plastic has become stuck to the photos) or is there a better way of doing it (i.e. a different type of scanner or a photo scanning service that you would recommend in the UK)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the year comes to a close, I'm curious to know which self-hosted apps Redditors have used the most in 2022 (excluding utility services like reverse proxies or something like Coolify, Dokku, Portainer). So more something like Nextcloud, Rocket.chat, Gitlab.
 For me, i think the five most important were (in alphabetical order) AdGuard Home, Mailcow, Onedev, Paperless, Plausible. They all have their own unique features and benefits. 
 Adguard: Adguard Home is a self-hosted ad blocker that can be used to block ads and tracking scripts on your home network. It works by acting as a local DNS server, which allows it to intercept and block requests to known ad and tracking servers before they reach your device. 
 Mailcow: Mailcow is a self-hosted mail server that provides a full-featured email solution for small to medium-sized organizations. It includes features such as spam and virus protection, and support for multiple domains. 
 Onedev: Onedev is a self-hosted Git repository management platform that includes features for code review, project management, and continuous integration. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.
 Paperless: Paperless is a self-hosted document management system that allows you to store, organize, and access your digital documents from anywhere. In 2022 the fork paperless-ngx was released. 
 Plausible: Plausible is a self-hosted web analytics platform that provides simple, privacy-friendly tracking for your website. It allows you to see how many people are visiting your site, where they are coming from, and which pages they are viewing.
 What about you? What are your top five self-hosted apps of the year? Were there new ones that you started using in 2022? Share your experiences with them and why you think they stand out from the rest.
 Edit: Forgot AdGuard Home, so swapped it for WordPress.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/homelab,
 Currently working entry level IT, but looking to practice with a homelab at home. I would like to create a lab to setup/have/learn pihole, plex, virtualization, azure, active directory, game server hosting, study for certifications etc. Here is a list of items I own/ ordered over boxing day:
 _
  
Router: ASUS Wireless AX5700 Dual-Band Wi-Fi 6 Router (RT-AX86S)
 TP-Link 8 Port Gigabit Easy Smart Switch (TL-SG108E)
 Dell OptiPlex 3050, Micro, 1x Intel Core i5 Quad (i5-7500T) 2.70 GHz, 16 GB, 500 GB, No Optical, Intel Integrated Graphics, 64-bit Windows 10 Home
 Raspberry Pi 4 - 4 or 8 gb ram (don't recall)
  
_ 
Items I got for free but unsure if it would work for my plans.
  
Orico 4 bay external hdd - https://www.amazon.ca/External-Enclosure-Support-Aluminum-Storage/dp/B07XL2BS53?th=1 Not quite the same, but close. No RAID button at the back. 
 
LaCie 2big Thunderbolt 2 - https://www.lacie.com/ca/en/support/raid/2big-thunderbolt-2/
 
 Main plan for now would be setting up the dell to run pihole and plex. Many posts about people running this in docker containers. Just trying to figure out how to set myself up. Reading many threads of people buying a newer NAS to run plex on directly. or using an older one to host to plex files and run it through the dell to transcode. 
 (Bought a cheap plex lifetime subscription a long time ago, finally had funds + time to start this endeavor.)
 Sorry for the rambling, just looking for some advice guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story is I have 3 docker swarm nodes with x.x.x.10 virtual ip across all notes using keepalived and x.x.x.11 x.x.x.12 x.x.x.13 static ip at each node. For services exposing web I am using traefik with port forwarding to x.x.x.10 All nodes also have glusterfs replicated storage, so I can take two nodes down and still have all services.
 Right now, all services or containers on overlay network expose ports on 0.0.0.0 which I want to limit for some applications to maybe another virtual ip using keepalived (e.g., x.x.x.18) or a specific node's ip like x.x.x.12
 The goal in mind is to leverage docker's overlay network but limit it to specific ip. Now that I am tying this out, I am having doubts whether this would even be supported or work properly. If a single virtual IP and a single container are running on different hosts, would docker even route traffic properly in that case?
 One use case that I would apply this is having two pihole replicas on different nodes, but come think of it, maybe running three replicates with each host LAN ip (.11 .12 .13) could work just as well

 I am a Network Engineer by trade however I have not had the luxury of playing around with physical routers or servers in person. I have also been a lurker and hoping to build my own lab. So I've bought my first component!
 I have just received my R620 (barebones, included fans and psu) however I'm looking at the specs and I can see that I can run an E5-2600 V1 or V2. My question is, How can I tell if I have the BIOS from V1 or V2? can I just buy a couple of V2 CPU's (If people have suggestions on a CPU aswell that would be greatly appreciated (Hoping to use it as a storage and virtualisation server)) and check the BIOS before I load it with an OS (probably UNRAID)?

 A lot of budget builds and suggestion for hardware I found were really focusing on power efficiency. However I don’t have to pay for the energy bills in my Appartement, so energy efficiency is no real factor for me. Does this open doors for new hardware? If yes, what would you suggest.
 Currently I have a RaspberryPi as a NAS but I had some troubles with dust coming into my USB ports and I want 10 Gbit connectivity in my next NAS. Also upgradability is not really given in my opinion.

 The constant spin up causes serious performance issues when trying to work from it.
 It does not respect Windows power plan, 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power' in Device Manager is disabled by default and the WD Elements is not supported by the WD utility.
 To keep it awake I resorted to using a script to touch an empty file every 20 seconds. But this workaround is a bit hacky, not to mention it is still a problem when using the drive somewhere else.
 Is there any hope to disabling the aggressive hardware sleep on this thing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I picked up some SanDisk non-Dell branded SSD's over on homelabsales with 97 - 100% life left on them for a good deal. I have a R730xd with a PERC H730P Mini RAID controller. I can make the drives non-RAID drives via Dell's management software and the SanDisk software is able to see the drives, read SMART data, and update firmware. However, the Dell management software or the OS still doesn't appear to get the SMART data. Plus, I would like to put some of these drives in a RAID array.
 What are my options to try and accomplish this? I've read the H330 controllers can be flashed into IT mode, but I don't believe that will allow me to create a RAID array.
 Any thoughts or suggestions is appreciated.
 Thanks!

 Now I bought the WM14NS40 with the UGreen 12v Sata to USB 3 adapter. Reviews from Amazon says it should work but its Amazon. I also 3D Printed a case in PETG.
 ​
 Issues I've been having:
 Drive not showing up at all,
 Drive showing up but crashing the file explorer which then makes Windows completely unstable until reboot,
 Drive working and plays 2 seconds of a CD and unable to play Blu-rays.
 ​
 I've downloaded the latest firmware from LG but it was already at the latest.
 In Device Manager it says it using the driver cdrom.sys Version 10.0.19041.1266.
 I done some search of people having the same issues but they never say what IS the problem.
 Now I'm just hoping you guys will know anything about this to point me to another subreddit that may know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm planning to add 10G to my lab. For now, it's going to be a point-to-point connection specifically for MPI. It's what I call a JoJa-class cluster - it's bizarre, and it's an adventure to get it working. I'm thinking about two options: good ol' copper (like cat6) and fiber in the form of SFP+ - SFP+ cable (i.e. with already attached transceivers). The first option seems somewhat easier, but I'm worried about possible EMI and, therefore, higher latency. The second one seems more solid, but I've never worked with fiber before.
 Are my worries unfounded? Should I go with the fiber option?
 P.S. The "cluster" consists of two nodes: Intel i7-12700K with 128 GB DDR4-3600, and AMD Ryzen 7950x with 128 GB DDR5-4000, both running NixOS. Curiously, their performance per hyperthread is pretty close.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've currently got a Dell MD1200 (12 LFF drivebays). I'm using it with shucked WD drives.
 To reduce power consumption I've removed one of the EM modules as there no benefit to having it powered as all the drives are SATA and I don't need to split the enclosure. However the enclosure is still power hungry (even with all the drives removed).
 On top of this it appears to have an intermittent fault, or at least it thinks it does. Every few minutes it'll turn the status LED orange and ramp the fans up to 100% before slowing the fans down and going back to blue. However I can't see any errors in any logs and the drives are all fully accessible.
 I'm therefore thinking it might be time to replace it with something else, but I'm not sure what.
 Does anyone have any suggestions for an external enclosure that will take at least 12 x 3.5" SATA drives and is available in the UK.

Photos, videos, games, music, shows, Wikipedia other sites I deem valuable tools. However I am wanting to upgrade to something more modern. 
 I am considering making a new Nas borderline just a server. Because I want to segment it with a few vm's to hoast things like websites and email etc but I am unsure what to use (hardware) to meet these desired goals. I would like to use plex with it for my media locally but im not seeing a solution with a high core/thread count and it being viable with plex. I only need plex to stream steadily at 1080p ideally but 720 will do. Any suggestions to look at would be great.

 Here's what I am looking for:
 I have 3-4 email boxes which receive emails which I would like to assign a ticket number to and have an agent accept responsibility for the ticket and then have a thread between the user and the agent about said ticket number. It would be nice if these were able to be archived. Currently I am using a shared inbox and each of the current agents have their own email boxes. A website chat widget would be a huge bonus. 
 Something self hosted would be nice but Id be open to something freeium if need be. Just curious if someone could give me insight on a similar situation and what the setup looks like etc. 
 Thanks!

 They are sold with a 3-year warranty from MD TECH INC. They do not appear to have a website, however their support email "cs@mdtechusa.com" appears to be valid and uses Microsoft Outlook for their MX servers. 
 diskprices is labeling these drives as "new." I'm not sure why, because the amazon page makes no such claims. While they don't explicitly state that their drives are refurbished, the fact that they don't call them new should give credit to the claims that they are refurbished drives. 
 I decided to buy one, because my data is unimportant and easily replaceable. 
 The drive came in a box, which was inside an amazon bag. Inside of the box, the only protection for the drive are two thin HDPE plastic molding on either end of the drive. Pic 1, Pic 2 Edit: The drive was in an anti-static bag.
 Here is the smart data for the drive, with 10 Decimal values.
 Here is a benchmark of the drive.
 Let me know if there's any other information you'd like about the drive and i'll do my best to provide it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for help / suggestions on how to actually mount pcie cards which are plugged into m2 risers such as the attached image...
 The issue is, 
 A) when I put it in the closest m2 slot on the MB the card does not fit (the pcie is not as recessed as the real slots and so the bracket can't be screwed in.
 B) when I use a more out of the way M2 slot the riser cable is so rigid... It may be possible to do some really slick tri-folds... But it doesn't seem right off the bat.
 C) when I think of using the closest m2 with a vertical riser then I have to move two other cards to vertical risers also which they get all fumbly and interfere with each other..
 Perhaps there exists some sort of 3D printable bracket that pulls the card back off the motherboard a bit to accomodate a fold or bulk of a riser or the amount of lift from the M2 card... But what are you all doing to get these to fit??
 PS. My case is Thermaltake P3 and my MB is MSI z690 Tomahawk DDR4. There are 3 x16 on the board but last one operates only at x1. I've got a gpu, TB4, card and a 10g SFP. Which is why I need to use one of the M2 which is pcie4x4.

 I'm still running my first NAS built in 2008 which at the time was built off Windows Home Server. Over time as that no longer became supported, I upgraded to Windows 10 using Storage Spaces as an easy to use redundancy option for my drives. I backup my NAS every few months to an offline external drive and this strategy has worked well over the years. I've barely had to touch my NAS for many years.
 I'm slowly trying to ween myself off the comfort of a Windows based NAS, and have been playing with the Linux options. Hoping to get steered in the right direction based on my requirements:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am looking into different self hosted chat options. I'm gonna share my story here a bit to explain what my community is looking for. 
 ​
 We are a huge Roleplay community. Roleplay means, multiple accounts and profiles for the characters and identities my users use. 
 Currently we use XenForo. It's amazing, we don't use the forum part we just use an addon they have called Chat by Siropu 2. everything works great but we have a lot of complaints that it's not that good on mobile. and theres no app either. they have to get on a browser and visit the site. 
 ​
 We tried Discord. but many of our users get locked out after they have 5-10 accounts for their characters because discord begins asking for phone numbers etc. 
 ​
 we moved to Rocket chat hosted in a site called cloud jiffy. worked well but we were paying $50 a month and 1 day.......the whole chat just vanished. so we went back to Xenforo. 
 ​
 We've now found Virola chat. This service is PERFECT because we admins can create as many user profiles and accounts as we want directly from the admin panel and hand over the login to our roleplayers. https://virola.io/
 there's also an app for the phones which makes things a lot better. 
 however where should I host this? what host do you recommend? we are about 9 or 10 REAL people with around 60-70 profiles/accounts in total inside the chat, so it's not like in Real people we're a ton and need a ton of resources for a server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I've been testing and watching NextCloud for a while. I see that it brings a LOT of benefits(you can have your own google suit with 100% of privacy and it's FREE!) but I always had an issue with NextCloud being so slow.
 After trying several setups (apache + php fpm, nginx + php fpm and openlitespeed with lsphp) I think I found the fastest way to host and to use NextCloud. I made a guide step-by-step that is free and you can check it right now: https://theselfhosting.art/how-to-setup-the-fastest-nextcloud-ever-on-debian-11/ 
 Benefits of this setup:
  
The webserver virtual host and php for NextCloud are running on a low permission user. That means that even if your server gets hacked for some reason, your server is still fine since they can't touch the root user.
 LSPHP seems to be faster than php-fpm by default and we are using it.
 APCU and redis are being used to boost the performance to the best
 Debian 11 was used to stability and security
 I show you how to easily use occ commands with this setup in the end
 This guide is 100% free.
 I doubt that you will ever find a faster NextCloud. I feel that this setup may be faster than some managed NC hosts out there
  
Hope you enjoy it. Feel free to ask me any questions here or on the comments section :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi!
 So, currently I have 2x4TB on a mirrored ZFS pool but I need more space. I'm just not sure where to go from here. I could get another 4TB drive and go for raidz1 but is that a good idea? Should I just get two and mirror it? Or is raidz1 enough with a good backup? I currently only backup super important data encrypted to cloud storage (Hetzner Storage Box) but haven't thought about a good backup for all the data. raidz1 doesn't seem to have a good reputation but I'm not sure how warranted that is for data that is mostly blurays where I have the physical disk anyway.
 So, do I get 1 extra disk for ~7TB storage and one disk for parity and a large external drive for nightly backups? Do I get two for stripped and mirrored? I'm not really sure...
 BTW the two disks I have are SRM. I read about the SRM/CRM WD Red thing too late. The new disk(s) would be CRM. There have not been any issues writing data yet. So I thought about just replacing the two SRM drives with 2 8TB crm drives but that seems like a dumb financial decision...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a member of an online-only Dungeons and Dragons group. We - the players - need to organize our campaign notes in a searchable, categorized, and user-friendly way. 
 Currently I store all of my own notes in Vimwiki, and another player uses Notepad. A third won't take notes at all as it's too much work. 
 I've considered things like mediaWiki but that seems like a lot. I've looked at Joplin, but, again, a lot. Again, I discounted these almost entirely because they seem like way too much for what I'm trying to do. I'm still willing to consider them if there's a good reason to.
 I'd ideally like something that:
  
can be reverse proxied
 only requires one container
 either supports multiple users or has no concept of users
 has a dark more or Dark Reader doesn't make it look terrible
 has edit history
 has multiple pages/categories/something; one page per area in the campaign or something
  
In a perfect world it would fit all these criteria, but I think I'd bargain down to it fitting three.
 Any ideas?

 Pi-Hole doesn’t play nice with Pop!_OS, so I’m switching to Ubuntu Server.
 NextCloud and Plex storage will be on an external array once I get the funding together.
 I’ve heard that Pi-Hole can have issues in a container, so I may just run it bare.
 If any Linux admins here have any tips, tricks, or best practices to follow to help make setting things up as smooth and easy as possible, I’d appreciate it! 
 I’m a little fuzzy on migrating the Homebridge and Home Assistant containers, but I welcome any useful suggestions!

 I have been noticing some issues with my plex server and decided to run some tests on all my equipment. I was checking the status of my HDD, and I first used Crystal disk info, which gave me a caution message, I then downloaded the Western Digital Dashboard, and it says it's healthy, I then ran an extensive 6+ hour smart test, and no errors came up. This left me needing clarification and guidance and wondering what program to trust. I later found out about HD Tune and tried that, and it matches what Crystal Disk stated. Is it safe to say I have a dying HDD? It is still under warranty, so I am considering claiming an RMA and shipping it out. What do you all think I should do?

 This is the health status from the Western Digital Dashboard

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 I am running a small Docker Swarm with 4 RPi. I really love all the services I am able to run at home.
 But I have encountered some issues in the past and today as well. But I didn't understand exactly what the issue is.
 I have a Synology NAS and a NFSv4 Share which is mounted on each RPi. Usually I create BIND mounts when I set up a service. I had this issue with Nextcloud and today with a Ghost container: During preparation phase, I checked the logs and always found: "changing ownership: permission denied" for the BIND mounts I've defined.
 Can someone explain me what's the issue here? 
 Big THX!

 Does anyone know of an alternative that I could use self-hosted? I'd also be willing to explore a way for a server like Cleavr to connect to my internal server.. I setup Cloudflare tunnel at first and then remembered that it doesn't support inbound connections through SSH hahah

 After reading all the horror story posts on here of people having services exposed to the internet and waking up to a ransomware encrypted NAS I closed off my entire lab to the internet and now use Tailscale more or less exclusively to access servers. It works great, but it's not perfect - particularly, the iOS app uses a ton of battery.
 My ideal setup would be to expose a single SSL reverse proxy that requires Google auth. That would not only allow secure remote access without Tailscale
 Feels possible - has anyone made this work?

 Is that really necessary?
 I would want to register with my e-mail and password then checkout with Paypal. I do donate from time to time to open source devs for their hard work, but this is just ridiculous.
 Maybe I missed something like a legal obligation in the country they operate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing some reading on this subreddit and a couple other subreddits trying to iron out my data/backup solutions for the new year. I found a few trails of thinking that backing up to a single disk, primarily an external is nearly, or if not worse, than not at all. This is stemmed from the idea of data corruption, mainly, by not having a filesystem like ZFS or BTRFS with checksumming in an array to fix bitrot, coupled with potential problems with USB devices. 
 While I'm sure there may be more wiggle room, and it probably is fine to have a couple extra backup drives (cold storage etc) as single disk/USB, but if you're main backup device is USB, it does start to make sense. 
 For instance, I've got a Synology 1621+ with 4 disks in an SHR1 array, with BTRFS and checksumming, cool. That device is used as my centralized datastore, so I should back it up locally, at least the data that I care about losing. I would need, at least, another two disks to have an array with parity and a checksumming filesystem for this to be a valid local backup (not just cold storage, but automated local backup). This doesn't take into account the offsite backup. 
 It also brings up another topic for me is cloud solutions, and maybe leaning on them a bit more due to the natural resiliency and such to make sure bitrot doesn't occur. This could be fed back into my local solution, and then backed up offsite to a more archival solution. 
 Does anyone have any insight or suggestions for this so I can actually start making headway?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says I have a private CA and I want to use a reverse proxy to access all my services within my own network, I don't mind using any reverse proxy.
 I don't know if I need to provide any other info but if there's anything else then you guys can ask me and I'll reply.
 I'm sorry if I'm mixing up proxy and reverse proxy because I'm not really well versed with the difference between them

 Homepage is https://silverbullet.md that also doubles as a test instance.
 It is a markdown system, sort of a wiki, that can be edited live.
 What in my opinion sets it apart is the possibility to do some nice and structured queries on the content, like "list all the open tasks I have in all my notes".
 Reminds me of org.mode in emacs.
 Can be selfhosted easily (through docker) and is really lightweight.

 I would like it to have a bank of knowledge, for example say I downloaded a Wikipedia article bundle on biology, I could a say "computer, what is the purpose of RNA". I would also like it to do normal functions like calling people, setting reminders etc
 How would one set something like this up with minimal effort (I don't have extensive knowledge on coding so I don't think I could code one from scratch) on my phone? Perhaps something like this already exists?

Right now I am pushing to S3 all of my grandpa’s documents, he has a lot of them as he takes pictures and writes history books. I’m visiting him for the holidays and I thought it would be good to do a backup of his computer. I also thought it would be good to share this idea with you, my fellow hoarders. So do a good deed and help your family with our passion :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I'm releasing MinMon v0.3.1. I used some of the feedback I got from you guys (thanks!) for the first release not too long ago.\ Contributions and feedback are very welcome!
 There are two new checks: - PressureAverage which checks Linux Pressure Stall Information (PSI) for CPU, I/O, and memory. - ProcessExitStatus which runs a process and checks its exit status code. This gives a lot of flexibility to implement custom checks. 
 There are a few incompatible changes: - The default value for "memory" in the MemoryUsage check config was changed from true to false. - The placeholder alarm_id has been renamed to check_id for more consistent naming.
 Happy holidays!

I’ve never used a tape library so I figured it would be fun to learn on for the price, and maybe if I’m lucky upgrade the drive to a newer version. It’s a Tandberg Storage Magnum 2x24, holding 24 tapes for a whopping ~10TB active storage, now all it needs is a good clean. :)

 Has somebody successfully used a >2TB drive?

I'm honestly not sure if this is something I can pull off to be quite honest. For several years I've been running a few things on a Synology NAS (DS920+). Basically right now I'm running Jellyfin and Omada controller in Docker on the Synology. I've read a lot of interesting stuff about other stuff like Proxmox. I got some crazy idea I wanted to do that so I got a Dell T5810 workstation with a 24c/48t processor and (so far) 64 GB RAM. The DS920+ is getting re-homed so what I want to do is use my old Synology, the DS413, as network storage with my T5810 running Proxmox. So far I think I have it set up properly with I think its called NFS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, hi everyone. I have only today stumbled across your beautiful subreddit and have already spent hours on it. This is a Christmas gift in itself. I am absolutely going to implement this 3-2-1 storage method, but before I do:
 I have had a query (title) for years and it is getting to the stage where my devices are dying and I NEED a solution.
 I have attempted to transfer images and videos from an iPhone to a USB stick via a laptop before in the past but when transferring from an iPhone to a Windows laptop I noticed some videos/images were left out, despite me standing over the transfer for HOURS. Does anybody have a tried and trusted solution for this situation? If it works for this, it will probably work for all my other files stored locally on my laptop too.
 This will be for cold storage. I have read that HDDs perform better than USBs for this, is anybody able to verify that?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically want 1 machine with virtualization to run about 5 or so VMs. My old virtual lab Windows Pro w Hyper V tower is pretty old and noisy, and probably too outdated at about 10 years old. My daily machine is now a MacBook pro m1 with 8GB RAM, so not a lot of room for VMs there.
 Want one machine, don't want to get into a lot of equipment. Don't want it to be "always on", and don't care about HA. Prefer quiet hardware as I would probably put it in my home office. I could put something in my basement but I imagine it would be a hassle turning it on remotely, since I don't want always on. Most familiar with Windows Hyper V or VMware, but am open to other options.
 Reason for lab is to test ansible/Jenkins/terraform (among others) development to Windows and Linux guests (VMs), and also some Active Directory too. 
 Does someone have a similar setup, or any general suggestions of how to spec out something like this, what the options are?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys - Looking to upgrade the core switch in my network. Needs to be one single switch that has decent fan curves so my wife doesn't go crazy (1U is the only space we have in our closet).
  
Need at least 8x mgig 2.5/5/10 Gbps ports that support POE (POE for Wifi6E APs)
 Need at least 8x 1GbaseT ports that support POE
 4x SFP+ ports (uplink to 10G router and servers)
 2x QSFP+ ports (not required but would be nice for upgradability)
  
Right now the only one I've found is the Meraki MS355 but the licensing fees really turn me off. The product stops switching if the license expires and I'm unsure of the fan noise.
 I believe Cisco has variants in the 9300 series but I'm very nervous about the fan noise.
 Any other recommendations?
 Thank you

I am new to actual servers because I usually just use old PCS, but I recently got an R220 server off eBay. This server will sometimes randomly restart and will sometimes randomly power off. The memory scans good with memtest and all other hardware appears to be okay. The weird thing is that I don't think it is actually shutting windows itself down. I left a notepad file up on the server as a test to see when it shuts down, but when I power the server back up the notepad file was still open. I also don't see anything in event viewer. It looks like it is maintaining the last OS state somehow. Through Googling I found out that it might be related to iDrac, but I don't know enough about what that is to know for sure. I did go ahead and update iDrac and the BIOS though and that didn't fix it. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i've had my gaming laptop for a couple years now. after losing my mod folder for one of my favorite games (~16GB) last year, i began keeping a backup on my second internal ssd. i recently scored a surprisingly cheap pre-built gaming desktop and finally got around to transferring my mods over there.
 a small problem i encountered was my flash drive was slightly too small to move the now 28.6GB folder. i have a second flash drive handy so i just split the folder in half to complete the transfer. this has now lead me down a small rabbit hole of trying to find a convenient way of both keeping the folders on both PCs identical while also having a backup not connected to either. 
 i have an old 120GB ssd that i think still works. in the morning i plan to run to best buy and acquire either an enclosure or a sata-usb adapter cable or dock to utilize this ssd as a short term transfer/backup drive. 
 moving forward, i'd like a better setup for backing up and transferring all my game files as needed. not overly fond of using a NAS as it seems overly expensive and and honestly overkill for my use case (plus i'd rather not have to keep it powered). i'm leaning towards a few cheap SSDs, possibly setup to be exclusive to specific games or genres.
 both computers have 1.5TB of internal storage (all NVME in the laptop, 500GB NVME and 1TB HDD in the desktop) which is also a limiting factor (steam library is currently closer to 2TB, and i plan on buying a few more large games when i get paid on friday). i'd ideally like to be able to play some of the smaller, less demanding games straight off the external drives (more minecraft and goat simulator, less skyrim and GTA5). 
 what do you experienced hoarders recommend?

 I have a 250$ budget including drives ( I don't think i need more than 1 or maybe 2tb). I would be nice if it was small and energy efficient.
 Do you guys have any recommendations of what to buy?

A week or so ago, I purchased an ORICO two bay USB 3 external HDD enclosure to house two 8TB WD Red Plus NAS hard drives. I had the drive bay connected to my HP ProDesk 600 G2, and then setup as a RAID 0 array via mdadm. That idea worked fine, and I was pretty happy with things. The ProDesk works perfectly fine for what I want out of a little home server, and I figured connecting some HD's via an external drive bay and creating my own little NAS storage setup would be more interesting and co…]]></summary>

 I'm hoping to buy on Amazon, probably just 32 or 64 gb. Is there anything I should pay attention to for looking for a new USB? Any types that are maybe a bit faster and reliable without being too expensive?

 I am referencing this recommendation .
 I ran the following:
 journalctl -b 0 | grep renamed 
 And it states that "....enp3s0: renamed from eth0"
 What do I need to type in order to get the correct namesso that my ethernet will work again?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon, I've been reading a lot of posts here and want to keep to the 3-2-1 rule, especially as I've had a recent scare trying to hunt down data that was stored on an account that was deleted a while ago. I have 2 forms of local storage (my 1TB Windows 10 laptop and 2TB external WD easy store drive) but am now trying to figure out a good cloud solution.
 I don't have a clear estimate on how much I plan to store online, but I think around 40 GB or more might be a good approximate. I do care about my privacy though, and understand that no cloud based storage can offer me true privacy so I would need to encrypt my files before uploading. I've heard of mega.io , google drive, and tarsnap. I'd like to stay away from drive for obvious reasons.
 My question is, what is a good cloud based service for the (relatively) small amount of data I want to back up that gives me options if I want to scale up in the future, and what encryption programs should I download to encrypt my files before I upload them. Thank you.

 I have minio running perfectly fine on my home server, and would like to setup my grandparents and parents PCs to backup to my home minio. 
 Is there any good, easy to use utility for windows that would allow backup to minio? I am a good distance away and something that can run in the background would give me peace of mind for their data. 
 The minio/unraid server is also backed up to cloud. So 3 separate locations should mean the data is fairly safe from loss. 
 Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Apologies in advance if this is not the right place to post.
 Tl;dr: how to compare low consumption chips? How does a Via vx855 or vx900 compare to a Marvell ARMADA PXA 510 v7? 
 I'm only getting started with self-hosting, etc and after trying to get a rpi, I read a few posts around here recommending a thin client instead, which could potentially be cheaper, more efficient and at least as powerful (if not more) than a pi3.
 For info, my intention is to set a very simple home server so I can automate backup of my several devices, potentially self hosting nextcloud or equivalent.
 Now, my question: after reading a few posts, I went and bought off ebay (I'm in the UK in case that matters) a wyse 3010 (T10). I think it's this: https://www.wysechoice.co.uk/epages/BT4858.mobile/en_GB/?ObjectID=18010786
 Now, I haven't tested yet (Christmas and all that...) but I realised (too late, maybe?) that it's a 32bit processor, and the wyse comes without any flash storage! I know I can install Linux in a pen-drive so that's not an issue, but using the internal flash memory would be a nice addition.
 On the other hand, looking a bit more on ebay, I've found a few igel m310/320/330 for a reasonable price. They come with a chip Via Eden x2 (vx855 or vx900). All this info i found in parkytowers, which is extremely helpful but also a huge rabbit hole... And now I don't know anything anymore!
 In brief: how does a Via vx855 or vx900 compare to a Marvell ARMADA PXA 510 v7? How do these compare to an Atom e3815?
 Again, sorry if this is the wrong place to post (or the wrong way to ask!) and thanks in advance for reading and helping out!
 Ps: and merry christmas/happy new year if you celebrate in any way ;)

 Right Now, I have 2 nas servers in my current PC which I download and organize all my media and when I am done, and have everything set up right, I use my old laptop with 2 docks plugged in with 4 drives.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if 1TB Western Digital SA510 SSD’s would work or should I spend the extra money on SSD’s that are made for NAS use (such as the WD SA500)?
 The WD SA510’s are about 45$ cheaper (here in Canada) than the WD SA500’s. Is the extra cost worth it in the long run? 
 I plan to use Raid 10, starting with 6 SSD’s. My NAS has 10G networking, and is mostly used for media storage. 
 Thanks in advance!

 Basically, all im looking for is a simple web app that i can configure commands for that i can run in my local network so when my partner yells "IS PLEX DOWN?!?!", they can just hit a button to send a "docker container plex restart" command to my server.
 I can probably achieve this in home assistant, but I'm trying to avoid that. I'd prefer a standalone solution of some sort.
 EDIT: Resolved. OliveTin worked perfectly and its already up and running. Took about 30 minutes to going. Thanks again to /u/alphafalcon

 I installed Turnkey-core in Proxmox on a Dell server and then installed Docker and Portainer. So far so good. Only thing I don't really get is how volumes work in Portainer. So let's say I install Qbittorrent and I want it to download everything to a NFS folder on my NAS, do I have to mount that folder in Turnkey? Or do I have to add that volume in Portainer? Or do I have to do both? Please help me on this.

But I am willing to pay and as an investment for my own personal learning and development server. In the long run. I know it will be less hassle to run a cluster server and it might even be cheaper but I’ll not learn anything but their own version of the tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in my mid 30's so I had my fair share of dealing with CD's back in the day. But In my mind optical media seemed to have become a completely obsolete technology by now. So I was surprised to learn about M-disc when a someone on this sub brought it to my attention as a means to archive data. 
 And it turns out that it's the only way to archive data in a way that's legitimately durable long term and immune to bitrot. The second best would be LTO Tape drives. But the drives are really expensive and then the tech is still inherently not immune to bit rot, just less so that hhd and ssd and has a shelf life of about 30 years compared to the 1000 of M-Disc. 
 So M-Disc is for anyone that wants to archive data in the most straight forward way. As in put you data on some medium that you can store away and know for a fact that some process of degradation wont be destroying it. No other storage medium can make a claim that comes even close to M-Discs durability and projected life expectancy. M-Disc literally engraves on a rock like layer so not that different from the Assyrian clay tablets that we still have from over 1000 years ago.

 ​
 I'm looking for a selfhosted Windows or Linux service that includes a web-based GUI and supports CD-ROM playback. I looked up Volumio however many people have had issues with it being a bit buggy and it is also requires a paid subscription to support CD playback. Preferably with Airplay support so I could stream lossless to my speakers through a DAC plugged into the streaming machine.
 ​
 Hardware at my disposal is:
 Dell Thin client with a Celeron, 2GB RAM and 4GB eMMC storage.
 Or a Late 2014 Mac Mini that is already running Windows in bootcamp, due to it being used as a low-power personal Minecraft server machine through AMP instance manager.
 ​
 Any suggestions? Anything I've found is usually Raspberry Pi - ARM based, and I don't have a spare one on hand, all of them are running their duties already.

 Download Book -> Edit embeded metadata in Epub -> Send to Kavita
 As far as I know, currently there are 3 programs that can edit the metadata of an epub file. Readarr, Lazylibrarian, Calibre. I want to use Calibre but I think the the GUI looks not great and can be a pain to work with.

 I would like to to create a self signed CA to sign certificates for websites on my local network only as for anything outside is behind my reverse proxy with Lets encrypt certbot. The problem is if i import my self signed certificate on Win11 machine all browsers return that website has no trusted certificate. Am i doing it wrong or is there some sort of trick to this? Certificates/CA generation is a bit confusing for me from the technical side of things. 
 Is there a tool that would help me generate a CA/self signed ssl certificates and import them or do i need to do everything by hand?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm building an app to manage some files, and I've determined it makes the best sense to use object storage.
 I would like to host internally on my home k8s cluster to start/while I'm developing, using my NFS NAS as the actual storage backend.
 Are there any self-hostable solutions out there that can slap an S3 API in front of some NFS? Minio seems really heavyweight for my use case, plus they explicitly don't support network filesystem backends. The only other potential solution I've found is Zenko Cloudserver, and frankly, it looks like a development mess. 
 Would appreciate any insight if anybody has discovered other solutions.
 //edit: to clarify, when I say simple, ideally I’m looking for something that just maps the API to files on the filesystem. Minio is great, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t need the whole HA/duplication/everything else it provides for my local needs. I just need to be able to make API calls and retrieve files. 
 Thanks!

 With this I'm hoping to give the reader a complete collection of WH books in their best available format and somehow well sorted.
 If you enjoyed this and found some issues such as typos, bad scans/conversions, misplaced books and pretty much anything please send me a message.
 Lastly a huge thanks goes to all the people that helped out with this project. Thank you!

 I'm going through my spare parts bins and junk that I have access to, and have come up with this so far:

 i7 920 CPU -or- Xeon x5690 (probably go with the X5690)
 24Gb matching GSkill Ripjaw DDR3 1600 RAM (not ecc obvs)
 big ATX case
 I took an ancient Geforce GTX 480 off the mobo, and have several smaller GPUs to use, MUCH less power consumption than this GTX480. Surprisingly the GTX480 works great, but its a power hog for sure! I suppose I could easily go headless, once the server is up and running anyway.
 I'm hoping to do something you all probably think is simple enough, but I'm new to this stuff.
 I'd like to run Proxmox - virtualization is cool. I've loaded it once or twice on a few SSDs I've got, and just getting used to it a bit. I'm not sure how but Pro…]]></summary>

 I know that you can't increase quality by converting a lossy file to a lossless file, but can you prevent it from losing any more quality? These are sentimental files and I'm wondering if they'd be better preserved as .flacs

 It's been four years since I made this post, where I acquired a drive holding a 2014 dump of animemusicvdieos.org including an export of it's database. I'm gonna be honest here... It's collected dust since. I've made a few attempts to upload it to Archive.org via FTP but I just get errors. Tried different PCs and FTP clients, I start getting hung transfers and it all goes to hell. This is a huge amount of data so it's not like I can just toss it on Gdrive.
 So I'm looking for other people who can help. People I can send this data too and hopefully they can upload to archive.org and share by other means if they want. This drive won't function forever, I really need to get around to duplicating it's contents and propagating it across the internet and into other individual's collections.
 Ideas?

 I like to just go to google drive and drag all the files into a folder and let them upload. Problem is, there are many. When I do this, google never asks me if I want to replace the files or whatever. It always just reuploads the files that already exist and adds a number to the end of the name.
 Is there any way to stop this so that it does not upload file with the same name?

 What do you think, is it worth it and do I have to worry about security?
 I know a lot about securing Linux servers, so I think I'm relatively safe, but what do you think?
 Where should I host, can you recommend a secure hoster that is also trustworthy?
 I am currently thinking about using Hetzner, Ionos or AWS.
 If possible the hoster should be located in Germany.

 So I have Jellyfin and Tailscale installed on my home desktop. I also have Tailscale installed on a Google Compute Free Tier VM and have enabled it as subnet router. The home machine with Jellyfin installed is set as an exit node. I am able to ping my Google VM Tailscale IP from home machine and ping home machine from the VM.
 My question is, how do I access Jellyfin through the internet using my VM? Basically, I want to access without using Tailscale client(because there may be instances where I cant install the client on a device)..
 I have verified I can access my Jellyfin server through other devices on my home LAN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got ESXI 6.7 running on a dell precision T5600 (Dual Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2690) that has the onboard SAS port / controller. I have a 1 TB 2.5 inch SSD as the boot drive for ESXI 6.7 and a 2 TB HDD for VMs. I've recently installed an ICY DOCK Tray-Less 4 x 2.5 SATA HDD Hot-Swap Docking Enclosure in the 5.25" Bay directly beside the disk drive and used a Cable Matters Internal Mini SAS to SATA Cable to plug into the SAS port of the system and fan out to the 4 ports on the hot swap bay. 
 ​
 However, I'm not getting ESXI to see any drives connected in the hotswap bay. while in the bios I'm able to see the one test drive I have connected and I verified the drive is functional in my main computer. Current configuration I have for the bios is that I have SATA/RAID enabled and AHCI set, I have also installed the megarid sas drivers into esxi but still no luck. Has anyone tried this before, is the bios on the T5600 a SAS or SATA type deal where only one port type works?

 Running two 2696V4's on a Shangzhaoyuan C612 chipset mobo...
 https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9FY9YK5?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details
 Everything works great, however, OCCT and HWINFO show both CPU Package powers capped at 23Watts. PSU we're using is a, 1300W EVGA G2.
 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00COIZTZM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 I've messed around with BIOS settings and edited C-States and what not, I got a net gain on benchmarks/Prime95/OCCT/Furmark from 20W capped to now a 30W capped. Throwing WHEA errors on HWINFO/OCCT.
 I have two separate EPS rails per socket power. CPU1, CPU2. EVGA's rails rate "108AMPS/120Watts" per 12V rail, not sure if I'm reading that right... or am I missing something here in BIOS, or on the board itself?
 I've used this power supply to push 300 watt CPU package spikes on a 5950X with PBO curves, I don't think it is the PSU?
 Maybe the board just isn't able to report actual power draw, I'm not sure.
 Fixed WHEA error 19, but no change in actual draw. Running Stress/OCCT/Cinebench/Prime95 over the course of two days everything looks fine otherwise.

 Plug it into the computer, pull up disc management. 
 And promptly formatted the wrong drive. Poof. Around 15tb of movies and tv shows.
 The only backup is a list in meta media manager of the movies. 
 Plex should be able to tell me what tv shows I had.
 I should be able to recover everything, but man some of those shows/seasons were low seeded and took forever.
 The best part? The 16tb red drive won’t initialize. And I bought it from newegg.

 I've tried looking around but all I've found are monthly charges or just not what I'm looking for. 
 My close friends and family game together, record moments, draw art and share/edit them. 
 I would super appreciate any suggestions or advice you guys have. Please keep the topic on what software would be the best for what I'm looking for and not patronizing about security or judgment of character.
 Features I'd really like:
  
Ability to use it through File Explorer like OneDrive.
 Free.
 Fancy bells and whistles like profiles, monitoring, passwords(?), history and ability to Quota the storage into sections, etc.
  
​
 Features that're a must:
  
Users are able to upload, download, delete, edit any files & pictures/text documents and what not as well as stream and play clips FROM my server without having to download them.
  
I am also open to huge one-time payment but I'm not looking for anything with monthly payments.
 The server has windows 11 pro, 128GB of dedotated WAM and 10TB of ssd storage.

I'd like to write down events (and event series, ideally) and have a bit of automation with the todo list, like creating a certain todo list element at the start of the month or stuff like that.
 Is there anything good?

The first time the drive clicked was when I was freshly installing windows 10 on it for the first time with the media creation tool, At first I thought nothing of it as the installation went without a hitch, However after installing a few games and playing them, The drive suddenly clicked in rapid succession which caused a BSOD, Windows 10 was able to boot again but that's where it all went downhill as the clicking never went away till to this day of me writing this, Sometimes it doesn't click for a day or two but I will ultimately reoccur again, As it clicks most of the time when the drive is in heavy use, I have originally thought that It was the hard drive's APM feature acting up that was causing this issue, That's why I followed this Youtube video guide on how to permanently disable the APM feature within the drive(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4UrnP38T0w) But alas, It's all futile, As the clicking of the drive still persists, The drive is still usable and still in perfect health(surprisingly). What on earth could be causing this?

 First: Why?
 Well, a low power node to run the network's essentials is never a bad thing, and I didn't wanted to go for a RaspberryPI, because it's both expensive for what it is at the moment due to shortages, and also because I prefer to reduce the number of different environments I'm running, just for cohesion.
 Though, as a piece of tech from 2017, it sure needed fresh thermal paste. Thankfully, they are quite easy to open and clean. 1 screw under the back sticker, clips all around, 4 screws on the cooler (1 on the back of the board into the cooler, 3 from the front into the chassis), and the fan is just clipped in the removed panel.

 Second: How?
 Well sure, the compute stick only have wifi and bluetooth, and rely on proprietary blobs I can't (or am too lazy to) find, …]]></summary>

It's made by seagate and it's one that needs to be plugged into the wall.

 I read that this kind of USB cases are more prone to errors compared to SATA disk connected diractly to the motherboard. Is it true? If yes, there is some way to avoid it without using ECC RAM?

Either way after ii noticed all my network drives had been disconected, both from my windows laptop, and my android phone, i tried reverting the passowrd just to be sure, but it didn't work

 Example of shared drive
 Windows Defender firewall
 All and all, i'm out of ideas,
 i should mention that if i set those same settings on my laptop, and share one of its folders, my server can easily find it in the network, and mount it with no problem, but not the other way around
 any ideas?
 given that a good chunk of the time i'm messing with files on the server, is working with video files, this is really bothersome
 (last note, that same day all of that happened, i opened the computer management app, but i changed absolutely nothing in there, i only clicked on the Users and profiles tab > Users, after that i changed absolutely nothing in said "users" folder) 
 this will probly turn out to be revelant, so

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’m currently looking for a software solution to host a file download site on a companies Intranet. I noticed that searching for the phrase “Download” on the Internet is a bit tricky ^^
 My requirements are:
  
The Server will have no connection to the Internet
 No Sync option like a cloud is required
 All visitors can download all released files from a web page
 Registered users can upload and manage their files via a web interface
 User can create groups and sub-groups and assign files to this groups
 Files cannot downloaded directly. Instead, the download has to be conducted via a Page for the File on which predefined text fields are shown (e.g., License, Creator, Uploader, Version-No, Contact Data etc.). Also, one or more preview pictures can be displayed.
 The download page allows to download different files (e.g. the same Bitmap in different file formats).
  
I hope for some advice on this, because finding software for this is really a pain in the neck. Thanks, in advanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got myself an early Christmas present and put together a NAS inside a Define R6 case. I threw in a 10Gb NIC (Intel X520) to speed up transfers from my main PC. Airflow isn't bad, but it's not as good as you'd find in a server chassis - especially over the PCIe area.
 https://preview.redd.it/2ra57acm6u7a1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=feab3bcbd1f9e114c8751e146ed1ea717587a8ab
 After being powered on for only a few minutes I noticed the NIC was getting extremely warm with the heatsink being too hot to touch. I took a look with a thermal camera and it was by far the warmest part in the system. The heatsink was too reflective to get an accurate temperature but the back of the board was around 70°C.
 https://preview.redd.it/30h3qgq3eu7a1.jpg?width=512&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=255f5483a9e963f844a931bae48c8316dbe6948b

 I took a look at the X520's datasheet and it requires a minimum air flow of 100LFM. I don't have anything to measure this, but I don't expect I'm even close. I can't see anywhere good to mount a fan nearby, but I might be able to go wild with some zip ties and make something work. I'd be interested to know what people have done to keep their NICs cool in cases they're not designed for. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at hard drives for my first nas build and saw that many people seem to be using Ironwolf Pro drives. Since I plan on using the nas as a media drive only for movies and such, should the basic Ironwolf be enough or should I opt for the Ironwolf Pro? I would like to clarify that I’ll be getting a 2 bay unit only since I’m just starting out and only intend to use it for movies atm. I can always upgrade the unit later but I was wondering if I’ll see a significant difference between the Ironwolf and Ironwolf Pro with the differences in transfer rate, cache, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I've been thinking about setting up my own Raspberry Pi 4 server. I want to use those services: pihole (certainly), duplicati2 (or something similar, certainly), FreeNAS/Nextcloud/Syncthing (one or two of them certainly), OpenVPN/WireGuard (maybe). I wanted to buy Raspberry Pi4 and connect 2 HDDs by USB3 to provide needed storage. I was quite certain Raspberry Pi 4 is a good idea, but the prices of 4 and 8GB editions are very high.
 Now there is those VisionFive2 that has better specs and much lower prices, but uses RISC-V processor. It's going to support Debian. Will the soft I mentioned work on it? Is it a good idea to use VisionFive2 instead of Raspberry Pi4 for such usecases?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I would like....
 I have a relatively large academic text library in PDF, as well as the typical mobi (have kindle), epub, and even .lit (from my old surface pro days) ebook library. I would like a server that has persistent read state and ability to highlight/annotate/export annotations from the file. I would also like multi-user access.
 ​
 What I have tried.....
 Have been running calibre with calibre-web front end, which I don't mind and find the UI ok. The ability to track read status and custom column support in calibre-web is great. It's really only single user however when it comes to read states, etc. Also there is not persistent position in place.
 I have downloaded Kavita and it seems a lot closer to what I want (decide readers, syncs states, multiple user), but the metadata is horrible to non-existent for PDFs. Also when updating the container it wants to try to re-create the database each time for some reason.
 I have also tried audiobookshelf (have moved to this for audiobooks from plex/prologue). The audiobookshelf interface is great. They have ebook support in experimental which puts it beside/embedded with the audiobook, but the readers are horrible. I can just download the epub and send to my kindle or download the pdf (from web, not iOS app unfortunately), and could just upload the pdf back to audiobookshelf when completed.
 ​
 Are there any other options out there that I am missing? I have seen Koodo-reader but seems a bit early. Audiobookshelf or Kavita are developing but still not quite there yet. Calibre-web is closest (but really only single user), but still locked into calibre backend for sorting which I hate.
 Honestly considering just scrapping it and using a folder of sorted files for the time being.

 Subscriptions Filtering
 Subscriptions Filtering is the act of subscribing for events based on the structure of the payload. It is one of our most exciting features. With this, webhook consumers can filter events they receive based on the payload. This includes two types of filters, from simple filters (exact object match) to complex matches (like $or, $in etc.) It would be best if you headed over to our docs to see a complete reference.

 It would be cool to have an app that made it easier to search and go through content. I'd like to be able to tag similar things instead of relying only on using folders. I'm imagining something like Plex where there is a database of information and you can browse or search.
 I've heard of stash but don't have any experience with it.
 Two additional challenges:
  
Most of my content are videos posted online, so these aren't like official released media. There probably isn't an easy database that exists with all the info. I assume I'd have to build that db myself.
 For privacy's sake, I keep all of the data encrypted with VeraCrypt. I am not tied to this solution, but I do want to restrict access, ideally at the file storage layer (but not required). So any solution either has to work directly with some form of encrypted storage, or as part of starting up needs to be able to mount and then access storage otherwise decrypted and made available (maybe something with ZFS?). 
 App ideally also requires authentication to access.

As you can see by the image at the imgur link, they're showing "No Fault" on SMART status. I've seen plenty of weird compatiblity issues, but this one is entirely new to me. Controller is running latest firmware, BIOS has also been upgraded to latest. The drives are firmware 7FA6, and the previous drives I had installed were of the OEM Hitachi Enterprise 2TB SAS variety.

 To add to the weirdness, when I first boot into the controller, they display as "Ready". Only after I try to add them to a VD do they go to "Failed" status.

 I was thinking making a private hosting of Mastodon but I fear that It may be overkill.
 What are your experiences managing it ?
 Is there some cool alternative out the that could be lighter ? :)

When I access the a website it displays the error that the certificate is not valid. I do have the certificate in my trusted root, and my browsers do see it. I can't figure out why its doing this. For fun... I setup a copy of a docker container I am proxying traffic to through to NPM but, instead of using NPM with the copy I modified the local web server and added my self-signed and that works. No more errors. I didn't change the certificate in my trusted certs on my PC to make this work just didn't use NPM.
 I have no idea what I am missing. I've turned on all the radio buttons as needed ET CETRA.. Really kind of lost at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just acquired a 45Drives AV15 server. Currently, I have a Synology ds1813+ with 8x3TB WD Reds. I want the AV15 to replace the ds1813, but I need to get a 16TB to back up the Synology data first. Once I do that, I want to develop the best ZFS design for the av15 based on my current needs. So I’ll have 12x3TB WD Reds and 3x1TB SSD drives that I can use. My current setup is as follows. 
 Synology ds1813 Shares folders Media streaming (jellyfin) Music, airsonic Photos, dsphoto app ISO files and other data stored in the ds1813 VMBackups VMdata (stores some light lxd and vms disk)
 Lenovo m920q. (Proxmox host) VMs and Docker containers are running on it. Backup all proxmox VMs to VMBackups NFS shared
 The plan is to do a hyper-converged on the av15 with proxmox and the Huston gui. I’m new to ZFS and looking for advice on the design of the zpool or pools. 
 Possible considerations Scenario 1 1. zpool with 12 HDD and 3 SSD 1. Two or three VDEV (raidz1,2,3)? 1. Store everything on the zpool
 Scenario 2 1. zpool for the SSD only (raidz1 or mirror) 1. Store VMs on ssd pool 2. Zpool for the HDD (add third SSD for cache)? 1. 2 VDEV raidz1,2? 2. Store media on HDD pool
 Everything will be back up to the 16TB I’ll use to copy the data from the Synology temporarily. 
 Thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated. 
 Thanks Dan

 I have been working for a while in deploying a communitarian network in the rural region of Gandiol, Senegal, and I have been looking for a self-hosted messaging app like Whatsapp or Telegram. The main goal would be to have the following features:
  
Text message exchange among individuals and groups.
 Image/Video exchange.
  Audio/Video call support.
  
A solution I already found, looked promising but does not really end up working well, is to use rocket chat + jitsi. Instead of fighting to make this work properly, does anyone have some knowledge of any application that covers the features I mentioned before? Ideally would be an application that only do that, would like to avoid something more complex like Mattermost.
 Thanks everyone in advance and any idea is welcome :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently building a small NAS/Server to store my files and in the future host some docker containers (Tandoor, Bitwarden, Jellyfin, maybe the *arr-suite, etc.). I am using an asrock h370m itx that I plann to pair with an i3 9100 in a Jonsbo N1 with 5 HDDs for storage and 1 Sata SSD as a boot drive. In the future I could also add an nvme as a cache.
 As I understand, TrueNAS Core does not support docker as it is based on FreeBSD. TrueNAS Scale, however, does. So now I am torn between using Proxmox to setup a TrueNAS VM for my NAS use and a Linux VM for my docker/home server use.
 What option makes more sense? This is my first time building a home server that isn't just running Linux so I'm a little lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in the old part of town with frequent power outages. Unmonitored situation with 8 computers. Get about 2 years out of the original batteries but the SLA quickly lose capacity since they are totally discharged every time the power goes out. Then when we are at work the UPS are only useful for power blips and brownouts. The the power goes out we only get 5-10 min actual run time. I expect this situation will improve with the LiFeP04 and the overall cost will be much lower. Even deep cycle SLA do not tolerate frequent full discharges so that technology is not useful to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Spun up a Mediawiki install on a Debian server today, and I'm absolutely stumped trying to get this to work behind a reverse proxy. If I go to the IP of the server/wiki, it works fine, but if I go to the subdomain that I configured for this - pointed at my nginx proxy manager docker container that is handling SSL for me - it loads the default apache page instead.
 I tried specifying a custom location in the proxy host of "/" with the forward being 192.168.1.54/wiki/, and that just gives me the Apache 404 page.
 I've changed the $wgServer parameter in LocalSettings.php to be wiki.mydomain.com.
 I'm not sure if I should be looking at the apache configuration on my server, or additional parameters in nginx...
 I also tried editing the default config file in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/ to point to /var/www/html/wikias that's where the PHP files are located for Mediawiki, and restarted apache. No luck.
 Does anyone have a similar setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 There have been many posts here on this topic, but after reviewing most of them I emerge perplexed. What I like about Pastebin is the ability to login and see your past pastes. I also like the ability to modify or even delete posts. Obviously, it is multi-user, but that is not needed in the homelab.
 The options that I have considered are LenPaste and Privatebin, but both seem to have a concept of creating a paste that has no editability or even in some cases visibility after creation. (For example, neither seem to allow edit or deletion of pastes after creation.) I think that the they do this to ensure privacy and security, but I prefer something more Pastebin like even if it requires a security trade off.
 I am confused about why these seemingly basic features are nowhere to be found in OSS pastebin alternatives. Am I missing something? Are there other options that I should be considering that have these features?
 TIA!

Since I want to avoid Molex-to-SATA adapters, is it possible to connect a 6-pin to 4x SATA (EVGA) to the 6-pin PERIF connector (PSU side)? Looking around, I found that the only difference is the absence of the 3.3v pin. Am I right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using this rsync command on my new debian/openmediavault server in order to get all data moved from the old one onto this one:
 rsync -hazP --stats -e "ssh -T -c aes256-gcm@openssh.com -o Compression=no -x" root@10.10.10.15:/srv/27829c9c-dbc1-4408-a111-56dbcd8f0ec0/media/ /srv/mergerfs/norman_pool2/media
 In both instances, the data is in a unionfs or mergerfs pool. 10.10.10.15 is the IP of the NIC on the source server which should make it communicate over 10Gb only since that port is plugged into the 10Gb NIC on the new server with a DAC cable. The only other interfaces are the main 1GB NICs which each have a line going to my router/switch
 The new server is intel I3 12100 with 32GB ram, the old is Dell R710 with dual xeon L5664 CPUs and 32 GB ram. They both show low CPU utilization and ram utilization during the process, but I'm not seeing more than 15MB/s on larger files, 5-10MB on smaller ones. I think the highest I've seen is 18MB/s which seems insanely slow for a direct 10Gb connection
 Is there anything I'm not thinking of, or anything the command could use to speed things up even more

 So far it seems like the only 4u case that does not break the bank a lot is the RSV-L4000U from Rosewill . Is it a good choice? Are there any other recommendations? 
 Also seems like the prices are currently elevated (supply chain issues still?) Any guidance on if waiting a bit longer would bring sanity to the prices? I've read that the Rosewill RSV-L4000U used to be around $130 not too long ago.

 I'm guessing this may be related to the fact I'm using "Nginx Proxy Manager" to make it so I can use this alongside my smarthome system I'm self hosting. Home Assistant. I'm not super confident I've set up that correctly. I followed a different tutorial to get that set up and I'm guessing there's just a minor configuration difference. 
 During the mastodon tutorial I did skip the SSL Certbot step, since the Nginx proxy manager was already handling the SSL part, and I'm guessing this is where I screwed up. 
 Here's the configuration options I tried in the Nginx proxy manager and what happened each time.
 What I did first, what I thought was correct based on the Nginx Proxy Manager I followed previously:
 ​
 When I did this, I'd get \"TOO MANY REDIRECTS\" error in the browser.
 As a test, I tried to set the scheme for https, with the forward port 443, I got this instead. Notice the mastodon favicon, that did not happen last time.
 And just for completion sake, here is the nginx configuration file on the server that's running mastodon: https://pastebin.com/aJZLKnhE

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I just bought a 1u server off eBay with the motherboard in title.
 It came with with everything it should need to run. The seller listed it saying it posted and that’s as far as they tested.
 When I power it on, the fans spin up for a few seconds, then it shuts off.
 I have connected the ipmi lan Port and was able to get on the ipmi web page, but the default credentials don’t work.
 When I connect my monitor, it switches on to react to the new connection, but doesn’t display anything when the server powers on.
 I have tried my gaming pc power supply connected to the main board but it does the same thing. My pc psu only has 1 8pin cpu connector and this motherboard needs 2 8 pins. 
 I tried taking the memory out to try get a beep code, but it acted exactly the same.
 There is definitely a cpu in the socket.
 Visually the motherboard looks ok. No burst caps or anything.
 Am I looking at a dead server or am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I own a Terramaster f2-221. I'm the guy asking about single disk nas a few days ago.
 Yesterday night, while the nas was turned off, my electricity went away for a few minutes.
 Since this morning, my NAS doesn't work anymore. 
 Using tnas the NAS results as Uninitialized, if i try to connect to it's IP via browser it shows me the setup wizard, makes me create a new account and delete all previous data. If i try to connect via file manager, internet explorer, winscp or whatever it always open the setup Wizard or it asays connection refused 
 Connecting the add on pc shows several partitions, all healty, but there is no way for my pc to show the contents on the hdd, it only appears in the partition tool of windows 
 I try connecting via SSH with Putty (https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=75&t=2350), and it worked...but it said it created a new folder for my admin user (that already existed). The NAS does remember the name i've given to it tho, so i'm confused if the data is there or got partially deleted.
 Anyway, i followed this guide (https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=79&t=2575&p=13904#p13904) but, the results were completely different: no red or any colored text, only white text that more or less looks fine from my very limited knowledge, i coulnd't spot any error message 
 I literally don't know what to do apart from wiping my drive, i want to recover the data since there are still important things that i still have to back up elsewhere, and also over a terabyte of hard to find content. 
 Can anyone help me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody! 
 I have been working as a software developer for almost 10 years, and, for work stuff we always almost use cloud services.
 I love server less approaches etc, when it comes to handing a client an solution.
 But sometimes I do projects of my own, and in those cases I feel that the work becomes too much..
 Imagine just having the ability to run a Redis that allows my services to communicate, and then expose an Web App to show some data.
 So, here I am, I want to fix a home setup! 
 The main goal is running small pieces of software that I build at home, and then often expose an Web App using Node to communicate with my Services.
 Where should I start? 
 I have been looking at Synology and Qnap NAS as options, very cheap and seems really easy to get started with.
 Any recommendations and or guides to follow for this? 
 Basically my goals are
  
Run Services through Docker (Only Locally)
 Expose WebApps running Node to reach the local services
 Attach Domain Names, I guess something needs to be done for DNS, or would a simple Redirect from my DomainProvider to my IP be enough? 
  
Marry Christmas and Happy new Year

 I have created my own self hosted app (docker/python) to fill a gap in the market! A niche gap but a gap!
 Github Link : https://github.com/benkey0/ChristmasPresentChecker
 I love to make repeitive tasks slighlty easier like most of us do! Christmas presents involve lots of writing tags and lets face it tags arent fun!
 I have created a application to decode barcodes (using hardware scanner or device camera) and provide a front end solution for Christmas morning.
 You simply add sticky barcodes (printed with a thermal printer or ordered online for cheap!) onto your presents and add them into the Christmas Present Checker using the front end interface.
 Please see the below video.

 Essentialy this is my first time making something "semi-useful". I would appreciate some feedback and although its not as useful as most things shared here it may be something festive to play around with over this period!
 Merry Christmas!
 Ben

 I ended up automating part of my setup with Ansible.
 Host your stuff provides (among other things):
  
Nextcloud instance (snap)
 
Vaultwarden instance (docker)
 
SearxNG instance (docker)
 
fail2ban
 
Bunkerweb
 
Regular updates and backups for these services
 
Certs using certbot
 
 This is born from my personal use case so it's pretty much a WIP and might have some rough edges here and there.
 However I though I'd share it around in case its of use for someone else.
 There are probably 100 better ways of doing this, any feedback is welcome.

I have been trying to manage a growing number of local files, notes (notion).
 All of this has led me on a search for what I am calling an integrated storage solution, or a tool that will keep all of my files, bookmarks, and things of that nature organized. I would like to have a single file tree to manage files bookmarks notes and media. I currently use notion for my notes, and I am working on finding a way to integrate that.
 Next cloud has most of the functionality I believe I will need, and I may set up a server for it soon, but I want to see if there are any better options. I am ok with non self-hosted apps and self-hosted apps, and would prefer the software to not be a subscription (free option or one time purchase)
 Thanks for the suggestions and comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we all know that reddit lists are limited to 1000 posts at a time, but push shift archives everything so theoretically you should be able to use that website to get all post submissions from a subreddit.
 Now the real question is, how would you be able to archive an entire subreddit(including the media posted). I have seen things like telegram bots but they will only archive stuff from the date they are added, not useful at all for getting stuff that's already been posted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I reached out to Synology about this but the tech wasn’t sure how to answer it.
 I use a Synology single-bay NAS and the Cloud Sync application to mirror all of my data (one root folder with all data inside) to both Backblaze B2 and Google Drive. The syncing is up to date, so Backblaze and Google Drive have copies of every piece of data I own, and further, so does a WD 16TB external drive. The really important stuff is further backed up on my PC, laptop, bluray discs, other external drives (one being at a friend’s house), Microsoft OneDrive, and Mega.io, so I’m not concerned about data loss.
 I am wondering, though, if my Synology hard drive fails permanently, is anyone here able to outline the least time consuming workflow it would take to setup a brand new Synology NAS (or new drive in the original Synology tower) to sync up with both Backblaze B2 and Google Drive the way the original Synology drive did, so that anything I add to the root folder will continue being seamlessly backed up to both cloud services as before? Since I have the a WD external drive with the entirety of my data (same exact data as on Backblaze B2 and Google Drive), could I transfer that root folder with all of my data from the WD external to the new Synology NAS, and then can Cloud Sync compare the contents between that folder, Backblaze and Google drive and consider them to be synced up without the need for mass upload / download again?
 Thank you for your time. Please let me know if I may clarify anything I’ve outlined above.

 I''m spending more time than I want in some countries I don't want to name (somewhere in Asia), where the internet is sometimes problematic to use. I'll just say that they tried to use fake ssl certs on gov level before, and from my experience they are still trying to get access to peoples data.
 There are times when Wireguard works fine, then stop connecting at all. PPTP and L2TP are the most reliable (in term of creating a tunnel) but sometimes they also won't work. OVPN the same.
 Tried tailscale and netmaker, results vary.
 What do you recommend to set up on my home server (in EU) to reliably access?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our energy bills skyrocket (even more if you're unfortunate to live in a middle of Europe), and most of us start thinking twice before adding shiny new refurbished server into our racks. I wonder how do you folks optimise energy usage for your homelab? 
 The path I went through recently began from re-thinking the purpose of all my boxes:
  
which ones need to run constantly 24h/day?
 which ones should run during a day, when most of my (and my family's) activity happens?
 which ones should run occasionally, when one needs to access concrete services?
  
Surprisingly, the answer for 1. was "none" - I don't need to keep anything running during a night and this way I also discovered I may "sleep" and "wake-up" on predefined schedule all of my servers, including Synology NAS. Proxmox behaves a bit weird (for example I can't log-in to certain nodes after wake up for some reason), but I can live with it.
 The answer for 2nd question was more tricky. Definitely NAS with couple of crucial docker containers (like paperless, dashboard) and AzuraCast are something that everyone at home uses a lot and it should run at least till 22:00. This is where I discovered that all these services are lightweight enough to locate them on single raspberry pi. 
 The answer for 3rd question was the easiest - everything else should run "on-demand". In particular things related to software dev (Gitea, Drone CI, Coolify, etc.) should start when needed. I managed to reduce required hardware to 2 boxes only - Intel NUC for Kubernetes cluster and Lenovo m720q for the rest, and move them straight onto my desk. They are extremely quiet so no feeling of sitting next to the jumbo-jet.
 I'm still curious how much does it save (maybe not worth the effort), still measuring energy usage. Along the way, I also had to re-evaluate my plans to buy Dell r720. Would be great to have those 48 threads for my hungry clojure containers, but I guess I would have to find another job to pay crazy bills :)

 I was looking for something that could hold some hard drives but I wanted to explore doing a all flash based vdev, managed to shove all of it inside this ITX case with barely any room to spare. SSDs are in raidz1, 8TBs are mirrored archival, 16TBs are in raidz1 for a redundant copy of data and things I don't care too much about. 3-2-1.
 This thing gets toasty though, the case is nice but isn't built well for airflow. I get way better performance leaving the outer shell off. It draws more power than I intended, might explore the Atom based platforms next.
 Max capacity of this this thing could be insane with ~100TB of HDD capacity, 48TB of 2.5" SSD capacity, and another 40TB of NVM…]]></summary>

 Years ago, I had a program that would show you each image, and you would select a number from 1-9, which mapped to a folder, and it was easy to speed through and quickly sort large amounts of photos. 
 Has anyone heard of software like this? I can't for the life of me remember what it was called.

 128 GB of DDR4 RAM
 DUAL (2) CPU Slots
 1 CPU with 3.5+ GHZ and 10+ Cores with multi threading
 NO GPU (its not needed, its just hosting)
 200-400 GB of storage 
 ​
 My budget is around 300-400, I've looked and found multiple parts just I can't find any that together. 
 Thanks, Nicc

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently hosting all my services on my Synology NAS. I've used the built in Synology reverse proxy (which uses nginx under the hood I believe) but was beginning the transition to traefik as I needed some more customizability as I was onboarding Authentik.
 I realized that one of the main advantages of Traefik is it's docker integration. Most of my services are running via docker on my NAS. I use portainer to manage my containers.
 I've got some additional machines on order which I'm intending to move several of my services to in order to lighten the load on my NAS and increase performance.
 With the use of multiple machines, Traefik docker integration may have less of an advantage. I still intend to user docker, just will be on multiple machines. Some x86 and some ARM. Should I continue with my Traefik migration or should I switch into setting up NPM or a different alternative instead?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggests, I'm looking for an Apple WatchOS app which supports offline playback for a self-hosted music streaming service. Unfortunately Plex (PlexAmp) has no interest in this despite many users requesting it.
 Other than Plex/PlexAmp, I currently have Navidrome as my streamer and substreamer client apps on Android/iOS devices. This works great for offline caching & online streaming. The only thing missing for me and family is offline playback on WatchOS for use without phone. (Think going for a run, working out in the gym etc).
 The only subsonic API compatible app that I have come across which has Apple WatchOS support for offline playback is AVSub - unfortunately the app is quite buggy and music playback on the Watch actually stops as soon as the watch screen turns off, so basically useless.
 Is there anything else out there or do I just need to pay the man and get a Tidal subscription?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I run multiple services on a VPS, as well as a VPN.
 All of the services are exposed to the Internet and can be publically reached. Now, I would like to have certain services behind a VPN, so they are not exposed.
 How to do this?
 What do I have to do in my docker config, so that it works? And what link would I have to use to access it? Given that I am connected with my VPN, would I be able to use localhost:port?
 ​
 I am using for example the glances service. I used the following docker compose:
 version: '3' services: glances: image: nicolargo/glances:latest-full container_name: glances ports: - "61208:61208" - "61209:61209" volumes: - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro restart: always environment: - "GLANCES_OPT=-w -u user" pid: host 
 For me it is clear that I should not expose any ports. But I also dont know what else to do :)
 So all help is welcome!

 The machine currently has a 256Gb SSD and I have 2x 3Tb drives on the way. I’d like to use the Tb drives to be all of the storage for the VMs with some redundancy. 
 Can I virtualize a TrueNAS or Unraid setup on part of the drives and leave part for storage on any other machines? Part of the use case would be virtualized Plex, pointing to files on the NAS. Is this a bad idea? What are my other options without spending money on additional hardware?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yeah, the time finally came. My "gaming PC" that was converted to a home server isn't enough anymore. I just mounted a hard drive in a cooler slot, and feel terrible about it.
 It's about time that I get a proper server rack and the components inside it.
 My use:
  
Storage. I'm now at the 10TB mark, but that's not nearly enough. Not to mention, I do not have backups for everything, just for the really important stuff.
 Jellyfin. Lots of bluray 2160p videos, the server should be capable of streaming at least 3 at a time.
 2x Minecraft Servers with mods. I noticed this isn't really heavy on my server (besides RAM usage), so I need to have some RAM available for that.
  
When built, I also want to selfhost Nextcloud, Vaultwarden and archive odd videogame ROMs, besides all of the previously mentioned.
 I cannot have a big server rack. It simply doesn't fit in my home. Maybe in the future, but for now I want something on the smaller side. I'm also not with a lot of money, so if possible, something cheap will be great :P (Used server equipment?)
 So, I need help. What do I need to buy? What do I need to understand? I'm not from the US

 I am working on the RAM spec of a Dell PowerEdge R730 with dual Xeon E5-2620 v4
 ​
 The Xeon E5-2620 v4 CPU details listed here:
 https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/sku/92986/intel-xeon-processor-e52620-v4-20m-cache-2-10-ghz/specifications.html

 Here is the CPUs memory specification:

 According to the specification, Max number of Memory Channels is 4
 Considering that I have two of the CPU, is it safe to assume that the server perform better with 2x4 = 8 modules?
 If the answer is no, how do I find the optimal number of DDR DIMMs for the server?

 The idea would be to centralize my email connections into the hosted webmail instance, and then stream the mails into my laptops and phones. Something like having a roundcube instance, with all my emails (that I can connect to on the browser), and then a desktop app (like thunderbird) that would get all that data.
 I tried cypht and roundcube, but I didn't find any way to.
 Any idea on a specific setup that could work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been struggling for the longest time with 50mbps ISP service where I’m located. I just received a door hanger yesterday from Frontier that they’re expanding fiber to my address and it looks like I’ll be signing up for their 2gig service.
 With that in mind, all of my existing networking is setup at a pretty basic level since I’ve only been working with a 50mbps service. My setup comes from my ISP source and goes into a Linksys Velop WHW03 and then into a basic 1g switch that then goes to the rest of my network. Everything is utilizing Cat5 or Cat5e. I also have an UnRaid server running on a Dell R720 that I’d like to optimize for my network traffic since I run a Plex server, Nextcloud and other services on it.
 Frontier is running a promo where they provide a free Eero 6 mesh system during setup, so I should be ok from a router/AP standpoint.
 I’m mostly wanting to know what the most optimal, budget friendly setup would be from a cabling standpoint, and what network switch I should go with. I’m wanting to do it as cheaply as possible while still making use of the upgraded ISP speeds.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a video editor and I frequently work with huge files (8K RedRaw or Phantom CineRaw etc). I’m looking for a fast storage solution that I can edit off of. I was looking at the OWC Express 4M2 which allows large capacity storage running at 2.8GBs with four drives running RAID 0. (https://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/TB3EX4M2/ )
 I was digging into its specs and it says it requires four drives in RAID 0 because the drives inside are limited to 700MBs due to being a 1-lane PCIe connection. 
 There are single drive thunderbolt 3/4 enclosures out there which offer similar speeds but I’m looking for large capacity along with speed. 
 Before I pull the trigger, I was wondering if there was anything else out there that could be faster that would better fit my needs?
 (Yes I realize in my hunt for speed this is probably overkill, but I’d like to do my due diligence).

I have a Synology DS920 with a handful of Docker containers on, and I have Proxmox running on a 1L USFF PC that I can put a VM, container, etc. on as needed. Both are on the same gigabit LAN. 
 The backend storage would probably end up being on the NAS either way, given the relative storage available between the two.
 Would I be better off setting up NC in Docker on the Synology, or in a VM or LXC container on the proxmox host, and why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Maybe I should start with that I'm almost a complete noob at this and I'm learning it on the go so I would be grateful if you can spare me your sarcastic comments and mockery. Thanks//
 So, I have some thoughts about turning my old PC into a server. What would I need for running it smoothly? It has a 1TB SSD, i5 3.2 processor, and 16 Gb RAM. I have 2 external HDDs so I can place my data there - music, movies, etc. I can run Docker for the servers. I'm thinking about one music server - maybe Airsonic-Advanced - to remotely access my library, one movies server - maybe Jellyfin, because I can install it on my android TV, and some proxy or VPN - maybe Tailscale, because it's easy for me to set it up.
 Right now, I've installed WSL and Docker on Windows 11 (my current PC) to run my servers, but my old PC is collecting dust and laying in the closet so I'm thinking about making it like a personal server and moving my containers there. The thing is that those VM are much RAM consuming (maybe like 40%) and I have 32 Gb. Right now I'm running Tailscale on PC so the connection with the server wouldn't be much of a problem - local and remote. I've worked all my life on Windows, but I'm eager to learn new things and I think that Linux is more appropriate for those types of stuff(or at least what I'm reading from people guides and comments).
 So my question is should I continue to work on Windows - install it on my old PC and run my Docker containers on WSL again or should I install Linux and try learning it on the go? Also, what about FreeNas or OpenMediaVault? Are those systems better for the things which I want to run and would be hard for me to configure them and access them from my PC?
 Please, tell me your thoughts about this, because I'm in a dilemma about which path I should go to. Thanks in advance!

 We help our customers send webhooks by offering them a full webhook sending solution. We have a hosted version which is based on the Svix open source project.
 The open source project can be self-hosted (and many people do!), so I thought I'd share it here.
 I'd also love to take this opportunity to ask for feedback. What can we do to make it even easier to self-host Svix? You can check out the instructions on the README. I think things are fairly simple, but we would always like to improve.
 Here's the repo if you want to check it out: https://github.com/svix/svix-webhooks

 I recently switched from windows 10 to windows 11 which has made filehistory an even bigger mess to use so I want to look for an alternative that works better. 
 What I want to accomplish:
 Incremental back-ups (don't want it to create a full back-up everytime)
 Have it automatically back-up to my NAS
 Able to select which folders to back-up
 A nice to have would also be a filehistory way where I can go back to a version X days ago.
 Anyone have a recommendation for software able to accomplish this (preferably something lightweight)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi self-hosters,
 I've been silently following this subreddit for a really long time. First of all, thanks a ton to everyone out here. You guys have inspired me and motivated me to self-host.
 Cutting things short, my current set up looks like:
 An old Sony VAIO Laptop (i3 330m, 2+4GB RAM, 1TB 5400RPM HDD) as a Proxmox server with the following Ubuntu 22.04 LTS CT(s):
  
AdGuard Home : Primary DNS Resolver
 Radarr + Prowlarr + qBitTorrent + JellyFin : Media Server
 SnapDrop : Useful LAN File Share Utility
 ArchiveBox : Useful Web Archiving Utility
  
A Raspberry Pi 3B+ with Raspberry Pi OS Lite as a Backup AdGuard Home DNS Resolver (synced from Primary)
 These two together are currently serving my purposes really well, while not adding up electricity bills significantly.
 I used to host Vaultwarden and FreshRSS as well. For Vaultwarden, I do not benefit from the client-server synced up model as although I tried convincing my family, none of them uses a Password Manager. Provided it's just me and I don't really need my passwords on phone a lot, I prefer KeePassXC on my one and only Linux laptop. Same reason for FreshRSS. I used to use it with the self hosted instance of http://ftr.fivefilters.org to get Full Text RSS feeds but, I ended up feeling better with QuiteRSS. I read feeds on a single machine and full text feed isn't really a must-to-have. 
 My family is really happy with Adblocking DNS, Archiving and LAN File Share utilities and mainly because of the Jellyfin media server. 
 I'm really looking forward to add more useful tools/utilities. Please recommend some services that you self host yourself and are very useful/utilitarian in nature for you and your family. 
 (No dashboard. No Reverse Proxy like Caddy. Already considered but I'm fine without them. I've also considered the Awesome Self-Host and Sysadmin Github repositories.)
 Thanks in advance. Peace!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey community!
 For years I was only a user of open source projects, now I want to give a little bit back.
 I have created movary, a self-hosted web application to track and rate watched movies, similar to services like trakt.tv or letterboxd.com. After years of tracking my watch history with commercial services I was getting afraid what would happen if one of these services would stop providing their website or if they "lose" their databases. What about my watch history and ratings? I wanted access to this data in an easy and reliable way, so I started working on this project. It stores all used (meta)data locally, provides third party api integrations with e.g. plex and a few things more (check the README of the project).
 I think I want to release the first stable version soon and would be happy over any feedback.

 bought 2x 4tb seagate ironwolf and now after finding time to build my proxmox homelab with a truenas VM on it I noticed that one of the drives is making interesting noises. I would consider the type of noise "normal" for a hard drive but not this frequent. s.m.a.r.t test says everything is fine though. 
 They have still warranty but because I'm not an expert I wanted to ask you guys what to do maybe someone here had the same issue and there is a easier way than contacting seagate and sending the drive to them. Or maybe im just paranoid but I don't think that this is normal. 
 Many thanks in advance :)

 When I was first getting started in automation and VMs I put a few things together in different raid configurations to try and test performance..

 I have synology nas server, firefox browser in docker and openvpn-client in docker as well. Firefox works via openvpn-client.
 But now i need different instances of firefox per user; the openvpn-client container better to be the global single instance for all firefoxes, but it doesn't have to be. Also i can switch to another browser if necessary, this is not a problem.
 So, when the user connects, a new browser container should be created and then deleted when the user's session is over.
 What is the best way to do it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After reading the post from yesterday about Kasm Workspaces, I've decided to try it.
 I have issues with RDP connections, none of them is working.
 Tried three different Windows machines (Win 10 variants), one local on the same VM host, one connected via LTE, 20-30 ms away (wireguard), and the third about 180 ms away (L2TP) from the KASM server.
 All of them are sitting on the loading screen, "Creating a secure connection..."
 At the same time if I fire up the Remmina workspace I can connect to all three without issues.
 Any hint what I'm doing wrong?
 Edit: I am running Kasm behind Nginx Proxy Manager, the Zone settings a set according to the manual.
 Edit 2: Made a short test. Connected with Remmina to the local Windows VM, then started the Workspace linked to the same machine.
 The expected result is to kick away Remmina client and accept the new one. After starting the Kasm client Remmina is still connected and stays like that.

So I’m thinking of getting a 10g RJ-45 PCIE NIC for each server and connecting the two via CAT6. Then configuring each NIC with an IP on a different subnet than my current LAN. If my understanding is correct, this should work right? Wanted to upgrade my entire LAN to 10g but prices of switches and other needed hardware are kinda high right now. Also only really need 10g between the two servers. I can make it happen for around $30-$50 buying used NICs on eBay. Already have the CAT6 cabling.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, r/homelab,
 My ISP now offers 1.5+ gbps (3 gbps is already available, with 8 gbps coming early 2023). So that means upgrade time for my network.
 I have been looking for a 10 gbps switch/router, with a preference for a managed, L3 switch. 8+ ports (either copper of fiber as converters exists anyway). Interconnect is 2 X NAS systems, main desktop, 2-3 servers running Kubernetes (might be on a separate l2 switch as a bit far. None currently have 10 gbps adapters so will need to be purchased. All on copper at this time. Also I have APs and a few other devices that will remain on 1gbps. I already have a m,icrotik router that I can reuse (1gbps, 10 ports).
 I am in a fairly small space so noise is an important factor. Here is what im looking at for now:
 L3:
 New - Microtik CRS309-1G-8S+IN:
 Looks decent, 8 x sfp+ ports. I have experience with Microtik and am used top their OS, however specs are low, especially on L3. It is cheap and should be silent. about 280$USD
 Used - Arista DCS 7X series, 1U. 24X+ SFP+, good manageability, no experience with Arista but thats fine (I have dealt with Juniper and Cisco in the past). Worried about noise... About 400$USD on ebay.
 New - NETGEAR 10-Port Multi-Gigabit/10G Ethernet Smart Managed Pro Switch (MS510TXM) :
 Looks ok but I have heard of issues with Netgear stuff. Mostly copper so less work as installing fiber is more complex, however 2.5 gbps/10gbps copper is more expensive. Also 2x more expensive the others at about 600$USD. Might be worth the cost if silent and ok l3 features.
 I have also looked at Cisco and Jiuniper, but noise levels and cost are really high on those, so im really not sure it makes sense.
 L2:
 Ubiquiti Networks UniFi 8-Port 10G SFP+, looks ok, cost-effective, but out of stock everywhere.
 Anyone has go to models for this? Its a lot more complex then I taught it would be, so many options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm planning on doing a major rebuild of my homelab, hopefully starting it this weekend, and completing by next. I've been going back and forth on whether I should keep a second NAS running for an additional backup location or not.
 The main NAS will be a TrueNAS and main pool will be a 5 disc raid z2 configuration. Raid is not a backup, I know this. I typically keep very important data also saved, less frequently, to an external HDD that spends most of its life unplugged.
 Finally I'm planning to hopefully get an offsite TrueNAS setup in either my office (different state) or mother's home (also different state) that I can remotely backup to.
 I have everything to setup a second unRaid at home. My thought is it's a second backup location, and using unRaid means I can just dump drives as needed into it to grow the pool with little thought to the structure compared to TrueNAS?
 Thoughts from you other homelabbers?

 I can sort of do this with just nginx (without nginx proxy manager) using the conf file which looks similar to this ->
 ​
 upstream picoshare { server picoshare:4001; } server { server_name mydomain.com; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate ./fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key ./privkey.pem; ssl_dhparam ./dhparam.pem; include ./options-ssl-nginx.conf; location /text-matcher { include uwsgi_params; uwsgi_pass text_matcher:8080; } location /picoshare { proxy_pass https://picoshare; } } 
 However I want to use nginx proxy manager to achieve this. I also need to redirect all HTTP calls to HTTPS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently learned how to use Cloudflare Tunnels to expose services hosted at my home lab (the recent NetworkChuck Video). I got a new domain, linked a couple of my homelab services (jellyfin, tinytiny rss feed aggregator) to it and it worked great (having 500/500mbps fiber connection).
 2 days later google flagged the main domain and all subdomains as dangerous (Phishing and malware).
 I connected my domain with Google Search Console/Webmaster tools, and it shows that the tinytiny-rss feed aggregator subdomain as the main culprit for the dangerous site.
 I removed the suspected hostname/subdomain from the tunnel 24 hours ago, and still my main site url is still flagged, and even many AV software and firewalls are continuously flagging my domain as malware. I was able yesterday to open my service in Chrome by click continue to the site, but now my AV and firewall refuses the connection.
 I requested google to re-check the domain, but it seems this is not going to work.
 Any tips? Why did even Google flag it? I never published the domain to anybody, it is just for personal use and personal services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm looking for a secure way to host different web browsers through a portal such as Windows Remote Desktop Services or other similar alternatives. I know Remote Desktop Services wouldn't be the best way to achieve this, so I'm hoping there exists a solution specifically made for this purpose.
 I'm looking to set up something similar to Browserling.com but running locally in my network. I want a secure way to open links that may be malicious without fears of infecting my system, or just a way to test different web services with a clean browser each time.
 Are there any self hosted alternatives out there that i can set up on my VMware esxi machine? What setup would be the most secure for this?
 Any leads would be much appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My use case here is a 12 3.5in bay offsite backup. Grunt isn't really required outside of just being able to manage the disks, it's largely about the bays and if i can get unraid running on it. Hotswap is also something i would prefer due to how i store drives during transport. Not looking for anything rack mounted as that's just too much for this purpose.
 So i have two possibilities: 
  
I can try to find a 12 bay case of the small to medium size variety and work around that(maybe with 5.25" hot swap expanders?)
 I can find a consumer NAS that can have it's OS changed(i.e a terramaster, QNAP, etc) and use one of those if i can find one that isn't egregiously expensive, as they tend to have smaller form factors than most DIY cases.
  
Anybody have any ideas on suggestions for either the former or the latter? 12 seems to be a pretty odd non-rack form factor so there's not a whole lot out there i could find. Stuff like the QNAP TS-1655 might work but i couldn't find any to even get a price. The Terramaster T12-423 looked promising but i was wondering if i could find anything cheaper. Old consumer NAS units might be the way to go but i'm not familiar enough with the model numbers of said units to know what to search for. Most case searches yielded not a whole lot.

The serial numbers shown in the photos return no warranty, but they show up as WD products with the following model number: 0F31156 and description: LEE Drive ASM 14.0TB, 512e, SATA P3_PWDIS_Support, Amazon, Secure Erase.
 Would these be safe to buy? What can I do to check they truly are the capacity they claim they are?
 I would like to do a full check with H2testw, but I've been told it takes a while. What would you do?
 Thanks in advance.
 Edit: they also show crystal disk info screenshots
 Edit 2: there seem to be 2 sellers, one that is a clearance warehouse, and the other that has a physical retail location and offers a 6 month warranty, so I'll add updates as I go

 I want to upgrade my network due to inconsistent performance (poor reception / unexpected drop outs of non-moving devices), and a desire to roam around my house without the network dropping while working from home. I'd appreciate any thoughts you all have on my plan.
 Constraints
 My brick house is a 2800 sq. ft. split-level with five half-levels that need coverage and a 1/4 acre backyard that needs coverage. Walls are a combination of plaster and drywall.
 Current Setup
 I'm current running a TP-Link Archer C9 router/AP (flashed with DD-WRT) from the top floor on one side of the house and a TP-Link powerline Wi-Fi AP to the third floor on the other side of the house. In general, it works pretty well when near the APs -- within 20 ft sphere of it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Currently I'm using an HPE V1920-48G (JG927A) for my homelab and recently I was given a Netgear GS752TPP for free from work. I dug into the spec sheets for both and from what I can find they seem pretty comparable to each other (except for the Netgear having POE). 
 I was wondering if anyone has had experience with one versus the other or knew of any features that one might have over the other. In general though, I'm just curious about people's opinions for whether I should "switch" (no pun intended) out what I have for what I received. As of right now, the only positive I can find for doing so is having POE. 
 Thanks!

 also, i don't have 2 equal hard drives, so i'd get the worse writting and the worse reading speeds from both 
 either way, i wanna sync a folder every night, so that every change i made to a folder on one drive during the day, gets copied over to the other drive during the night at a specified hour
 New files, Edited files, different files with the same file name, deleted files, all completely mirrored from the drive i used during the day, but only perform the changes at night, or maybe every other day even
 ​
 what program could i use to do that?

 I personally love it, it looks cool, clean, neat and helps me track which company is spamming me. And if I don't want anymore communication from certain company I could just turn that alias off in Simple Login.
 It's the setup for my other general purpose domain which doesn't contain my name, don't know how companies considering my job application will like it.
 If this is a bad idea, how about ["contact25@firstlast.com](mailto:"contact1@firstlast.com)"? So instead of company name, I'm assigning a unique number to each company.

 I have seen several VoIP apps use self signed certificate thumbprints as a form of verification during key exchange. 
 Two certificates cannot have the same thumbprint. However, can a certificate be engineered/coded to have the same thumbprint as the original certificate? 
 If this is not, how is it not possible? 
 Additionally, what is a digital signature? 
 Thank you.

 Better ones like 123, 101, 24, 365 etc were taken so these two are the best I can come up with. Also available are 000, 222, 444, 555, 888.
 If I were to give my email to you, which one do you think looks better and is easier for you to rememer? Like it sticks and less likely to be confused with something else etc. Just like I'm not going for 3650 because people might forget the 0 at the end.

I have wanted to move away from JumpCloud and properly set up Active Directory on Windows Server 2022. I already moved all my VM's to a second hard drive (and physically unplugged it), so nothing important is on my C drive. I also made a windows server USB flash drive with Rufus, but I am not sure what the best way to install it is. My server is in my basement and does not have a monitor, keyboard, or mouse plugged into it. I have always used MeshCentral/Team Viewer to access it. 
 Is there a way to remotely install Windows Server, such as through TeamViewer? Obviously, TeamViewer wouldn't work because the os is being installed, but there has to be an easier way than to sit there with a monitor and keyboard. Does anyone know of any software that would allow me to remotely install an OS, or even a way to install TeamViewer/MeshCentral after install automatically? I use NTLite to install Windows 10 with PowerShell scripts to install everything, but would that work for Windows Server?
 Edit: To clarify, NTLite does work for Windows Server, but even that still requires me to click on the screen to start the install. It’s a lot less clicks, but still requires interaction with a monitor/keyboard.

 I want to know what CPU would you recommend. I read the max core count for dual cpu is 16 core but I have seen that some second hand shops sell this with a configuration of 2x E5-2680v2 (10 core per CPU). Did i misread or the 2013 boot block motherboard supports more than 16 core total?
 Also I was thinking of upgrading to 2x E5-2667v2. What are your thoughts? Thanks

There are some videos on a website (nsfw but irrelevant because its only the videos hosted on Netu.tv that are the problem) I'm trying to download that use Netu.tv as their host, and require the user to manually click a play button that shows up somewhere in a rectangular area (random spot so a bot couldn't click the center of the video area) before the video even loads into the site. I can't right click anything in the video player area, opening up developer tools causes the video to disappear without a trace in the "Elements" section, disabling JavaScript does nothing to stop the removal of said video once Developer Tools opens. JDownloader picks up nothing because the webpage its on has no video technically, only after the user's manual input does the Netu.tv media appear. Extensions on Google Chrome like CocoNut don't pick it up, even with "force download". Certainly someone amongst the data hoarding hivemind can find a way to fetch these videos? Preferably in their raw form and not just via screen-recording?

House is wired for UTP CAT5, and patch cables where used are UTP CAT6. CAT6 is used for two POE Unifi AP’s. The rack is wall mounted and the rack mount power strip is plugged into a UPS that sits on the floor, but will soon be wall mounted with a R720 server - very close to rack in question. There is a Unfii Dream Machine SE and QNAP NAS in the rack, both have three prong plugs. The POE ports on the DMSE will plug into patch panel and then continue on there way. 
 Do I need to ground the rack? Should I ground the rack? If I do, can I attach ground cable to the rack and bolts where DMSE connects to the rack where there is bare metal? I don’t see a grounding point on the rack - although might have missed it. If my situation doesn’t require grounding, is there a possible home lab/networking upgrade path where I would need to ground? Thanks in advance for any advice.

I’m still deciding between the two but I’m having trouble understanding how people download the movies and shows. Do people buy the movies/shows from somewhere? Do they pirate it? Where do people download their media from? I’ve seen YouTube videos where someone said some people turn their CDs to digital versions (onto Plex, Jellyfish, etc). But I’m not interested in owning the physical and digital copy. I do have services like Disney+, Hulu, etc. Do people somehow download the movies on there onto Plex/Jellyfish?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been wiring rooms in my house with some Cat 6 ethernet cables (20-30m) as I wanted some future proofing for 2.5Gbe, 5Gbe and potentially 10Gbe. Currently 10Gbase-T seems very demanding on amount of power draw and the cooling required for anything more than just a single port. I know there are fiber options but bending OM3 cables around corners fills me with dread.
 Just wanted to know is the power draw due to the amount of processing required to send and read data? Will power/heat come down in the future as we get more efficient/faster chips to the point where we can get affordable consumer grade switches/routers. Was transitioning from 100 mbe to 1 Gbe similar in that the power/heat was significant but came down over time?

 This one is annoying me! - There's a historic Youtube video that has been made unavailable for copyright - There are a few other copies on YouTube, but as I recall this was the only one that is in any decent definition.
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_8dafLxLcI
 On Wayback machine, it goes back to 2008, but those older versions all seem to want Flash and I can't work out how on earth to download them anyway. It's nice of Archive.org to have it archived, but if you can't use it, that's annoying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Following a family death I’ve ended up with about 400gb of data pulled from around a dozen mixed drives. I’ve transferred it onto my NAS and stored it in folders by source. (It was easier to harvest it into one location for my wife to pull some family photos from). The storage was chaotic!!! There were recent (i.e newish) drives that had some old stuff, but not all the old stuff, as well as some stuff that appears to be the only copy. Some drives even contained the same data multiple times buried in folders inside folders. 🤯
 I’m running synology DS920+. What’s the easiest way to pull data out by type and remove duplicates? E.g. pull all the photos out into a single folder. I don’t want to lose anything but I don’t need 40 copies of a school nativity from 20 years ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the title says it all. I am looking at the WD MyCloud 2bay Expert EX2 NAS. I currently have 2 separate 2tb externals hooked up to my Linux server and my wife directly backs her phones photos to it via the wifi network connection. Plus we stream some media and use it for backup files, etc. I currently run rsync to copy one HD to the other every few months for redundancy. One main feature I want in a NAS is the raid option so I don't have to continue to manually back up the redundancy.
 Is this a good device for me to upgrade to?
 Here is the link for Best Buy. Also, I'd love other suggestion but I need to stay at the $160ish price point.

They were easy fixes but I wanna check for more inconsistencies including file moves. However I don't wanna be checking through so many files one by one.
 I know windows explorer can list all files of a type, showing modification dates for each, but that doesn't include folders and there could be some file types I'm forgetting. Is there a software that would list everything for each hard drive, with the modification dates so I can go through and compare lists for both?
 Bonus points if they can list everything with a number, to make things even easier.

 last time I shucked an external drive years ago, they were pretty much WD Red drives. 
 I am planning to have one again as an internal drive.
 How is the situation now? Is it recommended? Does it have any downsides? Are they still red ones? Do I have to tape that one pin for both versions (Elements/My Book)?
 Do you suggest to buy other brands? I was pretty happy about WD Red ones but maybe there are better ones considering price-performance?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, as I have a bit of free time during the holidays, I'm beginning to think about building out some network infrastructure in my garage which mostly serves as a wood working workshop, but which also includes a workbench that I use for some minor experimentation with ham radio and electronics. I currently have two POE cables running into the room to power a pair of POE cameras that I use to monitor a feral cat that I feed inside, but I don't have any other cabling currently: it's a blank slate.
 Basic needs are perhaps six or so ports that are routed to my electronics bench, another four or so which are POE ports that I can use to power my existing cameras, plus an extension, and maybe an inexpensive 2.4G access point to provide more reliable access to some Tasmota sensors. I currently am using a https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GS211V9 hooked to my pfsense router, which may get repurposed out to the garage. 1GB networking is probably fine here, I'll probably create a subnet using one of the spare ports on my KingNovy pfsense box, which technically opens up the possibility of 2.5GB networking, but no device I'm likely to have in the garage 
 Has anyone else done something like this? I am interested in seeing other similar small network setups. The environment is likely to be fairly dusty (working on better dust collection in the shop, but again, that's another project). I'm probably going to build a small case to house the major bits, with just a small switch mounted to the workbench, with some little silicone dust caps to keep the worst of the dust out when not in use? 
 I recognize this isn't a very fancy project, but I'm interested in doing a better job than just laying cables around everywhere willy nilly.
 Thank you all for your advice!

 I am looking for a self-hosted low-cost or free solution to potentially replace Pulseway for me. I would like to find something that is along the lines of Pulseway I have tested tacticalrmm but the Linux agents are not free. I have also tried MeshCentral & Rport but they do not offer app installation or system monitoring. 
 Here are things that I would like to do :
 Windows & Linux agents .. mac optional not really needed. 
 Remote desktop access
 Remote file storage access
 Software management
 System recourse logging ( CPU, memory, storage, network )
 Powershell, CMD, Linux terminal to run scripts
 Patch management
 Notifications for events - high CPU / ram usage / offline device. 
 I do not mind running 2 solutions so long as they can be run and remote systems can communicate without the need for VPN.

 I am new to this community and the concept of self hosting. I’m trying to decide if it is better to hire a local company to setup or if this is something I can or should learn to handle myself. 
 I would rate my own skills between low and medium. i’ve built a couple gaming computers, i like to run mods on most games. i have a vpn on my phone, but honestly couldn’t tell you the technical side of what it does. i know i should have it on my router but i don’t. pretty basic stuff. I know very little about network architecture if that’s even the right term. Im reading through a couple DIY guides that seem to makes sense conceptually, but i am rapidly becoming overwhelmed with the technical jargon.
 The end goal is an outdoor surveillance that i can view from my phone and will give me notifications when movement is detected. i’ve been using nest but have not been impressed. Essentially that’s all the functionality i need, but might want some room to grow into automation.
 So my question is, is this worth it to push through this barrier to entry and learn or is this something best left to trusted professional? 
 what does something like this even cost in terms of hardware?
 are there any recommendations for a place to start? videos? Hell, i’ll even take book recommendations. 
 thanks for reading

 Currently, I am running Proxmox and have 4 VM + 4 LXC running on it. I have the following services: https://imgur.com/a/POaQFhG
 I want to have redundancy on my drives. I initially planned on installing OMV and using RAID5 config. for the drives. The machine will be used for media storage only. I have another machine for NAS stuff. I plan to backup all the media to Backblaze B2.
 I recently was in talks with a developer for Bazarr app, he suggested that I go with unRAID. So, I got a trail for unRAID. It's nice and simple. Few click here, few click there and you are done.
 I managed to mock migrate all my current services to unRAID docker containers just fine. Played around with caching too.
 After using it for about a week, I am still questioning whether it is a necessary purchase for me.
 My main questions are:
  
How different is unRAID's parity disk approach from RAID5?
 How reliable is OMV?
 Most importantly, do I need unRAID?

I feel like I have a decent grasp on Linux, I can vaguely understand how the internet works, I can follow installation guides for self-hosted stuff and look things up when I get stuck. But I still feel like a beginner, y'know? I don't know enough to start leaving holes in my firewall with 100% confidence that I won't get DDOSed or hacked or doxxed, so I don't. Everything I've made so far has either stayed in my private network or only been left open for a few hours at most. 
 Ideally I'd like to run a simple blog website, a VPN, maybe a Minecraft server, and maaaaybe a private Mastodon instance if I can handle it. I know all of this would have to be publicly exposed, so how do I go about publicly exposing servers safely? If this is still too advanced for the level I'm at (which I imagine it is), what's the best learning path for me to get there? Books, websites, tutorials, etc?
 Thanks for your help!

 Main Post
 I am a huge fan of using rclone with --backup-dir (docs) for backups.
 It is not the most efficient, most featureful, advanced, sexy, fastest, etc. of the different backup solutions. But it makes up for all of this in a key area: simplicity. 
 When it comes to backups, there is a lot to be said for being simple and easy. Easy to understand, easy to restore, easy to verify.
 However, there is a major problem with rclone backups: it needs to list the destination every time which can be very slow. (There are others too but this is the main one).
 So I created rirb: reverse incremental rclone…]]></summary>

 I'm a total newbee when it comes to DMS and I am looking for a little open source DMS that I can host in my home network with proxmox.
 The idea is to use the new scanner I just got that allows my to scan to 5 different network folders that I can predefine.
 What I want
  
pdfs should automatically be saved/converted to OCRed pdfs
 pdfs should be renamed yyyy_mm_dd (file created date)_FoldernameSomeNumber
 Client-Server DMS that let's me search for text fragments, ideally automatically reads the date from letters and puts in in a field, maybe the same for the title and idealy I can pre-configure some attributed that reoccruing letters have in order to apply certain tags, maybe even rename the documents etc.
  
Is that doable? Is it a reasonable approach?

I want to get evertyhing copied over from the existing one and I have dual 10gig NICs in each of them so I'd like to use that lane for the initial copy and subsequent scheduled backup.
 I have the 10gig interfaces configured like so for each server (only posting the image of one)
 ​
 https://preview.redd.it/hfpn8913b87a1.png?width=2358&format=png&auto=webp&s=a148539f3913b3b9c8480d1c5971d30690d9fece
 When I run iperf3 from one of them as the 'server' and the other as the 'client' I can't get more than 980 mbps for transfers. One thing to note: when I run the client command I use the IP of the other server, but it's not the IP of either of the above interfaces. If I try to call it with one of the 10gig IPs from the image above it just hangs there.
 So i feel like the issue with my test is that iperf3 isn't actually using the NICs for the transfer. Am I doing something wrong in iperf or in the setup, or both?

I just bought a 42u server rack, and I just upgraded one of my Dell Powervault DR4100 server with 192GB of memory. I also have a cisco catalyst 4948 switch as well. I was thinking of buying a Forigate Fortinet firewall, I have seen other people recommend untangle firewall as well. I have heard mixed reviews on both. I was wondering, If I am correct in saying, that if the license is expired, I cannot use most of the features. Including the web filtering feature. Is there any firewall I can buy off of ebay to either test or possibly implement down the road with that doesn't require a license to use these features?
 Thank you.

 (planing to run 3 in raidz1 for vms + logging and another 2 for caching)
 Since it should last as long as possible and the server is going to be used for extensive writing (logging as well as cache for some jbods/hdd pools) i am looking for at least 1pbw better 4+pbw lifespan.
 I already looked through used enterprise ssds on ebay for a couple hours but didnt decide yet.
 One that caught my attention is the Toshiba THNSN81Q92CSE (1.92tb for 120$) but i couldnt find any documentation regarding lifespan.
 Would it be a good choice?
 I also looked through many intel ones but got a bit confused regarding their naming (and vastly different endurance ratings according to the wikipedia article)
 What can you recommend?

 Machine Ryzen 5700x, msi b550m pro-vdh wifi, 16gb ram.
 pci sata card: https://www.startech.com/en-ca/cards-adapters/pexesat322i
 Drive 1x 500gb SSD, 3x3TB HDD, 1x1TB HDD
 Looking to run Proxmox, and virtualize unRaid purely as a NAS, and using proxmox as I need to virtualize a couple other environments.
 I did one pass and got everything up and running with proxmox install in xfs, however I want to encrypt all of the drives.
 Following the guide here I can encrypt the Proxmox install:
 https://herold.space/proxmox-zfs-full-disk-encryption-with-ssh-remote-unlock/
 ​
 However, I need a sanity check on what I need to do to make this work effectively:
  
Get another SSD, and install it zfs in raid1 on JUST the SSDs and encrypt the zfs
 Get a larger pci raid card and pass through the pci card with all drives to unRaid have unraid encrypt xfs / zfs and manage
 Get a 3rd SSD for a cache drive connected to the raid card, or can I virtualize this from extra space on the zfs drives
 Backup all my files from my VM's on unRaid
  
Option 2: Set all drives to ZFS (pool 0 - SSD) (pool1 - HDD) by proxmox and nas some other way.
 Option 3: Option 2 + Pass virtualized drives to unRaid? I think I lose access to smart data etc if I do it this way.
 My goal is just encrypted fault resistant storage of my VM's and Data.

I don’t even know where to begin.

 Any tips?

 Can I put more HDD’s in? Maybe some 2.5?
 If I set it up as a NAS now then decide later I want bugger HDDs can I just add them to the system or do I need to start a new instance of the NAS some how? 
 Lastly, TrueNAS scale or core ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, let me paint you a picture. :) So, I have an OpenMediaVault 6 server in the house, with some services like radarr, sonarr and so on, all in docker, with swag+duckdns for the reverse proxy setup, and that worked great, until a few days ago. In a thunderstorm, my modem and router died. I have my own modem, I don't use my ISP's modem. But now I have to, until I buy something new. So, now, with this modem I can't access my services outside the house. Not even from the house, I get this error when I test it from my PC:
 The connection has timed out
 The ports are forwarded. The weird thing is, my friend has the same setup, exept he has his own router, but he uses the same ISP modem, we are on the same ISP. I set up his OMV, everything, opened ports, all of it. And it works fine with him.
 I thought maybe the issue is because I'm using only the modem, without a router, because that's the only difference, but I had the same issue whenever I tried to swap modems, while I still had the router, during some testings and stuff.
 I've just checked the settings in his modem via AnyDesk, and they are literally the same. I can access his services from my house without issues.
 The modem is ZTE ZXHN H168N V3.1 .
 I don't know what else to post here, if you ask me I can post some screenshots or settings.
 Any ideas guys?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to the home lab environment and I am wondering whether I should get a managed or unmanaged switch. I have done some research before posting here but i am still unsure.
 I have read many articles saying that managed switched are useful for homes that have a lot of IoT devices, which I have a ton of (smart lighting, smart sockets and digital assistants in almost every room of my house). I don't know if the ability to create VLANs will be necessary for me as it will only be used for my main machine and 2 servers, one that will be running a webserver and a game server, each in its own docker container and then the other as a NAS.
 Based on this would it be worth getting a managed switch anyway, and spending the time learning the necessary network management skills, or just getting an unmanaged switch for the simplicity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 My homelab grows little by little, and I want to have access to it outside of my LAN, via VPN. Now, I could install Wireguard on my server, but I mess a lot with it, and it has big chance of being broken. More over, since it's a simple ThinkCentre that does not support wake-on-wan, theoretically I could lose connection in case of power outage while I'm away.
 So I'm looking for a dedicated device that will run only VPN, and maybe DNS (AdGuard Home). I could get a Pi for that, but I kind of don't understand their point. They are not cheap, and they run on SD cards which a prone to corruption (eventually).
 Another option is to run the VPN on my router, but Omada currently supports only OpenVPN and not Wireguard, and I have no idea when, or if, they will support it.
 I found this one GL.iNet - GL-MT2500 / Brume 2 which is in pre order and pretty affordable. It runs Wireguard and AdGuard home, and acts as both VPN server and client. I've heard about GL.iNet before, but I still worry about their reputation (although it seems they run mainly on open source software).
 Appreciate if someone can shed some light on that particular device or suggest something else.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey gang, I've spent a solid day of interspersed researching on these cards and found a lot of guidance that says these things usually have an LSI logo, but not neccesarily that its fake if it doesn't. I bought https://www.ebay.com/itm/155042469639 this card recently and it hasn't arrived yet, but I'd love to understand if there are any signs this is either legitimate or fake from the stock images.
 Particulary, it looks like it has the words "FastPCB" where I'd expect a logo to go. However, the seller has extensive and positive feedback (5 digits of positive). 
 The card itself looks to be an Inspur with a model #YZCA-00019-101 found on the back of the image. 
 I tried googling for this metadata and found nothing really to say yes or no for counterfeit signs or if the logo should be missing.
 Basically I'm struggling to reach a good stopping point here and would love this squad's advice on any and all analysis of this offering's legitimacy. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

 300+ full-color SVG icons of homelab-related software, products, and brands for use in dashboards, network diagrams, etc...
 https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets
 See a preview of all icons here
  
In my dashboards and network diagrams, I was using the already existing SVG icon sets (Simple Icons, Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, etc...), as well as random PNG/JPG files I found online. However, I always wanted consistently-sized full-color SVGs (instead of black/monotone or random PNG/JPG files).
 I gathered 300+ SVGs so far, and wanted to share them here.
 https://github.com/loganmarchione/homelab-svg-assets.
 I don't intend to replace any existing icon sets. Instead, I'm focused on homelab-related software, products, and brands ONLY.
 I have the following features so far:
  
Consistent viewbox (48x48)
 Optimized with SVGO
 Diagrams.net library (this is the reason I created this project)
 CDN (via jsDelivr)
 PHP (via Packagist)
 Node (via NPM)
 Hugo (via module)
  
Things I'm working on:
  
Adding more icons
 Gathering brand usage guidelines
 Gathering registered trademark (®) or trademark (™) symbols to be added
 Creating more automation for deployments
  
I created this for myself, but figured it might be useful here!

 ​
 Hi All, not sure if this is the best place to post, but thought I'd try.
 ​
 I'm rebuilding some of my VMs and am running into some permissions problems. I am able to write to the share with one VM, but not the other, with the built in user 'radarr'.
 ​
 Both the old (left) and the new (right) VMs have the same SMB share mounted to /mnt/media using cifs. The cifs credentials are the same in each VM and allows me to have full control of the data from TrueNAS under my admin user 'andrew'.
 ​
 You can clearly see in the picture that the permissions of the old VM are set as rwxrwxrwx, while the new is missing write for groups and other. I believe I may have used chmod -R 777 /mnt/media on the old VM, but I honestly can't remember and I'm not sure how to see this (I've since started documenting all changes I make and what they do so this won't happen in the future). I'd also prefer to not 777 an entire dataset, even if it is not sensitive data.
 ​
 I know I can fix this by changing the user running the service, but I want to keep the radarr service running as the user radarr as that is best practice for linux.
 ​
 Any help or pointing to an article I can read would be much appreciated.

 I'm Vihar from Appsmith, and I'm here to share a major update on Appsmith's release (1.8.11).
 Introducing Auto-height for Appsmith widgets—A top requested feature, Auto-height now flexes your Appsmith apps to dynamic changes in content, conditional visibility, and end-user screens.
 With this update,
 1️⃣ Text widgets now fold around the content inside. Smooth!
  
👌 unstructured content from databases like Snowflake, Redshift, and Firebase.
 😍 for social media dashboards, consumer survey analyses, and store reviews.
  
Auto-height for text
 2️⃣ Triggering the 𝚒𝚜𝚅𝚒𝚜𝚒𝚋𝚕𝚎 widget prop conditionally? Let’s take your white-space worries away.
  
for apps with sidebars, as shown in our example ↓.
  
Auto-height for conditionally visible blocks
 3️⃣ Auto-height-enabled widgets also change their size to change screen sizes.
  
for stock inventory updates, on-site checks, and forms for field teams.
  
Auto-height for the mobile-layouts
 4️⃣ What you see when building apps is what you get when viewing it, say, with Containers and the Canvas.
 Auto-height for the canvas
 What's next?
  
𝚖𝚒𝚗-𝚖𝚊𝚡 heights in widget props

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using a managed instance of Nextcloud for some time and it's worked quite well for me so far. But since I switched to Obsidian for notetaking, the lack of two-way sync in the Android client is a huge annoyance. 
 The corresponding issue on Github has been open since 2016 and even though there are a few hundred dollars bounty exposed, nothing is moving there.
 I don't even want to talk about the fact that two-way sync is the most basic feature of a cloud service.
 What can I do about it?
  
Using a third-party app like folder sync contradicts the whole privacy idea of having your own Nextcloud instance
 Switching to OneDrive together with an encryption app isn't really an option since I'd like to be able to access my files for example on my work machine where I can't install any encryption apps.
 Is there an alternative to Nextcloud which is able to do two way sync on Android and Windows?
 Any other ideas...?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/homelab,
 I've been deep in research for weeks now looking into all the possible ways to go for a home network rebuild. For a long time I was putting a high value on unified management / SDN solutions like Unifi or TP-Link Omada, but I am beginning to rethink that. It seems like both platforms have the kinds of drawbacks (support, hardware quality and availability, feature roadmaps that never materialize) that I would find endlessly frustrating as someone with a day job in IT.
 I know the sub is geared more toward learning and experimentation, and I value that too, but I have to balance that with reliability and availability of the network, particularly as I work remotely. Central management seemed very appealing for a no-nonsense setup, but now I am less sure that I will see long-term value from buying into such a stack.
 So I'm looking for input on this -- is the single pane management of something like Unifi or Omada worth the other headaches from these companies? Or would I be better served going with older "best of breed" enterprise equipment for switching and wireless, paired with something like pfSense for routing? I lose the central management, but it seems clear that I would have better hardware for similar expense.
 If you lean enterprise in your response, please mention what hardware you prefer for APs, switching, and routing. I would especially like to hear your opinions on mixed environments. ATM I am considering Ruckus AP / Aruba ION switching (local control) / pfSense as a potential build if dissuaded from Unifi or Omada, for example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/Homelab,
 I've recently come into 8x6TB WD Red drives and I plan to configure these all in RAID6. I've already got an LSI-9211 RAID card for the setup.
 My problem is that my case, which I otherwise love, doesn't have enough storage for 8 3.5" drives. Here's a link to the specs of the case that I have and it only has 4 internal 3.5" bays. I'm okay with removing any or all of the 2.5" bays or the 5.25" bays if needed, but I haven't found a suitable storage method for what I would put in place for those drives.
 Has anyone had experience or luck expanding storage in their homelab? Are there any other concerns I should be aware of? I know heat may be an issue, but there are two 80mm fans directly in front of the drive bays, and the processor is watercooled by a Swiftech H220 so the internals of the computer don't get too hot as it's configured now.

 I'm in the market for 4x 2tb NVMe Gen4. Going to put them in a PCIe NVMe bay eventually. Do these specs check out? Only think I'm worried about is how drives tend to slow down over time.Not sure how important VNAND is compared to TLD, QLC, cache etc., in regards to speed and longevity.This price and speed seem too good to be true. All these drives are just for storage, OS will be on a Samsung Pro.
 Also, these drives will solely be used for music production and reading, not writing; loading many heavy files/samples simultaneously, if that helps.

I kind of miss having users. What could I self host and actually have some users? I've got servers collecting dust and gigabit up/down, but I've just got no actual motivating ideas. Does anyone still know what a bbs is/was? What is the modern day equivalent? Infotainment, messagey, with games. Can run on window, linux, most databases, anything. Mastodon was fun for like a day. Fun enough to pay 11 bucks for a domain to test it, but nah, too specific. Something that can still be fun without a ton of users, couple hundred might be nice.

 I've come into an offer for a r210 II and I've read good things about it, but i was wondering if it is old info and if there are currently better options.
 I have several vlans and unfortunately my switch showed as a fake L3 one, so i need inter-vlan routing at router level. But i also seek for low power consumption, as my homelab runs on sun power. 😎
 I bought two NUCs, but they simply didn't seem good to use them for pfsense. I repurposed them as Iot machines.
 Thanks guys for your suggestions 🙂
 Edit: Ah, and I'm running it on a stick, i would put a 10gbe card on it.

 I am looking for a self hosted content management website where we can control mentioned content above, I have some requirements.
  
No SSO behind a stupid paywall (LDAP can work too)
 A good REST API
 Ability to customize the software so I can hook it up with a custom library I made in Node that connects to our cloud service and creates folders for those songs/avatars/playlists (basically a way to hook it up when a content gets CMUD)
  
I have tried Strapi, it was an OK solution but not having an SSO and not being able to customize the routes to add my library was a minus.
 I tried PayloadCMS for a while and the team used it but I had to implement my own SSO which would get erased by each update to come. I like how it had a good REST API and how customizable it was but it looked very unfinished and the GUI was really empty.
 Ability to use the software in Docker compose would be a plus.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to NAS stuff and have an ASUSTOR AS1102T 2 bay NAS. Been using it quite smoothly for the past month. Then I attempted an experiment. After making sure all data is backed up, I powered off the NAS, took out the hard drive, and plugged it into a windows computer. I wanted to see if it’s possible to see the files directly on a desktop (because I intend to use hard drives as Cold Storage as I don’t have much to spend on NAS with many bays). To no avail, windows didn’t recognise it. Also ran a quick health check and all sectors green. I plugged it back into the NAS (another SATA port) and booted up the NAS, but it showed disk errors. I powered off the NAS, and switched the hdd to the original port, and booted it up again, but was met with disk errors again. 
 So my questions are: 1) are NAS hdd supposed to be allowed to be plugged out? 2) when they are plugged back in, does port matter? 3) will windows “corrupt/override” the file system that the NAS has written?
 I believe the answer to at least one of these is the reason for the results of my experiment. It would be disappointing if (1) turned out to be “no”, as that was my intended usage. What do you guys think? :)
 Perhaps I need to click on “repair” as mentioned here? https://www.reddit.com/r/synology/comments/ijbac9/disk_drive_order/g3chu61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I’m fairly new to data hoarding and it’s not something I’ve been able to do much due to Wi-Fi bandwidth caps, but now I’m on a plan with much higher bandwidth with a pretty eh download speed (which is capped to max 50mbps)
 I have a 1 TB ssd, a 1 TB HDD in my laptop (no pc atm), and a 5 TB external HDD. I bought a 2012 Dell OptiPlex 790 earlier this year and have regretted buying it ever since. I can’t sell it since no one would pay for what it cost me. $50 for the machine itself and little over $100 to get it shipped to me, I don’t live in the western world and the OptiPlex came from the US.
 The OptiPlex has a single hard drive bay and seeing as it is from a decade ago, I doubt m.2 ssd is an option. Came with a 4 GB stick and a user here or over in the NAS subreddit recommended that I get either 8 or 16 GB which I’m planning on doing.
 But the main issue at hand is using hard drives. Now, the option that I’ve been considering for a while is using external hard drive dock. Would any of you recommend me going this route or should I count my losses and look for another option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some backstory before the question:
 I've had some suspicious activity in my neighborhood lately. I have some outdoor facing PoE cameras on my network that are currently accessible to the internet so we can view them when not home (using BlueIris). I've been doing some more networking at work and want to really isolate everything correctly on my home network. Separating the cameras and BlueIris VM onto their own vlan, setting up routes to only allow certain IPs to connect, things like that. I think it would be good exercise to learn more on networking along with properly securing my network.
 The end goal is to view the RTSP streams of the cameras on a single monitor without having to RDP into my blue iris VM. Being able to do that without having to do anything except start the device would be great too, but thats more of a wish because I don't know if it is possible yet.
 I've been looking at Thin-Clients like a Dell Wyse 3040 or an HP T620 to view camera streams either through VLC or to just load a webpage that is hosting the RTSP streams on. I see a lot of raspberry pi suggestions online for my use-case, but the shortage and prices make it completely out of the question. I want to have this device on the same vlan as the cameras/BlueIris VM/Webserver hosting the streams, only connected to a monitor so my non-tech-savy other half doesn't have to do anything but turn the monitor on. 
 The question:
 Has anyone used thin-clients to achieve something similar? I don't think viewing the streams is that resource intensive, but I don't have any experience with thin-clients. Are they are powerful enough to view all the streams at the same time, whether on VLC locally, or viewing them on a webpage? I figured I would take a shot in the dark and ask before spending anything on this idea.
 Thank you for reading and considering my rambling

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short, cygwin is a great niche project but it doesn't keep all the versions online and thus Win systems that go EOL get unsupported.
 That is a shame as one may still want to use old system for vintage projects, fortunately there is one project, the cygwin time machine, that tries to save all the notable releases.
 http://www.crouchingtigerhiddenfruitbat.org/Cygwin/timemachine.html
 The question is, that site may go down (because internet forgets, not immediately, but it does), are there p2p resources to keep mirrors of it alive?
  
Edit: a bit surprised by the downvotes. I though the sub was for trying to save things, also (especially?) niche things that are legal to share, rather than mostly "download a lot of Linux ISOs that at the end are pirated films". I guess that it mostly dedicated to mainstream data and I expected a bit more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen people ask in the past about the power difference going from v3 to v4 processors, so I wanted to share my experience, your results may vary this is just what happened with my particular TrueNAS Scale server.
 For starters, it's a Dell T-7910 with 128GB of DDR4 ECC memory, 4x6TB WD Red's and 4x800GB Intel DC S3610 SSD's, a Quadro K2200 for the o/s and Quadro P600 video card passed thru to a vm and an Asus quad nvme card with 2 Samsung 1TB 970 evo's. Currently running TrueNAS Scale 22.02.4 with a few apps and a few vm's running game servers and plex, this is not idle power as my system is never truly idle.
 When it had dual E5-2630l v3 processors it averaged 23% cpu utilization as reported by TrueNAS and was pulling on average 165 watts as reported by a kill-a-watt
 With the dual E5-2620 v4 processors installed with the same apps and vm's running, TrueNAS reports 12% utilization and kill-a-watt is reporting 148 watts on average. 
 I thought this would be a decent comparison since both of these models are 8 core 16 thread cpu's, however there is a small difference in clock speeds. 1.8 on the L version v3 and 2.1 on the v4. the L version also has a tdp of 55 watts where the v4 has a TDP of 85 watts. The v3 is a Haswell and the v4 is a Broadwell. 
 These were averages over a 24 hour period of normal use, so all in all it saved only 17w doing the upgrade to the newer processors under my particular use case. These are approximations and not scientific by any means but just wanted to share my results.

Was about to upgrade one nas to 20tb using a wd sale assuming similar experience …however heard some chatter about some noise issues. Either the design of the drive itself isnt the same experience, or i heard theres some new feature around lubrication causing some noise?
 Anyway, anyone with low noise requirements upgrade any of their nas units to 20tb and been happy? If not why?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok... so I need some help here.
 I'm planning on upgrading my UNRAID setup.
 Currently I have 24TB total, 10TB free.
 I've got two newer 8TB drives as parity (one shucked, one WD Gold). The rest of the drives are junky sas/sata used drives from ebay 3TB each.
 These drives are all in a Supermicro CSE-846 case, Supermicro X9DR3-F mobo with Dual Xeon E5-2620's 2.00GHz
 I am moving to a single e5-2680v3, probably going to spring for a Fractal Define R5 (unless you have other recommendations?)
 ANYWAYS,
 So I'd like to basically rebuild the whole NAS while I'm at this. What does that mean? Well...
 I'm unhappy with the 3TB drives. They are too noisy and suck up too much power for what they are. I'd like to replace them with a couple 8 TB drives, or maybe even redo my parity setup?
 I really like having dual parity. I know it would be cheaper to just go to single parity but I feel like dual is worth it?
 I guess what I'm wondering is if I should upgrade my parity drives to 12-14TB, and then just buy at least one more 8 TB drive
 OR
 Just get 3 8TB drives and go from there.
 I REALLY won't need all the storage I currently have right away as I plan on reorganizing and starting my linux ISO collection from scratch, so I can slowly acquire drives as needed (outside of parity of course)
 ​
 Recommendations on strategy, specific drives, and cases would be super awesome!
 ​
 Thanks!

 This is kindof a mixed post asking for some specific answers to get me on my way for this particular project, but also looking for resources to study up for the future. No pressure to run the gauntlet on all these questions, I am just grateful for any help you may offer.
 My lingering questions include:
  
Is it worth it to break a large archive into parts, or is it best to leave it as one archive? If its better to break it into parts, what is the best practice volume size all things considered? (I will have this archive backed up on mac, windows and linux machines, online, and will be distributed to a handful of people).
 
Is there a in depth user level best practices resource on file compression? Something that outlines use cases i.e. best method for speed com…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys.
 I am trying to set up a self hosted server on my rasp. My Nginx server is running on docker and listening on port 80 and [::]:80 with a simple index. I bought a domain name too in which I used an AAAA record type to use the IPv6 address of the raspberry itself as my provider is using cgnat and I don't have a unique public ip for port forwarding etc. I can access the domain from all devices in my local network without a problem, my index page is showing up fine. However when I try to access it from the public, for example using my network data or from another network, chrome either doesn't load (from mobile data) or throws DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN (at least to the network my friend tried).
 I have enabled ufw in my server with opening port 80 to the public as well as allowing forwarding to docker and adding the rules found in https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker. Dns seems to be completely propagated. Even if I disable ufw, the situation remains the same and no log is showing up when I access it from outside when the firewall is enabled.
 My nginx conf:
 server {
 listen 80;
 listen [::]:80;
 server_name example.com www.example.com;
 root /usr/share/nginx/html/;
 index index.html; }
 and firewall rules related to port 80:
 80 on eth0 ALLOW Anywhere
 80 (v6) on eth0 ALLOW Anywhere (v6)
 80/tcp ALLOW FWD 192.168.1.0/24
 80/tcp ALLOW FWD Anywhere
 80/tcp (v6) ALLOW FWD Anywhere (v6)
 Even when I try to get a certificate from LetsEncrypt I get The Certificate Authority failed to download the temporary challenge files created by Certbot.
 Do you have any idea what misconfiguration could be on my side or what the problem could be?

 Apologies if this is the wrong place or way to ask for this help, but I need help from here for my college project, please take 3-5 mins from your time if you can :)
 I'm writing a research paper about a Fixed Cost Cloud service model where initially the user will be allotted 1Gbps as is the norm, and after 1TB (or whatever the plan might be), the user will be throttled to 50Mbps, but they won't be billed for the Transfer.
 I'm empathizing with needs of a self hosted community, a small business or a student professional whose bandwidth needs might not be a lot and the traffic is in small chunks, but they're paying the cloud providers for their Bandwidth Over usage.
 I need your advice for this project. I know it cannot work for everyone, Hence I need your response and suggestions for this.
 We (me and my batchmate) have also launched a Google Form and we'll be glad if you could take the small time to fill that.
 https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfBLf8M4uIy4SwSbFZkCKfEhjp49-BPeCX6IlFikfhGUqAu0g/viewform
 Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you :))

 I'm a student at a university that's located a bit far from the city, and the WiFi and mobile data connections here are really spotty. On a good day, we might get 10-15 Mbps at best, and it's really inconsistent, especially in the dorms. The university library does have a wired fiber connection that gives us 200 Mbps+ on average, but the issue is that they have a Sophos Proxy/Firewall setup that blocks a lot of entertainment websites like Netflix, Prime Video, and Disney+. YouTube is still accessible, though.
 I have a problem where I need to update Microsoft Flight Simulator (40 GB worth of updates!) and work with my personal NextCloud Drive, which would sync a lot faster with the faster internet connection at the library. I use Tailscale and an Nginx Proxy Manager to manag…]]></summary>

 I simply don't have the self-discipline to use the peicemeal approach for long before giving up and just throwing things on my drives.
 So I know I need a program that at the very least holds my hand as I archive data, I was wondering if such a useful software might exist?

 Ideally, I would write all the backed up files to a text file, then tell 'rsync' to exclude all the files and directories in that file. Certainly I'm not the first one, so curious how others have done this? TIA

The plug that comes with the server is 3 prong type B.
 Do I need to get an electrician to change anything? The breaker for that outlet on my breaker box says 120/240v. Will it already provide 240v power to this outlet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask in, but I give it a go.
 I’m soonly deploying a truenas scale server with a couple of petabytes with data. On this server, unrelated to the data, I want to host a centralized email client. Primarily client. It maybe sounds weird, but it makes sense for my situation. To make a long story short, in bullet points what I am searching for:
 — Self hosted centralized email client
 - Readily available apps on different platforms (android, ios, ipados and preferable ubuntu/windows/etc)
 - The client has to have compatibility with exchange, google mail, smtp/imap/pop3 mailservers located elsewhere and the client also needs a server attached to serve some domain names with a mail server itself.
 ​
 The idea, in more practical terms, is to have really all the email en adresses in one place that can be accessed from anywhere. For example: if I grab a new device somewhere (shared pc, new phone on the airport, a borrowed ipad on a site somewhere, etc); I just want to be able to grab the accompanying app or use the web interface and have access to all my mails and mail adresses (from and for very different sources).
 ​
 I have looked at quite a few solutions, but nothing I found until now did have everything I need. For now I just manage many different adresses and some are loaded in some devices, some aren’t; some I just only use the web gui for the specific purpose it has. I just want to centralize everything and be able to use whatever device I can grab wherever I am to get the work done that needs to be done.
 ​
 Sorry for the long post and let me know if I overlooked some service or result or if I missed something in the rules of this sub reddit.
 ​
 Ps. Things like 2 auth and sorting/categorizing/GTD and so forth are also nice to have, and probably important. But these things pale in comparison to the functionality I‘m looking for described as above

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Not sure if you know about what's been happening with Trakt these last couple of days. They had some sort of database crash and it's taking several days to recover (and it seems that data's been lost).
 Now, with the service offline, I noticed how dependent I am of it. So I was thinking about possible similar selfhosted solutions. What I'm looking for is something that:
  
May import my current history from Trakt (in fact not being a VIP user I still don't know if Trakt allow history export).
 Allow Kodi scrobbling (that's important, since I manage all my media library through Kodi and it has a Trakt addon, making it trivial to automatically sync everything I watch).
  
I found this project (MediaTracker) that I installed a couple of days ago and seems very promising, but it apparently has no way to automatically sync from Kodi.
 Do any of you could suggest any alternative?

 My current issue with cyberduck is for some reason, it uses much more CPU compared to other programs. The issue with carotDAV is it only upload files one by one even if you dump in a bunch of files, which I cannot max out my connection.
 To what I understand, rclone doesn't fit my needs. If anyone knows how to setup rclone to work like I how I need it, I would happily use rclone. Filezilla Pro doesn't have a trial so I can't test how well it would work for me.
 ​
 Are there any alternative programs on windows for this use case or how do I properly setup rclone for this use case? I'm ready to learn.
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I hope this type of post is not considered off-topic here. I have read the rules and I think my question is appropriate for this sub-reddit.
 First of all, this is my very first post in this subreddit 😄
 I have a question relating to server racks i.e. server rack cases specifically.
 I'm not in the position to afford expensive server computers that are rack mountable, and even if I could, it would be unreasonable for my use case.
 What I wanna do is "migrate" (I have some servers in a normal desktop tower case) my existing hardware into a setup that is rack-mountable.
 So, I wanna buy a rack cabinet (10" or 19" doesn't really matter to me) and put my "cheap" desktop gear into it.
 I have searched the internet for "server rack cases" and I've found some matches, but they're generally quite tall and bulky.
 There also seem to be cases that are rack-mountable, but they don't have any mount points for, like let's say, a motherboard.
 My existing servers all have an ATX sized motherboard, if possible I'd like to keep them.
 Are there cheap "desktop" (preferably slim) cases that are made to be mounted in a rack cabinet?
 (I know that "desktop" PC and "rack mountable case" are a bit mutually exclusive, why would a normal user want to have their PC in a rack :D)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My dad passed recently, and he left behind a treasured collection of 5,000+ CD's. I'd like to archive it all as I have many fond memories of listening to them; MP3's are sufficient.
 I was originally thinking of setting up something similar to this, with many drives. Problem is my main machine which has the space and processing power is at my own home; moving either the machine or the CD's between my house and my dad's isn't practical, and the work involved in setting it up starts to sound blocking.
 I also considered just cataloguing them and feeding that into a torrent/Usenet/purchasing script, but many of these are old and do not exist online (and are not sorted), so that doesn't sound any faster.
 How do you suggest I go about this? I'm open to jerry-rigging something together, buying a commercial solution, etc, just not sure what's most efficient. My biggest constraint is I don't get much time at his house, so I want a solution with a high CD throughput. Should I just be ripping images, and then transporting those to my own home for transcoding/tagging/etc?
 Thanks all!
 EDIT: As many of you have mentioned, tagging and metadata is a big problem, especially since many of these CD's have no online presence and can't be auto-tagged. Since the CD's aren't sorted (and I don't want to upset the physical state of things too much), retrieving a disc after ripping isn't feasible. So whatever strategy is used needs to record disc data (e.g. photographs of the case) when it's ripped.

 I really would like to get a small PC/SBC with 2-4 ethernet ports and 2.4GHz WiFi with a decent range to load OPNSense on. Something like the ODroid H3+ is attractive, but it seems like overkill for JUST a router (I'd definitely reach for it if I were building a combo router-NAS), and I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions that had a lower price-point and/or more ethernet ports.
 I don't need massive range, mesh network BS, and I'd rather use as much FLOSS as possible.

The server has about 20TB of data on it at the moment
 ​
 I do have a server locally with Proxmox installed, however the high capacity drives are out of my price range at the moment
 ​
 Is there anything I can do to improve throughput? I thought about getting a cloud storage solution and mounting it via SMB or some other protocol to a Linux machine within my Proxmox however I'm unsure what solutions are available to me apart from buying high capacity drives and then cloning the Hetzner box
 ​
 I would ideally like to stream old game ROMS to emulators and such via the solution

It was packed decently well but I guess not well enough. I have to wait until tomorrow to start the return process. 
 Originally I thought it must be a bum external drive dock so tried popping it in my single drive synology to test and it wouldnt show up at all. Glad I didnt jump straight into degrading the pool it is supposed to go into.
 Are there any tips for making sure I get a replacement quickly and efficiently? I am planning on returning the drive to newegg under the replacement option rather than RMA through Seagate.

 There are tons of models for each vendor and except vantec I dont know others. I've seen some vantec products - I have and old pata nexstar, it's still doing the job when needed), but some amazon clients' online reviews seem to say that old quality has gone (and they cost 3x, compared with other firm).
 I had two sabrent but after a couple year, one after another, stop to work.
 Plus: they should work good with linux and ssd disks, some chip may have trim problems (sob). It seems so complicate build an external 2.5 usb disks (I dont trust the ones sale by wd or seagate or toshiba... there are hdd smr disk; I also prefer to not buy a "usb ssd" like Sandisk Extreme, because they are a finished product and I cannot shuck them or change the disk, if needed).
 Some one of you has tested / evaluated these case? Should I evaluate a solution like the FANTEC QB-35US3R. Please note I would not buy a NAS, I have already have enough pc (family says...) and they are too expansive.
 Thanks a lot for reporting you experiences!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I've made a diagram illustrating what I am preparing to set up this week to try and make my thoughts clearer. I'm new to network diagrams so please be forgiving where I've missed obvious conventions & if possible let me know so I can work on this in future.
 My aim:
  
Back up my synology to a remote site (friends house) (as part of 321 backups) onto my Truenas Server
  
On my network side:
  
Run a wireguard docker container on my server
 Using IPTables, add a route to dynamicDNS setup for Friends network ("superprivate".duckdns.com) to go via wireguard docker network. I will be broadly following this guide: https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/routing-docker-host-and-container-traffic-through-wireguard
 All other connectivity will be routed out to the internet without this VPN in place
  
On friends side:
  
Run WG-easy inside Truenas docker app to run as VPN server
 Run duckdns inside Truenas docker app to share dynamic IP
 Run piVPN on raspberry pi as backup VPN server should something go majorly wrong with my Truenas primary VPN server
  
Questions:
  
Please can you comment on my design above and let me know any shortcomings/improvements?
 My biggest unknown in the above is probably the IPTables changes to NAT, to control what connections end up where.
 The Raspberry Pi will run PiVPN as a backup for my truenas container. I'll be several thousand miles away for a few years so want to ensure I can access my truenas just incase things go very wrong. Any issue running two vpns on the same network?
 I've written some bash scripts utilising rsync to push from my synology to the truenas. As my bash scripting is a bit rusty, is it reccomended to use rsync *service* to push directly to my truenas rather than relying on my scripting?
  
Many thanks if you've read through this far :)

 The rack is on wheels and needs to be moved about a bit in a tight space to replace equipment now and then, so some "slack" in the fibre is needed? 
 Do I run the fibre along the floor and up into the rack? That seems to be asking for trouble. 
 Do I try and dangle it from the ceiling into the rack on some hooks?
 Why don't they make fibre in old-school-curly-phone-handset style ;)

 I have loaded with Ubuntu 22.04 server and have been running Plex server and Foundry VTT via docker. Using SFTP / FileZilla for simple file storage. Also working to self host static site with Caddy and Porkbun. Having some learning trials getting things from local to public. 
 I am wanting to reconfig a bit and need some suggestions. Some items I have been considering:
  
update RAM from 8gb to 16gb
 add additional SSD for boot drive and use full 1TB HDD as storage only
 TBD add external Nvidia GPU
 get a short floor case / shelving to house PC and boot drives
 TBD power backup (storm season in my area)
  
Any suggestions on SSD / Nvidia shelving combos? What other upgrades for this server have I not considered? Not looking to buy expensive NAS, routers, or racks at this time. (Moving in April so my setup is temporary-ish)
 Any advice as I reconfig my boot drive and migrate? I may be early enough that I could just start from scratch but prefer to learn migration process.
 I’m going to post a separate post on my hosting challenges lol.

 I'm not very familiar with server hardware, but as far as I understand I have to buy a Drive Caddy for each drive I'm going to use to keep them in place.
 I looked for caddies on the same website where the server is, and I found these: https://www.interbolt.eu/en/spd/009666/Dell-PowerEdge-SFF-2-5-Cover-Blank-Caddy-Filler-De
 They're way less expensive than these trays I found on the same website: https://www.interbolt.eu/en/spd/007596/Dell-PowerEdge-SFF-2-5-SAS-SATA-HDD-Hot-Swap-Tray
 Now my question is: are cover blank caddy fillers just something to cover empty drive slots? Is there a way to use them with a Hard Drive? If not, do I really have to buy the more expensive caddies?
 Thanks A LOT in advance!

 After a long hiatus due to work and personal issues, I'm back to building my first homelab.
 A quick recap: I'm building a moderate size physical cluster consisting of 9 m-ITX blades each with an i3-10105T, 32Gb DRAM and 512Gb NVME boot drive. Two of the blades have four 2.5" hot swap bays in which I'll have a total of eight 2Tb SSDs.
 There are also two mini-PCs (Bee-link Gti11s that are i5-11s with 16Gb DRAM and 512Gb NVME boot drive). One of them will be a dedicated pfSense firewall (have to use the development build of pfSense 2.7 so it will recognize my i225 NICs) and the other will be running Ubuntu Desktop for an inside the lab management interface.
 When I say inside the lab, I want the everything from the pfSense FW down on its own IP range …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm after a solution to my dire photo management skills. I've got 20k photos on a server. Lots of crud. I'd like to thin the herd a bit.
 I'm looking for a way to go through them on the phone and delete as I swipe through. Ideally it would be swipe->delete->swipe->keep->swipe->delete etc. The process has been surprisingly difficult to come across.
 On the desktop, it's fine. I can use the file manager, but with kids, work, etc, i might not get to the desktop as often as i'd like which is where the phone would come in. I'm after an android app that can see the photos on the server amd delete/keep as is my wont. I don't require organisational tools, or AI, or tagging, or sharing or anything like that. 
 Simple delete/keep->next, repeat ad nauseum. It doesn't have to be a gallery app, maybe a file manager would work, but the thumbnail/preview caching might be problematic.
 I don't know. There are plenty of photo management apps, but really i'm looking for an image previewer and delete button without having to confirm every single time.
 The photos themselves can be in a samba share/ftp/nextcloud instance, doesn't matter, but access from the phone to quickly delete would be incredibly helpful.
 Any ideas appreciated. Thanks.
 Afterthought: I'd be aiming for something from fdroid, but at this point I may have to forego the opensourceness.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I wasted my whole weekend. All I wanted to do is create a REST API I could develop a mobile app against. This is the first programming work I’ve done for myself in ages and is widely outside the scope of the kind of work I do for clients. I’m interested in spring because the overtime I’ve been doing has been on a spring project. 
 I found this example by Baeldung after running into dead-ends with other tutorials:
 https://github.com/Baeldung/spring-security-oauth
 It’s not setup for SSL or running outside of local dev environment. So that’s where I spent my Sunday. 
 I eventually got everything besides actually being able to log out to work. Also technically still have to figure out how disable the management console being reachable from outside the host. 
 Surely there must be a secure, ready to deploy default that can be extended, right? 
 Am I expecting too much to be done for me?

 I would like to make some docker containers accessible from outside of my home. After some Googling, it seems that hosting a VPN seems the way to go. I wanted to double check if that is the best path forward:
  
ddclient for Dynamic DNS (would you use a free service like afraid.org?)
 wireguard for the actual VPN

 Am I missing anything else? I will be running both of those servers in docker.

 i tried searching but could not find a simple and realistic comparrison showing that NAS disk are really better for desktop storage.
 it's mostly for flac and wave music, png, svg and jpg images and mkv, avi and mp4 movies going to migrate to (03) 4tb hard disks , so actually i need to buy 6 for backup reasons, 
 i keep hearing i should buy the seagate ironwolf instead of barracuda, and begs the quesiton if its not overkill? with 6 drives i would spend u$ 120 more with ironwolf. from what i read NAS drives are made to run hot and not get affected from vibrations. isn't that because nas drives are all cramped together in a tiny box?
 so in a big server case both vibrations and temperature will not be a concern right?
 my computer runs rather cold, hard disks usually around 30~35 celsius, (a big old server case from the 2000's) 
 thanks!
 ps: not raid, just manual backup using software that does incremental copy

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought 3 identical machines with the initial idea of running SeaweedFS or maybe CEPH or some other type of distributed filesystem.
 Now I'm doubting if I should make more use of the hardware and also add them as docker nodes in my swarm. What would the performance impact be on my filesystem? Could docker somehow get in the way of the filesystem? What are the security implications of running docker containers alongside my filesystem?
 It seems like a waste of resources to only use the 3 machines as filesystem, doesn't it? I am planning to host quite a lot of mini-websites in docker in the future, it's something to keep in mind, but they can be migrated quite easily provided there is shared storage.
 What would you do in this case?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 In my homelab, I have a synology NAS that has docker running on it with a bunch of containers. One of those containers is a NGINX reverse proxy. Currently, the various UIs for a number of containers, as well as for the synology itself, are running over http. It's all internal, so it's not the end of the world if it isn't https, but I'd like to fix it so that everything does use https. I've noticed in some cases that chrome assumes that sites are https and that things don't work as a result.
 The problem is, none of these things are exposed to the open internet (and I don't want to expose them), so it looks like Let's encrypt is out. Further complicating things, their hostnames are all configured to be subdomains of my main domain (which does have a website out there with a Let's Encrypt cert on it). What's the sanest approach here?
 1) Do whatever shenanigans Let's Encrypt needs at the domain level to get a wildcard cert? What would I need to do to keep child domains updated in this case?
 2) Make a self-signed certificate and trust it on all my devices. How hard will it be to keep NGINX updated with this cert?
 Just needing a bit of guidance here, because when I've dealt with certs, it has either been in a production web environment with a "real" certificate authority or it has been Let's Encrypt provided by a webhost. Not sure what to do in a homelab.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using gallery-dl to download media and metadata for a list of people I follow. However, despite using an archive file, it still iterates through their entire tweet history. It does skip downloading old tweets, but I'd rather it just get everything new and then move onto the next URL once it encounters a tweet it already has. That would save me a TON of time (and rate limits).
 All the documentation and suggestions I've found thus far involve skipping downloads, which it's already doing.
 Also, since moving to a new computer and setting things up again, files it already downloaded are displaying as ./gallery-dl/twitter/[user]/? in the terminal output instead of showing the filenames. Not sure why that is happening.
 Config is below. Any suggestions?
 { "extractor": { "twitter": { "cookies": { "auth_token": "[redacted]" }, "archive": "~/twitter/archive-twitter.sqlite3", "postprocessors": [ { "name": "metadata", "event": "post", "filename": "{tweet_id}.json" } ], "expand": false, "cards": false, "quoted": false, "retweets": false, "text-tweets": false, "unique": true, "videos": true, "timeline": { "strategy": "media" } } } } 
 I run with the following command: gallery-dl -c ./gallery-dl.no-text.conf -i urls.txt

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm relatively new to self hosting, and I've read lots of guides and there is something I can't get my head around. Usually people have a reverse proxy for most of their services, so they can be accessed outside of the home network. What I don't understand is - say you have something like radarr.yourdomain.com - it doesn't seem to difficult for someone to guess that URL. If they do, then all that's left stopping them from accessing your services is the authentication from each service. I have been using wireguard for accessing my services outside my home, and it works quite well, and it seems more secure given how big the private keys are etc? I understand using a reverse proxy for a media server, in case you want to share with others or on devices that you can't use a VPN client, but why have it for the other more "private" services?
 Thank you very much!
 Edit: Thank you everyone, that makes sense. As for reverse proxies, is it considered secure to use the services own single authentication, like radarr and sonarr, or is it recommended to set up something more complex like authelia? Of course running with SSL.

 I don't get what's imposing the limitation though - it's the same controller, same power - what is there to stop me from putting 2x 16 TB drives in there? Or is it just a hard-limit set by WD for whatever reasons and the NAS simply will not boot with such drives?
 One theory is that the "advertised" capacity is what it is, going by the maximum available HDD size at that time. I can't confirm that though.
 I'd like to find out if maybe someone's already tried it before I buy the drives. Thoughts ?

 I'm looking for a solution to use to store about 2 TB of data (family photos and videos backup) online that does not require me to install an application to do so.
 I've looked at some of the other posts here and have an idea of the major suppliers already, but not which ones offer an option to just map a drive (open to any protocols sorted by linux).
 Does anyone else have this use case and doing this with a provider, please?
 Ideally I'll go with the cheapest cost/year. I don't want nor need anything fancy, just storage space I can map to have another backip of family photos and videos. 
 Thank you in advance.
 Ps- I asked iDrive and tgey responded that I must have their app installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I make this post to get an update of current state of the storage technology and also seek to find answer for wheather i should make backups to HDDs vs SSD.
 Current Situation:- I have around 500 gb of Family photos from 2001 on a Seagate external HDD, it lasted for 7 years and data is well and good right now.
 I already have backups on 2 different machines and the external HDD. It's now time again to migrate my external HDD to new Hardware and I am conflicted on what should I choose moving further.
 Until now my photos have been jumping CDs to HDD and I am at a crossroads again weather to switch from HDD to SSD or HDD are still better for cold storage long term.
 I did fair bit of research and I am aware Optical Media would be my best bet, namely M Disk or BD disks. Unfortunately where I live I cannot source them reliably and affordably enough.
 I browsed reddit threads from past few years. Like this from 2 years ago which says SSDs are better.
 I have consistently found a narrative that newer SSDs are better alternative than HDDs.
 My primary concern is not number of read writes in SSDs. Often they are in 100s of TBW which I presume I won't hit because of the nature of my storage needs.
 I fear data corruption and chip failure rather than running out of read writes.
 The disk I chose weather SSD or an HDD will probably be left on shelf with about twice a year plugging into PC to add new photos.
 What do you guys think would be a good choice ?
 Should I keep moving forward with a new HDD or are SSD a smarter choice?
 Whatever I choose I would probably rely on for at least next 4-5 years, with backups of course.

 as my NAS is a bit dumb (ie Synology locked it down to only install something from their package manager), I was hoping to use my Raspberry Pi as a Jellyfin server.
 I am however having issues mounting the shared folder on Raspbian.
 I followed the instructions at https://www.gavingreer.com/2020/03/06/synology-nfs-mount but when I try to mount the drive, I don't get the expected results:
 $ sudo mount 192.168.178.69:/volume1/video /media/nas/video $ df -h | grep /media/nas/video/ $ ls /media/nas/video/ ls: cannot open directory '/media/nas/video/': Permission denied 
 Anyone any idea what I might be missing?

 The reason for encryption is that this is a vultr vps, not my hardware. If it was I wouldn't mind with radicale as a solution but as it isn't I would like if there is something if possible. If not will have to continue with radicale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey selfhosters, 
 I've recently had a problem with some apps that I'm selfhosting for our company being reported to google as phishing, including our website. This caused some issues last week as our website is listed in our signatures and Gmail flagged all our outgoing mails as phishing attempts.
 Additionally, one of the domains that has been reported is nothing more than a Bookstack wiki protected with Cloudflare Zero Trust, even if you get past Zero Trust, you'll still need to login to Bookstack. There's definitely no phishing or even anything to download there. I suspect we're being fake report bombed by someone for reasons unknown to me.
 It's causing some issues with my colleagues accessing the necessary tools we need to use if they happen to be using Chrome as their browser. Has anyone had experience with such a situation before? Apart from submitting an Incorrect Phishing Warning report, is there anything else I can do? I seriously doubt our servers have been compromised, I've looked at the logs and there's nothing that would hint at suspicious activity.
 Thanks in advance.

 I got some Intel FTLX8571D3BCV-IT SFP+ connectors for my 10gbs fiber homelab setup. I wasted a week trying to get them to work.
 Despite them being listed as 1gbs/10gbs compatible connector, they were never able to actually connect at 10gbs. ethtool even showed supported modes as 10000baseCR/Full and 10000baseSR/Full, but that's a load of BS.
 I compiled the intel ixgbe driver by hand and it still didn't help. Confirmed fiber cables and switch were known good by swapping out parts - it is definitely the FTLX8571D3BCV connectors being dumb.
 After checking online, seems this is a known issue. Want to spread the word here on reddit as well so that no one else gets bit by this buggy hardware.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All AWS storage products charge outrageous egress fees, to the extend that backing up to AWS doesn't seem feasible for me. It's like Hotel California: upload is free, storage cost is okay, but you want your data back? Payback!
 For example: s3 glacier us-east-1: $0.0036 per GB + $0.09 per GB egress (for first 10tb).
 https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/
 So if I backup 10 tb to aws and download it back at end of 1 year, it'll cost (0.0036 * 1024 * 10 * 12)+(0.09 * 1024 * 10)=442+921, i.e. 67% of my expense goes to egress. 
 I'm like...no f way. Until I saw something else they offered: workdoc! Apparently there's no charge on egress. I reread it trice but yeah. $5 per user with 1tb included. You can allocate more storage per user but that'll cost more than creating a second user, so just create 10 users. That works out to 5 * 10 * 12=$600, less than half of glacier, and you don't have to wait 12 hours. Oh and there's a web gui.
 https://aws.amazon.com/workdocs/pricing/
 Are they doing this to compete with gdrive? I cannot imagine they omitted egress charges by mistake.

 I could certainly try wiring the extra batteries up to the internal pack but it would likely be really ugly as I might have to drill a hole somewhere in the chassis or leave the front panel off.

 So, like the title says, I would be looking for a self-hostable solution to replace a box like HDHomeRun.
 Basically the idea would be to have a USB or PCIE card adapter to be able to use a TV antenna on my server and basically get the live TV channels it gets and then use them in Plex directly as a DVR exactly as I would with hdhomerun. 
 Currently, I am using xteve for iptv, but I'd like to be able to use a TV antenna, but I don't want to buy a proprietary box like the hdhomerun one.
 Is there a solution that exist out there that anyone knows of? And would it be viable compared to a premade solution? 
 Thanks in advance for any suggestion, and don't hesitate if I'm missing details.

 I have a sizable pile of 5TB, 4TB, 3TB and 2TB drives. I live somewhere where power is cheap and cooling is fresh air for 9 out of 12 months. I have JBODs and "IT" flashed controllers to run more than I have. All told, it's around .5 PB... someday, I'd like to break the PB barrier, but today is not that day.
 Can someone recommend a single software platform to support various disk sizes, reasonable (N+2) resillency and easy growth/failure replacement?
 UNRAID, too few disks. TrueNAS, would need a seperate pool for each disk size, replacement blows. I know next to nothing about OpenMediaVault but am going to fire that up here soon to poke about. I see people complaining about NFS speeds, but in general, I don't need this to be super fast.
 I run a plex server (I actually won't run that as a plugin, even if the platform supports it) that servers up and transcodes 4K HDR content, a few infrastructure VMs and some game servers, but outside of my plex server being a consumer of large disk, I don't have significant performance needs. My VMs I'll either run local or if I feel the need to go back to multiple VM hosts, I'll come up with something seperate from my bulk storage.
 Thanks for perusing my wall of text. Curious what other folks are using for large drive count systems. 
 I'll head off the "12TB refurbs are cheap" response with "there's nothing cheaper than what you already have."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently bought a R620, my first rack mount server purchase. It came with a 4-port Broadcom network card but I wanted to add some more ports just for fun and to experiment with Proxmox.
 It is an Intel 4-port PCI-E card I pulled from a Dell Optiplex 7040 desktop where it worked fine.
 When I boot the server it seems to initialize, it shows up in the system inventory, but not in the hardware network devices. When I plug a cable into it I get nothing.
 I tried digging around the Life Cycle Controller thinking maybe it had to be manually enabled but didn't see anything that jumped out at me. It is installed currently in PCI-E slot 1, but I have tried the others as well.
 Oddly, Proxmox sees the card (though I have not made use of it there, yet). Is there anything I need to do to get it to show up within the server itself (iDrac web interface, LCC, etc.) or is this just normal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So one of the things I'm doing in my lab is maintaining a practice and development environment for multiple languages and frameworks, such as Python, PHP, and even *shudders* Ruby, crossed with various Databases, such as PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, and other tools like rabbitmq, mqtt, and memcached and redis. So I'm thinking about expanding the database assortment into the 'commercial' realm of applications, so I'm looking at setting up an MS server with IIAS and .NET for web development, and databi for both OracleSQL and MSSQL. But licensing. Does anybody have any practical experience running these in the home lab? Do MS and Oracle make these available under home, lab, or student licenses for free or reduced cost? I couldn't even find a "Buy it now" purchase link on Oracle's website, and I'm trudging through their XE process now and finding that the generous '2GB in Memory' limit they place may not be as generous as I thought, since on a stock empty install it's already using over 1.5GB. So how do you license your MSSQL and OracleSQL in your home lab?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just moving my Unraid server across to new hardware based around an ASRock Z790 Pro RS MoBo (have flashed the latest stable BIOS). 
 I originally set up Unraid last month on an old/ repurposed Xeon based Thinkserver TS140.
 I moved the drives across (6TB Seagate, 8TB Seagate, 10TB WD, 18TB WD)
 Plus I'd been running the 2 x 20TB WDs unshucked as the parity drives via USB, so I shucked these and put them in the new case as I now have the PSU and drive bays to handle them.
 When I first turned the new PC on, only the Seagates were detected, both in BIOS & Unraid.
 So I tried taping pin 3 on the WD drives. The 10TB & 18TB are now being detected in BIOS & Unraid, but the 20TBs still aren't being detected.
 The Thinkserver was running in Legacy BIOS mode. The ASRock doesn't have a legacy option (that I can find), so is running as UEFI. Would that affect this?
 Any suggestions of something else I can try to get the 20TBs working?
 Are others using these drives with a recent UEFI only motherboard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sequence of events:
  
I have this hdd (TOSHIBA HDTB420EK3AA) and i want to use it to backup some internal drives on a desktop. I write a bash script to do this, i mess up, i corrupt the data, and i have to format it. 
 Trying to format this thing makes my pc freeze so badly i have to hard reset. I try the same with other machines, and different operating systmes, each one freezing aswell. The winner is an old laptop on lubuntu that manages to successfully format the drive in just over an hour. 
 I go back to the first desktop and modify the script, i run it and it kinda works. By looking at rsync output i notice that the average speed is 500 kb/s, reaching 40kb/s at some points. At some point it starts copying an .IPCH file that makes it reach 0 byte/s and then nothing. 
 I decide to exclude this file and other folders containing very large amount of small files, since it looks that the speed slows down especially in these cases. For what i know HDDs are ass in this type of operations but this is just ridiculous. 
 So i stop the rsync, and everything freezes again. I can't even open the file explorer. I boot windows and use diskpart this time, then i install DiskInfo.

 To me it looks very ok, but in the 20 minutes it took me to write this, diskpart managed to go from 0% to 2% in the process of formatting the disk. 
 The disk is almost factory new, but i can't send it back anymore. Any ideas?

 I commonly use sites like keep2share to download files and have been using mullvad to bypass data limitations. Some videos are broken into multiple parts and I often pull my phone out to download simultaneously.
 I was wondering if there was a more efficient way to do this from one device and if I could do something like linking different browser windows to different IP addresses. I am constantly downloading files and am perfectly fine with the time investment it may take to set something like this up.
 I thought of Jdownloader but I think that uses proxies versus a VPN correct? 
 Sorry for the newbie questions

 ​
 I am new here and posting as someone from TrueNAS forum suggested I ask for advice here.
 My plan was to use 3 WD 8 TB Red Plus HDD's with TrueNAS Scale. (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731377-REG/wd_wdbc9v0080hh1_wrsn_8tb_red_plus_cmr.html)
 The rest of the hardware is (an old gaming pc):
 msi x79a-gd45 plus (has 6 SATA Slots)
 i7-4930K
 250GB SSD
 16 GB RAM
 I could not get the HDD's to show up with that machine and I used TrueNAS Scale and Ubuntu on flash drive. I then tried attaching the HDD's one at a time to a WIN10 machine and still couldn't get them to show up. 
 The only way it would show up is in BIOS.
 Then I ordered an external HDD Hub that I plugged into the PC. It showed up and I ran some Linux commands from the TrueNAS Forum recommendations. 
 Please see …]]></summary>

 https://imgur.com/a/1Fp9nfm
 From what I can see there's 4 hookups for the front backplane, and 8 on the rear with only 4 hooked up. With 4 free ports. And only 4 cables to plug into a raid card.
 From what I can tell it looks like two of the front backplane cables goes to the rear backplane, with only two from each free to plug into a raid card.
 I'm coming from a r710 so I'm still a bit of a newbie here. So just want to know if it's all good. I need to get new cables anyhow, as my gear is 8087. So I'll need to buy new cables. Just need to see if I need 4, 8, 12, or what's up.
 Thanks for any and all help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been doing back and forth on whether or not I should move away from my current NAS solution that is simply just 2x external HDDs connected to a Lenovo SFF (m710q). It is plenty powerful for my few tasks, but I am not super stoked about having to use external drives, since there is obviously no room for internal upgrades. I only need two drives, as I don't need a whole ton of capacity, but like having the failsafe in case of a drive failure. Currently, I am just using robocopy script to copy any changes made on one drive to the other via a scheduled task but have been tinkering with TrueNAS as a more professional solution with less overhead than windows.
 So, my question: is there any inherent downside to using external HDD enclosures and 2.5in drives in a NAS? Obviously, they are slightly more expensive, but less expensive than building a new machine to do the same tasks...

 One year after getting into selfhosting
 I just wanted to share my path to selfhosting so far!My first intention was to host a secure passwordmanager for myself and my family (Vaultwarden).Well I got kind of addicted to selfhosting services and replace comercial services like Google Photos, OneDrive and PasteBin.
 So I want to share my current setup, consisting of some VPS's and home equipment.I'll go through everything I am running on each machine.Maybe I can inspire some of you and if you have questions, just ask away!
 I almost exclusively use Docker / Docker Compose and LXC containers to host services.

 Obviously there are repos like Bitnami, but they're more component services (mysql, rabbitmq, postgres, etc) vs applications.

 When Fal2Ban kicks in, it bans the Cloudflare IPS and therefor, I am still able to authenticate from my TEST IPs....
 Anyone know why this is happening? I am assuming in my reverse proxy I need *something* so that it passes the real IP through, yes? I have tried various settings in the Synology GUI to no avail..
 I am using a special cloudflare.conf file in Fail2Ban to pass it the data it needs to automatically put in the bans...which works, but it ends up banning IPS belonging to Cloudflare... Any guidance appreciated. In Vaultwarden.log it is seeing cloudflare's IP and not the true IPS.

The setup - 9 machines in two areas of the house that I would like to be able to manage from a single chair, USB keyboard and mouse, 1920x1200 monitor.
 
Machines have disparate video connections, so I know I will need adapters from HDMI/DP/VGA to whatever the KVM is using. 
 
I know I should be using IPMI when possible, but only 3 of the 9 machines have this capability.
 
I understand I can run a remotely switchable KVM into a PiKVM or TinyKVM as an option, and I am looking into that as well, but not really seeing cost savings here with a KVM for each room plus the box.
 
I would like to do IP KVM rather than RDP or other remote access, as I would like to be able to deal with everything from the BIOS up, and also …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I figured I'd ask here since a few of you are using Dashy. 
 I've only found 1 issue on the GitHub describing this issue and there's not a lot of traction on it. 
 I am resetting up Dashy on a new server (dockerized) and found that I can't get multiple pages working. When adding a secondary page and clicking it, the dashboard breaks. The best way to describe it is the theme breaks and the new page doesn't load. 
 I've tried using the sample pages from the Dashy docs in case my yml was broken, but I experience the same issue. 
 In the docker compose, I've declared my /opt/dashy/public dir and also the specific config files and nada. 
  volumes: - /opt/dashy/public/mainpage.yml:/app/public/conf.yml - /opt/dashy/public/testpage.yml:/app/public/testpage.yml - /opt/dashy/item-icons:/app/public/item-icons 
 On the original server, it works great. Second and third pages load, but on this new instance, it's broken. 
 Both instances are on the same version (2.1.1)
 Just not sure why multiple pages started giving me such an issue and was wondering if others were having the same issue.

The 710 and 720 boot right into the bios. The 730, on the other hand, boots into a password protected bios. I have tried resetting the cmos and jumping the pins. And none of the instructions on the Google are working either. Does anybody have any ideas. I figure I'm just going to have to replace the motherboard.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel like I'll know what the unfortunate answer is, but the million dollar question is has anyone found a fast way to calculate the hamming distance between a very very very large set of hashes?
 I have a dataset (that will continue to grow) that I'm planning on granting limited access to the public via way of allowing the user upload an item, then the server checks against the database of hashes, and shows information from similar hashes. The issue is that the database of hashes will be over 500 hundred million.
 From my understanding of finding similar/identical content, hamming distance is the fastest approach in calculating the difference between items? The issue I am seeing is that this must be calculated for each query? So the server is checking the 500 hundred million images each and every time someone wants to check?
 Is there any way to speed this process that I'm not seeing in my research? How do things like deduplication software, or reverse/similiar image searches work so fast? What's their secret? Just more compute and they're harnessing a shit ton of compute for each query? TinEye claims to be able to "search a 57.6 billion web image index in real-time." but how?? This must be the KFC's secret herbs and spices or the Coke recipe and I'm just shit out of luck?

 I want to do a small stock of stuff I buy regularly for my home. To be able to never forget what to buy every week, I want to generate a dynamic list every X days. 
 I am looking for a inventory management solution. Usage: home / personal 
 Requirements : - home inventory management - manage available products with price, quantity and details (such as consumption time, that means in how many days is each product consumed) - manage list of recursive stuff to buy - access to an overview of the quantity of the products that I have in my stock and when I will have to renew them. - set notifications (emails or push) to notify me when a product inventory is lower than a certain quantity - creates automatically s list of products I need to rebuy every fix time (ex. Every week). - responsive design -self hosted
 I know that a lot of solutions exist for inventory management, but I can't try them all and I am sure that some of you have some propositions.
 Thank you for your help.

I have loads of stuff that I've collected through the years in several HDDs and SSDs, maybe a dozen or more in total. I was considering getting a NAS so that I can lower the risk of losing anything and also make everything accessible to me easily. 
 What I'm most concerned about is availability/reliability. AWS guarantees 99,999999999%. That's not something you can get at home. There are so many ways to just mess up. The cost to scale is also very linear for AWS, compared to a home system.
 I have unlimited Internet already.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on trying to solidify my backup strategy. I do think it's fairly solid, but there are a couple things I know that I can do better. 
 Current strategy: Centralized storage via Synology NAS (1621+ w/ 32GB ECC RAM) with btrfs. NAS snapshots hourly and maintains snapshot through typical pruning measures. NAS backs up to connected Seagate Backup 8TB drive and Backblaze B2 via Hyper Backup. NUC11 running Windows with read-only user connects to shares and backs up to connected external hard drive via Arq 7. Have rotational cold-storage via Arq as well. 
 A couple things I'd like to fix: 
  
NUC11 running Windows (will likely convert to Hypervisor of some sort, even if just HyperV), was part of a project.
 Potentially move the external drive hanging off of the NUC to an internal 2.5 HDD.
 Add a backup tool that is open source, even if it's just a cold backup. 
 Potentially remove NUC11 in general, as I'm running less on it and have a beefy desktop, and far fewer full-time running services than I did. Would move the service or two to run off of the NAS. Though, this would mean trying to incorporate my desktop into initiating a backup process of some sort, potentially manually, which makes it less desirable.
  
The amount of data that I would consider critical is very low, somewhere in between 200-300GB
 Any suggestions on how I could make this more solid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I ended up setting up a cloudflare tunnel. Previously I had been utilizing nginx proxy manager and exposed ports 80 & 443 to the internet. It was working fine, but after reading about cloudflares tunnel I determined why continue to expose ports to the internet.
 Tunnel works great, I can go to ha.mydoman.com and it brings me to home assisstant. Did the same thing with jellyfin. Then I realized when using the domain name internally it was being treated as if I was connecting externally and forcing jellyfin to transcode the videos when on my local network. This makes sense since the dns is now being routed to cloudflare back home. Previously with nginx i used hairpin nat to keep all traffic local.
 I setup dns override in unbound to point to the IP address of NGINX (using Opnsense firewall). I flushed my dns and when I ping that domain it shows the IP. In NGINX I still have setup to use the host ha.mydomain.com . 
 ​
 However, when on my internal network when I go to ha.mydomain.com I get a connection refused. So I suspect the domain or something isn't properly getting passed to nginx? Therefore it can't resolve properly. When I do ha.mydomain.com:8989/sonarr I can get to sonarr (it requires the port to be specified - otherwise connection refused) via NGINX so something odd is going on. What is the best place to look? Bit stumped at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have needed a UPSS for a while but I keep putting it off due to cost, features, lifespan, support, etc. but maybe you can recommend something that meets the criteria I have? 
 Features required to make it "the one for me":
  
Network interface for SNMP/alerts/monitoring/etc.
 Battery replacement for when the day comes
 1 or 2U rack mountable
  
Power requirements (what will it run during a power outage):
  
1 PA-440 firewall
 1 Unifi 48 port POE switch
 1 Arris SB6190 modem (do not care if this gracefully shuts down but needed for any alerts)
 2 ESX servers running on old low power Dell OptiPlex hardware
 1 NAS server also running on old low power OptiPlex hardware
  
A huge concern I have is that power will go out in the middle of the night so it would be nice to have the UPS be smart enough to trigger some sort of API calls or scripted shutdowns but at the very least send some sort of alert to my phone to wake me up for manual shut downs. If the hardware itself sounds an alarm there is no way I will hear it from 3 floors up while sleeping. Am I just dreaming a perfect UPS or does something exist that can do "all the things"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a NAS for backup, media server, VMs, etc. It's only serving myself, so I don't like the idea of spinning 6+ spinning up drives up/down when I occasionally need to access a few media files daily when when I reboot for maintenance, testing, or just don't use it for maybe weeks at a time max.
 As I understand, SSDs rarely fail aside from reaching write limit, which is something measurable (and even then, I've heard of people having Samsung SSDs that are nearly twice the TBW that's in the spec). I don't plan on running RAID, since downtime and access to massive amount of data isn't important to me--instead, I prefer frequent incremental backups, occasional full backups, as well as longer life of drives and lower power consumption.
 I will only ever deal with 8-16TB worth of data I want online at the moment, rest is cold storage (combined total of ~100TB hard limit for the foreseeable, I only have 60TB data total). I prefer high TBW because performance is not important for me and backing up constant flow of new large media files is.
 Assuming high TBW SSDs are suitable for such a use case, what high TBW SSDs do you recommend? I was initially looking at Samsung SSDs because they are the gold standard in general, but I've come across Intel DC S3610 as a recommendation that is spec'd ~5x TBW more (10.7PB). I'm not normally one to look for used storage but people seem to have success with used ones from Ebay that are probably pulled from servers after their intended service and they usually a reasonable amount of remaining life at a great price. Unless these somehow fail in other ways, I don't see how they aren't very popular. This model is 7 years old though, so I'm thinking there might be better options (not necessarily price/TB).
 Any thoughts and suggestions are much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I recently got an old Toshiba T1000LE from a relative. Unfortunately I opened it up and there are a lot of bad caps and corrosion on the main board, but the hard disk seems fine (model is JVC JDE2825P30-7, a standard 2.5" IDE) so I removed it from the machine to recover the files.
 Problem is my w10 computer can't seem to recognize or read anything from this drive. Assuming it's still working (it powers on and spins up) is there a way to recover files on it? Or to make it readable?
 I usually do this procedure for machines that mount more recent os (from w95 on) so I'm not really practical with hard drives this old. Original computer mounts MS-DOS 3.3, it's from 1990, the HDD is 20 mb.
 Thanks a lot in advance!!

I also scan documents with my cell phone (Android Genius Scan) and here the scan is now and then not scanable with OCR ( text is like "t e x t" instead of "text" and so not searchable). So rework is necessary. Now it would be good if paperless would automatically tag all scans from Genius Scan. Only I can only specify the filename when scanning, but paperless doesn't seem to search it. Do you guys know a solution? Thanks.

 Free and open source, but the most unpolished. You may spend lots of time trying to get certain things to work and fail in the end. 
 As far as I can tell, it's a "simpler and possibly slightly more user-friendly" version of Mautic. 
 Some things are better than Sendy, others worse. Overall I prefer Listmonk, especially since it's free and open source.

Nextcloud ( using linuxserver.io image ) doesn't work (despite connecting to the database and creating table) but I think it's due to my configuration so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
 Coder use some PostgreSQL specific function not implemented in CockroachDB
 Wakapi doesn't work for the migration ( an issue is opened if you want to take a look) 
  
I may be out of luck and I will revert back to a simple PostgreSQL container but does any of you use CockroachDB for his selfhosted environnement or have an alternative more compatible ?

 Any suggestions what would be the best for this? I was looking at Intel NUCs but decieded to ask here if you have any better ideas.
 Also it would have to be pretty quiet, since I live in the apartment where the living room and bedroom are the same room 😅

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a self-hostable service that I can send live video to (with OBS for example) that has seamless pause and rewind. By this I mean very specifically, I want to be able to watch the live stream in real time and be able to pause or rewind the live stream and be able to go back to real-time. I use a browser extension called Video Speed Controller, and with this if I ever need to pause or rewind a stream I can increase playback speed and slowly work my way back to real-time. Hopefully that makes sense.
 My use for this would be to capture live Twitch streams with streamlink, then re-stream it via OBS to this self-hosted stream so that I can pause and rewind, because Twitch's player does not offer these very basic features. Currently I can achieve exactly the functionality I desire with YouTube's live streaming service, but I feel kinda icky about broadcasting someone else's Twitch live stream onto my own YouTube, even if it is a private/unlisted stream intended exclusively for my own use.
 It would also be ideal if it works with a reverse proxy so that I can use it away from home securely.
 I've briefly looked into Owncast but it does not appear to have the DVR functionality. I haven't set up an Owncast server yet to actually investigate, but I figure if it doesn't advertise that feature then it's unlikely to have it.
 Does anyone know of anything like this? Thank you.

I'm aware Apple's Content Caching feature is meant to do exactly this, but does it have version limitations? As in, can a system running macOS Catalina 10.15.7 store and host updates for macOS 11/12/13? What about for older versions, like 10.11 or 10.13? Does the server OS losing security update support mean it won't be able to fetch updates for peer machines on newer OSes either? Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Alright guys, get your xkcds ready! I programmed yet another monitoring and alarming tool because I couldn't find one I like for the use case I'm targeting. It's pretty basic right now as it only has two types of checks (filesystem and memory usage) and a bunch of actions (e-mail, log, process and webhook). As the (not very creative) name suggests, it's quite minimal in terms of configuration and code. It's also super easy to extend (which I will do; see the roadmap). It's only for Linux (for now..).
 Feedback and contributions are very welcome!

 Bit of a background on me: I hate subscription services. Whether I am paying monthly to watch movies/ tv shows, listen to music, play video games, or even just store data on someone else's computer ("cloud"), I hate it. At this point, I would rather spend exponentially more than I ever would for the subscriptions if it means I get to build/own it. Having said that, I don't really have a specific budget in mind, but I am okay with this being a costly venture that takes a couple of years to perfect.

 ​
 Up until now I controlled those servers over windows RDP however now that I have these new screens I want to have finer control over the resolution so I can scale it by clicking and dragging the corner like I would any other window. I tried NoMachine but for some reason that I can't figure out, NoMachine is bugging out on my win server 2019 system (the main server) greying out the "share screen" option. I don't need external access I just want something that is locally hosted and is better than the garbage built-in RDP (and free)
 ​
 Any suggestions. Thanks

Then I turned off my pc, when I went to turn it on again it won't boot. It will keep having a black screen and as soon as I disconnect the data cable from my new HDD it will boot.
 I tried many times and I really don't understand what happened. I tried searching online but can't find a fix to my problem.
 Any idea ? 
 P.s. I can see it in the bios Edit: I did boot my pc and then connected the sata to the HDD, it took a while but then it showed in disk manager as RAW. I still can't access it and anything I try to do to it takes forever and never gets done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want a robust set-up for exactly three things:
 - Backing up my computer and lap-top. Right now, I use Acronis to back them both up to the same external hard drive and to the Acronis cloud.
 - Backing up very large (hundreds of GBs, into TBs) of .csv data. These are very large health-care database sets that I use professionally. Right now, I store them on an external hard drive (separate from the computer back-up one) and on Google Cloud Storage.
 - I would like to start a personal PLEX media server.
 I am new to home networking and data-hoarding but my ideal set-up would include some of the following features:
 - As much automation as possible. I have a desktop (hard-wired to network) and a laptop (WiFi). Ideally, my desktop backups will occur on a regularly scheduled basis and my laptop whenever on my home network and/or docked at home.
 - Robust to failure; I think I want on-site, off-site, and remote (cloud) back-ups.
 - The ability to access my storage remotely (i.e., access my PLEX server while traveling for work, etc.).
 I'm prepared to read a lot and make purchases and effort as necessary, I just can't figure out where to start, the sheer amount of information and terms are overwhelming.

So far nearly everything I have laying around shows a "fault detected on drive" error - even on new drives. The only ones I've found so far that work are teamgroup vulcan g (not z).
 Anyone know of any others that work? Would I have better luck with a different raid controller?
 Edit: Updating to solved. Looks like samsung evo ssds are the way to go - and an update to the h710 or h710p to improve performance. Thanks for the help guys!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a case that will hold at least 6 3.5" drives while simultaneously holding a full gaming PC build. I won't be using liquid cooling so no need of a radiator. I don't want to do a separate build due to power consumption and physical space limitations. I'm the only one that uses the server so I don't need a separate NAS.
 I've been looking at the Fractal Design Define 7 XL but I'm not sure I like the price and the size. I don't really need 18 drives so I could do fine with something smaller but middle-ground options seem to be somewhat limited.
 I would also prefer light tempered glass to dark if possible and I definitely want a side window.
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: need help deciding on how to upgrade my system. 1: utilize JBOD W/ UnRaid 2: new server system (specs at bottom)
 Hey guys, I have been hoarding on a system I build last year which is utilizing Linux mint as the OS. It has served me well but I’m running out of space (seems like a common issue here) and only have enough sata connections and power for 2 more drives in the current case and configuration. When I set everything up I basically had no clue what I was doing and everything is all over the place and hard to find/archive my data. After about a year of researching what my needs/wants are I’m wanting to switch to running UnRaid on my system which would mean a complete wipe of everything as far as I understand. I am contemplating buying a second computer and setting everything up and then migrating over to it with the old system used as a back up for my important files. I found a local built NAS for sale for $400 (specs below) or can I utilize Unraid on a small HP computer and add drive via a usb JBOD?
 Processor: AMD FX 4300
 Motherboard: ASUS M6A97 (Supports DDR3 ECC memory)
 RAM: 16 GB (4X4GB) DDR3 ECC 1333Mhz
 Video Card: Nvidia Quadro 510S
 Dell PERC 710 RAID Card (Supports RAID 0,1,5,6,10,50)
 Hard Drives: 2x Samsung 860 EVO 500GB, 6x HGST 4TB HDD, and 1x Western Digital 6TB HDD.

I've been wanting to share an external Drive I have (Drobo) connected to my windows machine with the linux side. Just a few folders to be able to read/write/ and execute from both OS's and the regular user. 
 Here's the rub and mind you I'm still learning linux and getting these services running is just part of my learning process.
 I've been running:
 "sudo mount.cifs //ip/Downloads /home/user/Downloads -o user=username"
 to share a Downloads folder on my Drobo with the one I specify on linux but everytime I run it, though it does allow me to read the content I cannot write. Despite attempting to chmod permissions it will only write for the root user. I've attempted to change to permissions at the root level and still keep running into a road block. I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing here but figured I'd throw it out to the the ether and see if I got some kind of idea.

 Thanks!

 just wanted to ask around a little bit regarding regular home use drives that are currently available.
 I was looking to expand my regular PC storage with something like a 2TB drive. Then I noticed that my current 5y/o WD Blue 1TB did accumulate some bad sectors and image backup failed due to some read errors.So it was time to get a new drive not just to expand but to replace that drive. The use of this drive being as a secondary drive for installing programs and stuff that doesn't need SSD levels of speed, but certainly not just storing data long term.
 Looking into what drives are currently available I quickly came upon the SMR vs CMR debacle and noticed that all WD Blue drives above 1TB use SMR (same for larger seagate barracudas). I did some research on that and really heard so…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi reddit fam,
 ​
 I have a question that I could use some advice. I have a 4 bay Synology Nas with 32TB configured with RAID 5 I think, with 1 drive parity so I have 24TB of usable storage. I have over 20tb backed up to BackBlaze with retention of 14 days. I am paying like $140 a month right now. I also got a T-Mobile promotion which gives me 2TB + Unlimited Google Photos for $15 a month and since I use the 2TB for work, I thought it was a no brainer.
 ​
 I am wanting to change my offsite backup storage. I am thinking of purchasing another 4 bay NAS or building a cheap one, storing at my parent's business, which is a motel, and using that as a backup target over paying for BackBlaze. I was thinking of making it a bit beefier and having more storage so they can store their surveillance footage on the NAS locally and I can use it as a backup target. Curious on pros/cons of getting rid of BackBlaze and taking care of my own offsite backup.
 ​
 I have 2Gig up/down at my home, and my parents business has a 400/40 mbps internet connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I set up a USB TTL connection to the serial port on some Seagate hard drives and managed to 'repair' some that had bad sectors (G-list entries) by issuing a low level format command that tested every sector. 
 This process took twice as long as a normal erase or format and any sectors that were deemed unsatisfactory were placed into the 'resident G-list' (which is similar to the factory defect list aka P-list in that the sectors are skipped over rather than reassigned so there is no performance loss).
 One drive had only a handful of bad sectors while the other had a few thousand. I am wondering if these 'refurbished' drives are now 'good as new' or should still be sent to recycling.
 More info on Seagate terminal commands here. warning issuing the wrong command or making a typo could lead to data loss so do not connect to the serial port of a drive containing important data
 Note: this only works on older drives that do not have the serial port locked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[HI all, I'm trying to figure out how to get PVE to stay updated while hosting my router. I've got pfSense running as my main home firewall, virtualized in Proxmox, running on one of those Topton N5015 4-interface boxes. NICs are used as follows:
  
WAN (PCI passthrough, to cable modem)
 LAN (PCI passthrough, pfSense at 192.168.1.1)
 (unused)
 Proxmox management (192.160.0.100)
  
The interaction with Proxmox here is kind of clunky. I don't have a management network or anything, so if I want to log into the PVE on this one, I have to go down into the basement where this thing lives, and directly plug in an a cable, and set a static IP and finally connect. That's clunky but workable. The real issue is that PVE can't see the internet, and therefore can't get updates or anything. And if I want to run other services on PVE here, they don't run on my LAN network, and they can't see the internet either.
 The real issue to solve is getting updates for PVE. Any tips on how to do that? It seems like I could use NIC 3 to connect into the LAN - and connect to the internet in a sort of Inception-style labyrinth. Is that wise or even possible? Is there some way to update PVE offline with a usb stick or something?
 (I suppose one solution is to ditch proxmox and run pfSense bare metal. I liked the idea of being able to snapshot my firewall in case anything goes wrong, and the little Topton unit is almost overpowered to just run as a firewall, so I figured it would be nice to use any extra power for other services. But I am open to running bare metal if it makes more sense.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. It's been a while since I've used Glacier, the last time it being such a pain I deleted my account just to get rid of it. It seems its usability has improved with its rework into S3 Glacier Deep Archive and when I just compared the pricing to the Synology C2 service I've been using for years to take care of my few TB of media, it's 8x cheaper! Not considering the hefty but rare to incur retrieval costs, of course.
 So far everything has been going swimmingly, my Synology NAS just configured to use the Glacier Backup app (first time I use it, so far used only Hyper Backup to Syno C2) service with a small test folder into my new AWS account. I know enough to be suspicious of Glacier, so I'd love you people's advice on a few points...
 VERSION CONTROL:
 If I have to full restore from backup, I want to restore to the last daily state I backed up, not every file I've ever had, so I've disabled the following:
 https://preview.redd.it/doxpu31g4i6a1.jpg?width=816&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3866059ae4ec6409c40c957d9fefa569f4d9b490
 Is VC something I'd be giving up, with only the last point to restore from unless I choose to never delete from Glacier locally deleted files? That would be a fatally flawed concept for retrieving accidentally deleted files!
 Currently I benefit from version controlled backups in C2, with deduplication making it possible to not pay insane amounts for that.
 MOVING FILES = DUPLICATION?
 When I move a folder around my NAS, does that schedule it for deletion in Glacier then recreate it next time a backup kicks off? If so, it could prove very pricy with Glacier's "pay 3 months minimum" storage model...
 Thanks in advance, I appreciate partial answers too, as well as advice about other Gotchas I may not have thought of!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm probably missing something, but I'd like:
  
use tailscale as my "VPN" into my network
 use simple hosts like bitwarden.home.mydomain.com to access resources
 protect my bitwarden_rs instance with https (hopefully be able to use the native apps instead of the website)
 make it simple to manage (no self-hosted certs installed on end devices)
 not expose my proxy to the public web (egress is fine)
 and do it for free (other than the purchase of the domain)
  
My thought was to create a DNS record in CF that points to a reserved IP, "10.5.5.14". Then on "10.5.5.14", setup a reverse proxy entry with the cert provided by CF.
 I'm guessing this isn't possible as the edge certs can only be used if you proxy requests through CF network, which isn't possible because I'm within a reserved IP range.
 Is there another way to achieve what I want to do?

 I know the HW is kinda old but wondering if anyone else here have gone through the same thing and can confirm the cpu is a drop in replacement. 
 Thanks!

 If i have Adguard runnning on port 80 , i need this port to have my DNS working on Adguard, but i want that my dashboard to run also on this port, like i want to just type myaddress.com or 192.168.1.20 to display my dashboard without my dns not working. 
 How can i do that ? I tried reading some documentation but i couldn't understand.
 I know you can use ngninx port forwarding, but will my dns work if 80 is not the port for my dns ?

 To be more precise. I have NordVPN and want the Chromecast on my network to have its traffic go via NordVPN.
 The chromecast doesn’t support VPN settings as far as I know. My router (TP Link ER605) supports policy routing and VPN. But not NordVPN. 
 Is there a way to have a very simple virtual router that supports NordVPN ? Preferably as a docker container. 
 My idea would be to create a second wireless network on my ubiquity AP with this virtual router as a gateway. Not sure if it would work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've been using Plex for a very long time. Starting with my PC as the server, then moved to a hosted VPS, and currently I'm using a Seedbox.
 The Seedbox is extremely powerful and meets all my needs, but it's getting fairly expensive upgrading storage to a higher capacity.
 I would like your opinions about self hosted solutions. I'm open to using Nas devices, or even building another PC to support it. I currently have an nVidia 1080 that I can utilize for that purpose. The only thing I need, is a solution / device that would do the transcoding on its own, because I don't want to use my PC for that. 
 I'm currently serving about 4 users and max simultaneously transcoding is 2-3. Also serving 4k content so I need a device that's powerful enough.
 I'm also looking for the cheapest solution that can be used for this purpose.
 Greatly appriciate your input!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Hoarders,
 Recently I've purchased two HP Ultrium 920 tape drives with a single IBM lto-3 ultrium tape. One of those drives accepted my LTO tape, but got fried shortly afterwards (remember kids, modular power supplies can have mirrored 12V-5V if you're not using original cabling~ ) The second one powers up fine, but rejects the tape, basically, ejects it few seconds after inserting it and flashes the "Tape" LED.
 I'm thinking that aside from worn out drive it might be the cause of old firmware. I was wondering if anybody has that firmware. HP has the download blocked behind extended support.
 ​
 HP Library and Tape Tools sees the drive as below:
  
Product ID : Ultrium 1-SCSI [HH] 
 Drive Technology : LTO 
 Mech. Serial Number : HU10927KPF 
 Firmware Rev : P61D/Standalone 
 Target ID : 3 
 Target LUN : 0 
 OBDR Capability : Supported 
 WORM Capability : Not Supported 
 Firmware : P61D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi to everyone,
 I'm really new here and very newbie at this topic. But I've been reading a lot since some time ago.
 I want to host some services at home, but I really don't know how to match all my ideas.
 First, I'm going to change my router's ISP Provider. I think I'm going to buy a Netgear x4s R7800 and to install OpenWRT on it. I was about to buy a a Turris Omnia for 170€, but it was out of my price range. And I can get the Netgear for just 60€.
 Second, I have a Qnap TS-431P2 with 8GB and 2x10TB HDD. But I'd like to sell it because I'd like to install another OS, like Debian.
 I'd like to have these services at home, only for LAN accessing:
 - OpenMediaVault? I have thousands of photos, and we'd like to backup my photos from our android and laptop devices.
 - Nextcloud.
 - Suricata to monitor all my network.
 - Some application to see the all the photos.
 - Pi-hole.
 Then, I've thought to get a device like a mini-pc to handle all of that. Install a linux on it, and create all that services as containers. Is it possible to do it like that? First I thought to buy a Rpi 4 8GB, but I've seen a Fujitsu Q920, which I think is better, and I can get one second handly even cheaper than a Rpi. Any other better HW solution?
 Please, any comments, advices or links would be really appreciated.
 Thank you in advance.

It went back to looking at how the dashboard did months ago before the alleged storage limit was put in place. I'm on the Enterprise Plus plan.
 I'm a single-user organization.
 Can anyone else verify that the limit language is gone for them (Enterprise Standard and Enterprise Plus only)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty burned out after the whole cyberpower fiasco, thank god for costco's 1 year return policy at least.
 I don't think i'll be able to go without a UPS again, the power lines entering my neighborhood will fall if you look at them funny and it's been useful more than a dozen times this year and it saved me from quite an extreme brownout we had a few months ago. I've been looking around online and here's what I've been looking for.
 - ~1500VA
 - 900+W
 - Pure Sinewave 
 I've heard quite a lot of good things about Eaton and thus i've been looking at the Eaton 5SC1500 recently, however the only thing holding me back is all the reviews and mentions online about the fan noise. 
 Specs are listing 40dB at 1m, that's insane. I have my UPS under my desk and I sleep in the same room, from what I've heard the fan runs 24/7 and not just when the inverter is running, I wouldn't have a problem with that if it weren't so loud though. 
 I've heard about some people replacing the fan with a noctuca fan but I'm not sure if i'm comfortable with this, a lot of the posts mentioning this don't specifically mention which model they're working on so I'd rather not just go out and replace the fan off a vague guide. 
 It's really a bummer given that everything else about the UPS sounds perfect and is as close as it gets to the cp1500pfclcd.
 Does anyone have any ideas? Either towards the eaton unit or some other recommendations, I'm quite busy day to day and in my spare time i've been trying to look around for something that doesn't break the bank (<$500) but my attempts seem to be futile and it's getting really tiring.

Everything has been running well, but given that I've been throwing 150 gig archives to it constantly, I decided it was time to upgrade from the base nic to one with 10GbE capabilities in a direct attach/peer to peer config with my main desktop. The x540 with 2 RJ45 10GbE and 2 1GbE ports installed nicely and has connected to my 1GbE network albeit limited to the slower speeds.
 My current issue is getting my desktop to connect to the R720. Turns out the card I purchased is an x540 Convergence Network Adapter. After installing the drivers from Intel, I'm not getting any network activity when plugged into the R720 nor when plugged into the switch (I've tried a crossover cable and a patch cable). 
 Am I missing anything or do I need to find another NIC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been offered a security position as a promotion from my current “help desk masquerading as Jr sys admin” role that I’ve had. So many of the interview questions weren’t things I encountered in my day to day work life, but are things I’m at least beginning to understand thanks to my homelab and self-hosted projects!
 That’s all I came to say. To everyone else that’s plugging away in their homelabs, never discount the value the knowledge you’re accumulating. 
 I’m trying to figure out what my reward should be once this change makes its way to my paychecks… expand the capabilities of my proxmox cluster with another node, with more ram for an existing node, of by getting myself a legacy Unix workstation (Sun or SGI)…. I know what will pay off in the long term; it’s just not nearly as fun sounding compared to other idea, which will be self gratifying but completely useless :)

 To save rack space, I was considering either virtualizing TrueNAS or using possibly Windows Server Storage Spaces and direct attaching it to the R720 instead. Has anyone have experience with a TrueNAS virtualized and using a disk shelf?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to share 2x 4tb NAS type hard disks for all my home computers. Right now due to limitations I'm not able to put together a NAS type of PC, but maybe in the future I will properly set it up. So the idea is to use them in my main desktop computer using samba share.
 I will store important data (precious personal stuff) and movies, so my main concern is to reduce the possibility of corruption or loss of data. I don't care too much for the speed of the share. What is the most robust configuration for this?
 I firstly thought to use them as RAID1, but as I'm reading more forums, the more I get the idea that maybe it's overkill. Maybe it's better to make a backup once a week for example and leave the possible problems of RAID missconfigurations? I'm a newbie for RAID configs.
 The other thing is the hard disk file system. Right now I'm between ZFS and EXT4. Same as before, I heard that there is not much difference between them for my size and tasks, but any little improvement over data integrity is appreciated.
 Just in case it's important, my PC has 16gb ram ddr4 and it has a mid modern cpu.

I'm still struggling with Authentic LDAP, but I have OIDC and plex authentication working, so I feel well on my way there.
 Now I want to add crowdsec to secure NPM..... I got crowdsec up and running, but once I ingested the NPM logs, I found out that NPM sees all traffic originating from 127.24.0.1.
 I tried setting up macvlan and when I put NPM on there I could hit the management interface on its new IP from my PC, but my router couldn't see it to set the port forwards, so I revered to the bridge network.
 I've seen several guides saying this can be achieved by setting real IP headers in nginx.conf, but NPM doesn't have (at least mine doesn't) that file. ./data/nginx/default_host/site.conf is the closest thing I can find in my set-up following the official NPM install docs.
 Any pointers on how to log real IPs in a docker NPM would be greatly appreciated. 
 Or if anyone knows a better way to set up crowdsec on synology, I'd love to hear those suggestions as well.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have experiences with or thoughts on SATA power switches like these (not necessarily that brand)--are they simple and foolproof or considered hacky and not worthy of risking your disks on? I would assume SATA is conducive to this if hotswapping is a thing that can be supported.
 I have external drives for cold storage littered on my workspace and I want to chuck them in my server (Node 304 case). Unfortunately, the USB-SATA logic board on the WD Reds from the Easystores don't fit into the mounting system of the case, hence I'm wondering if the SATA power switch allows me to turn on the drives every few months or so for the occasional access.
 Alternatively I'm thinking of something like this USB-SATA adapter (https://www.amazon.com/Indicators-External-Converter-Computer-Transfer/dp/B017CO5FJM/) (not necessarily this particular brand) and hook up the AC adapter to a power strip with switches for individual outlets to turn the drives on/off. This seems to be the same as the builtin logic boards in functionality but should be drive brand agnostic (e.g. WD logic boards may not necessarily be compatible with Seagate drives, at least without some mods). It is messier and uses USB3, but I should still be able to wire the cables through the PCIe slot and plug in the AC adapters to a power strip with a toggle on/off feature.
 Slight concern is drives not receiving stable power and potentially inducing more wear and tear as a result. 
 I should note I am not interested in spinning down the drives--the drives will be used for months at a time and I will be rebooting the system probably biweekly for maintenance and testing, which will inevitably spin up the disks on startup only for them to be spun down again.
 If neither options are suitable then I suppose I just have to live with the drives on top of the server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now when I am keeping media on two separate backups I just run a a rsync script I created for doing a checksum comparison. Are there any tools out there specifically for validating backups? Say you have three stores, at least two of them should have the same checksum for a vmware image. All three should be the same but if one is off the other two match, then I'd have the script refresh it from one of the other two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I last posted here ~5 months ago about Fireshare, a project that I have been working on to quickly and easily share my game clips via unique links. 
 It got a lot of positive feedback so I thought I would share it again since I've seen a number of people in comments and post since then asking about video sharing solutions. 
 Core Features
  
Share h264 encoded mp4, mov and webm files via unique links
 Set videos as either public vs private. Public videos can be seen by anyone who visits your Fireshare instance. Private videos can only be seen by those with the unique link.
 Public and private upload capabilities.
 Simple setup requires basic knowledge of Docker.
  
You can see it for yourself on my demo site: https://v.fireshare.net 
 The github project: https://github.com/ShaneIsrael/fireshare
 I also have a complete tutorial on self hosting it which you can find here
 You can find other well put together tutorials on setting it up on YouTube and other websites that users have put together as well.
  
Let me know if you have questions and/or if you've used it I would love to hear your feedback. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have a macbook, PC, synology NAS, iPhone, some laptops and some raspberry pis.
 I work outside my house quite a lot from my windows laptop or run simple tasks using termius on my iphone. My macbook is always on at home so I usually ssh into it and do my work, sometimes my iphone as well.
 There are some things I cannot do with this, for example if I want to turn on my nas remotely, I can't use my iphone as the app requires you to be on the same network. Also I don't feel safe that I have exposed my devices to the internet like that.
 I want to connect all my devices onto the same network so I can access them anywhere as if they were on the same LAN network. I was looking around at options such as zerotier, nebula, tailscale, headscale, yggdrasil, innernet, openziti, tinc and wireguard and I think wireguard might be my best option as I read that it uses the least amount of resource. Also I want a free and open source and self hosted option.
 I found some of the following tools on github:
 https://github.com/psyhomb/wireguard-tools
 https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird
 https://github.com/gravitl/netmaker
 https://github.com/tonarino/innernet
 I have zero experience setting up networks like this.
 Can I get a recommendation on a good guide and/or which tools I should use to set up the network I desire so any of my devices can be used from anywhere.
 I also understand that some setups require a server to be always on, is there any way around that? I am planning to run the wireguard server from my raspberry pi 3 that also has vaultwarden running. Also must I have a static IP address? My IP address changes sometimes / every few months. If it does, will I be able to easily modify wireguard?
 Also, if there is a better alternative, please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The nginx proxy manager is running in docker and listening to port 80. 
 I set it up so that, at the end, the source is http://example.com and the destination (a web app running in the same server) is http://example.com:5000. In terms of the diagram here 
 https://forums.unraid.net/topic/110245-support-nginx-proxy-manager-npm-official/
 The “Domain name” and “Forward host to” are http://example.com, the port is 5000, and scheme is http. 
 The domain http://example.com:5000 correctly resolves to the expected destination web page. The expectation is that, when I enter http://example.com, it will be forwarded to http://example.com:5000, but it doesn’t. I get a page from NPM that you have successfully set up NPM, but your destination is not correctly set up. 
 What could be wrong? How to troubleshoot?
 Initially I suspected docker networking might be the issue. I thought the destination resolves inside docker, which is not defined. But the NPM docker network is a bridge, so the destination DNS query should be able to get out of the docker and resolve in host. 
 The application in destination also runs in docker, but with ports mapped in the host. As noted, http://example.com:5000 is indeed accessible.
 I tried other destinations also: localhost, internal IP address of the host, docker interface Ip, etc.

 Been doing a ton of reading/research this morning on the topic, but I can’t seem to get on firm ground for a game storage strategy.
 Currently, I have a desktop PC which I built and use to emulate like 8 consoles worth of games. Many of these games are ISOs or folders that take up a lot of space per game.
 I no longer have access to a free unlimited google drive account which I had about 1.5Tb of data on so I need a migration plan.
 I also plan on adding much more data to emulate some of my PS3 games. I’ll probably ideally love to have upwards of 4-5Tb of storage. But I know the SSD price point sucks there. Open to a hybrid drive like Barracuda. I have an internal Barracuda drive and it’s fast to me!
 I’m not overly concerned about redundancy per se as I have the original discs for many of these games. I can get them all ripped again but it would be annoying. I’m primarily concerned about dependability/longevity with performance second.
 I just ordered a 2Tb 2.5 SATA SSD and a USB 3.0 enclosure for it. My PC does not use USB-C ports. I also have available space internally for another M.2 and another 2.5 drive.
 I’d appreciate some insight. I figured external is the way to go for game storage and continue to store the emulator executables on my system (c) m.2 SSD.

 They all seem to work in single CPU systems but the prices vary quite a bit on eBay between these. 
 Should I go for the best combination of price, cores, TDP or is there more to it than that between single, dual, and quadruple capable Xeons?
 It’s to put in a Z440 workstation with 128GB RAM running proxmox. Currently running an E5-1620v4. 
 Main concern is power usage as a kWh is 0.30$ here. Workload is containers and VMs.

 I don't have a rack, but I do have a lot of shelf space, and I have my old workhorse which sits in my basement that deserves some accolades. It's the Ford F150 of virtualization servers. It's running mostly hardware ranging between 2014-2017, but it serves literally everything in my house and has more than enough overhead for anything else I'd require or add to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So backstory: I have 2 NAS systems in my house, one is a Synology box that I'm getting close to 8yrs old on, and another TrueNAS custom made using a Rosewill RSV-L4500 case. One of the drives on my Synology started reporting bad sectors, so I decided to take this as an opportunity to move everything over to TrueNAS and sell off the Synology NAS, just to simplify everything to just one device and to finally go full ZFS.
 My current setup on TrueNAS is a striped pool of mirrored vdevs of 2 8 TB drives each, so about ~28TB of usable space. I want to add another 4 drives, which maxes out the case's drive capacity.
 Adding those 4 drives in the same mirrored pool will give me 46TB in usable space, but it got me thinking if I want to use RAIDZ pools instead for this may drives (12 Total).
 Some basic calculations I did were:
  
MIRROR 6 Groups of 2 8TB drives: 46TB -- adding to existing pool
 RAIDZ1 3 Groups of 4 8TB drives: 67TB 
 RAIDZ1 2 Groups of 6 8TB drives: 74TB 
 RAIDZ1 1 Group of 12 8TB drives: 82TB 
 RAIDZ2 3 Groups of 4 8TB drives: 44TB
 RAIDZ2 2 Groups of 6 8TB drives: 61TB
 RAIDZ2 1 Group of 12 8TB drives: 70TB
  
I understand that mirrored is would be better because rebuilds on failures would be faster than relying on parity etc, but would redoing the pool groups of RAIDZ be better longevity vs usable space? Mostly considering that at this point I can never upgrade this pool again physically (unless I get a different chasis/case but thats a whole other project in itself) but I obviously care about redundancy on failures as well.
 ​
 Does anyone have any recommendations/insights/experiences?

So can I feel proud of the fact that I'm self-hosting things? And can I show off the docker containers to people who are less tech-savvy than me? I want to show them this server that I made.

 This is some sort of philosophical thing that I don't understand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello to all, 
 briefly about my environment:
 Main Server:
 i5-8600 CPU
 32 GB RAM 1 TB SSD
 With Proxmox running my main VM's/Container's.
 Main NAS:
 Qnap TS-451D2
 4x 8TB WD Purple 
 Raid 10
 I am planning a new NAS with 4x 10 TB WD RED, Ryzen 7 2700X and 16 GB RAM And don't know exactly how to implement it.
 Either I would set up a Nextcloud VM in Proxmox, since the hardware is a bit more powerful, and I might want to run other VMs afterwards or even shut down my other compute server.
 Now the question is what is better Proxmox, Unraid or TrueNas?
 In the end, I only want the most stable and failsafe solution, because I am afraid of data loss. Backups will be made, of course.
 A ready-made NAS solution always gives me security, but I need a more powerful NAS, which can also AI image detection.
 Personally, AI image recognition is most important to me as I am looking for a strong tool to manage my images.
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Thank you for all comments.

 I am working on the next version of the PoeticMetric (privacy-first Google Analytics alternative), and I am going to make it free and open source. However, I would like to learn how people manage their deployments nowadays, so I can provide easy deployment options. For now, I am thinking of shipping with a production-ready docker-compose.yaml, and kubernetes manifests or helm chart is the only other option I can think of. So, how do you manage your deployments?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Way back in 1995 I backed up a machine onto a sizeable stack of floppies using MS-DOS 6.2 MSBACKUP.EXE. I've imaged the discs, pulled them into a VM and confirmed that they're readable... so that's cool. The only issue is that I have no idea what password I would have set on them 27 years ago.
 Since the passwords were max 8 characters, I'm presuming if I could put the set through a password cracker it shouldn't take too long to break it. Problem is I have no idea where to start.
 I've looked to see if the file format is well known (it does not appear to be documented). 
 I've considered trying to write/build some type of automation that runs on top of the VM to automate the keyboard input/screen reading, but I'm not sure what toolset to start with to build that. I'm reasonably technical enough to string together tools with some code/script if someone could point me in the right direction.
 At this point, I'm more curious than anything else as to what's on those disks and if they're truly recoverable this many years later.
 Any thoughts, direction would be appreciated.

It really has very little if any advantage over 2.5" SSD 4TB, which are retailed at $237 the cheapest. The fact is 3.5" HDD are still growing toward higher capacity, while 2.5in HDD market just silently died.
 I'm thinking about to make an offline backup with a 2.5" HDD, but it seems this is not a viable path any more.

Is this something similar to the bulldozer cpu debacle with amd, (Claimed 8 core on a 4 core chip) or is there a bios setting I might be able to access to utilize all cores on all 4 chips?
 Also, is there a way to set the fan speed? It's a bit loud sitting on my desk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently using WikiJS for my documentation and such.
 Things I like about WikiJS:
 - Plenty of customization/administration
 - Syncs plain text to S3 storage (using Cloudflare R2)
 Things I don't like about it:
 - Clunky UI, interface, and editor
 - Pages are slow to render
 - Half of the features are "coming soon"
 - Directory structure/hierarchy/navigation is difficult to use properly (at least for me)
 ​
 I was thinking of moving to Bookstack. I already have this installed from when I was testing a few other solutions.
 I've heard issues with Bookstack breaking URL's, is that still an issue I should be worried about?
 I've also heard that if the Bookstack docker/OS dies/corrupts, the data is useless because it uses a database and not plain text. If I sync my docs to S3 storage, are they stored in plain text there or will I need the database? My goal is to be able to have access to all of my documentation if my entire environment collapses. Having plain text files in Cloudflare R2 achieves that goal.
 ​
 *Please do not suggest Obsidian, Joplin, Trilium, etc. as I've tried them all. The only one I still want to try is Outline Wiki, but the setup is too complex just to set up for testing purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently purchased a refurbed Exos 16TB drive. I cleared the drive, ran stress tests on it, then threw it in my array. SMART data was fine etc.
 2 Days later, while trying to add another drive to my array, this drive starts throwing out errors every second. I reached out to the vendor who said they'd replace it no problem. Trouble is, the drive has highly sensitive data, and DBAN fails when trying to scrub. How comfortable would you be at that point sending the drive back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got my first rack and after some blunders got everything together. It's not obnoxiously loud most of the time, but its noticeable in the background. Got a Dell R620 with dual E5-2643 V2 chips. I read someone had mentioned Mass Loaded Vinyl as an option and I wanted to know if anyone had experience creating a "wall" out of one for the sides of the rack, and if that actually dampened the volume. I thought about using the insert holes on the sides of the rack to affix a panel to the side.
 ​
 Secondly, I grabbed a static rack kit from dell not quite realizing what static really implied, which wouldn't be a huge deal but when I attempted to remove the server, I can pull it out about 6 inches and then it almost seems to catch on something and won't come out further. Anyone experience that, is that normal? I pretty much have to remove the rails and make sure there is lots of clearance around the rack if I ever want to take it out all the way (and I'm dreading the thought).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all,
 A while back I got started using terraform to create/manage VMs on my proxmox homelab (thank you to those of you who have shared blog posts about this). 
 One thing that bothered me was how I was essentially copy/pasting the resource definitions when I wanted to create a new VM, so I recently went through a big refactor to reduce the amount of configuration required to create a new vm and wanted to share with this community in case others find it useful. With this setup I can now define a new VM with three lines of yaml, push my changes and have them deployed by the gitlab ci/cd pipeline. 
 https://github.com/nohbdy1745/proxmox-terraform 
 I have this deployed on a gitlab instance running in a proxmox VM, with gitlab managing my terraform state, and have the gitlab ci/cd pipeline setup so I can push changes to my terraform configuration and have them deployed from there. I set it up so that you don't need to have gitlab managed terraform state, you would just have to change the backend in main.tf and you can use the make commands to run everything. 
 Hope this is useful to someone else. I'm also not an expert with terraform so if you happen to take a look and have feedback please let me know!

 Basically I have a couple of external drives for cold storage that take up space and I want to chuck them into my case. I was going to shuck them but leave the USB to SATA logic board intact and route the USB and AC power cable through PCIe slot into the case. Unfortunately the logic board prevents the drives from being mounted properly in my Node 304 case (also, somehow my WD Reds and another Seagate drive only support 3 screw mounts? Did Fractal mess up?).

 selfhost/docker Beginner here. I already got some applications running, yay!
 But I´m currently stuck with hosting a mail/smtp application. I already tried the docker-mailserver, mailcow and as webinterfaces rainloop and sogo. But to be quite honest I am a little bit stunned by the complexity (a lot of services, ports,...) and amount of errors I am getting. I got not a single option to run correctly. I don´t know where to start.
 For me the topic selfhosted mail is the next logical step, because a lot of applications require an smtp server.
 So, had anyone a similar experience? Can someone recommend a proper, simple image or guide? What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I’ve been looking for a new analog transfer device for a while to transfer hi-8 and VHS tapes. I bought a cheap easy-cap like device, and it sucked. It was causing a lot of artifacting, frame drops, highlight blowout and just something I wouldn’t trust to transfer several hours worth of important footage.
 With Christmas around the corner, I’ve decided to treat myself with a good quality transfer device. Only problem is, I can’t find the right one. Most of the suggestions I’ve found online and on Reddit are extremely dated or way too advanced for my current setup.
 I’ve heard good things about the Hauppage HD PVR, elgato analog capture, and black magic intensity shuttle cards, but so many people have suggested different approaches that I don’t know which one to try. Everything from TBCs, scalers, passthroughs, to PCIs, I don’t even know if I’m getting the right thing.
 I want to get a good quality device that I can use with my laptop and camcorder without having to drop hundreds of bucks and uproot my entire setup. My main goal is to save these videos to a digital format while losing as little of the picture quality as possible. I’d greatly appreciate any suggestions for what I should invest in.

 I appreciate this isn't really a self hosted product, but if any sub on reddit knows the answer to my question, it's going to be you guys!
 I've managed to fumble my way through cloudflare zero tier to add GitHub as an identity provider, but how do I restrict which github accounts can access my tunnel - at the minute every account can log in. Is this even possible?
 Edit: Solution in the comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My current homeserver is getting too small.
 I currently have a board that barely holds my GPU and ssd extension card. For future plans I need a mainboard that has more slots but I wonder if there is any workstation focused mainboard out there. Or are the gaming mainboards already the best to get when it comes to connectivity?
 ​
 The scenario:
 I have a server that runs Proxmox. I then have a bunch VMs/containers for my workload. All pretty basic except the gaming VM. I passthroguh my GPU, mouse and keyboard and connect to a screen.
 I might need more connectivity for that vm. E.g. to handle sound easily. I was thinking to buy a Thunderbolt extension card, also give that to the VM and then simply connect a docking station to it and be good. But for that I need at least one more card in the system... which does not fit currently.

To acquire new material, I need to be connected to a VPN. Is there a way to have my server on a VPN while leaving it accessible to the world outside my network? If not, is it possible to have a directory auto backup to the server, and would this be easier accomplished on windows or Linux?

I have a safe where I put HDDs with some accounting records and for that matter it has work for years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a very basic server with Oracle Cloud free tier, and I managed to use Cloudflare and Nginx Proxy Manager to reroute my subdomains with the certifications and everything. However, the only way I get it to work is to expose each container port in my ingress rules on the Oracle server. 
 To my understanding (noob here), the idea of using Nginx is to be able just to expose the usual ports (80, 443) and let the rerouting to go behind that, without the need to expose rest of ther ports. Am I correct?
 I'm not sure what additional information I could give to help solve the issue, let me know if there is anything I can add.
 Thanks in advance for the support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Pretty much as per the title. Need a CRM to handle VERY simple tasks for software tech support. Basically need to be able to create some customers, associate them to incoming email addresses from our support address (simple SMTP/IMAP), create support items specific to them (usually stemming from said emails), assign to a team member, flag them as complete, etc, etc. Nothing too crazy, small 3-5 person team. Played with self-hosted Oodo but looks like way overkill and only one "app" for free version so that looks to end that scheme. PLayed with SuiteCRM but I seemed to be getting random errors, lag, etc (this was on a Windows install with XAMPP).
 Any thoughts, even if cloud based but free (if that exists) I suppose would work. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, not sure if this is the right place to ask but I'm going to try.
 I have a 14TB WD easystore that's been working for just over a year now. Yesterday, I noticed it was mounting and unmounting rapidly, so I ejected it and restarted the computer. 
 When I turned the computer back on it would no longer mount, the discs aren't spinning and there was a slow, white flashing from the LED indicator. I immediately looked up all the troubleshooting guides and did the following. 
  
Switched USB cables (used my other easystore's usb)
 plugged into a dedicated wall outlet
 checked windows device manager and un-checked "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" - restarted pc
 opened disc management, where it is not visible and there is no drive letter for it at all
 updated drivers 
 allowed hidden items in serial bus drivers
  
After frustration I stopped everything all together. This morning I plugged it in and there is still no disc spinning activity, and now the LED blinks rapidly. Is this thing bricked? I have 13.9 TBs on it and would really hate to lose it all. I had it propped up on fans and it was well maintained, and of course there is no power or reset button on these things.
 Any suggestions? It's still warrantied for another year. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have personal data (general, plus DSLR and GoPro photos/videos for Lightroom/Final Cut Pro), business data (including lots of big image files, say 1GB per file, 200GB currently), and my computer setup to back up. I don't generally save images/videos on my internal SSD.
 My current setup looks like this:
  
2TB external HD for photo/video storage 2.5"
 5TB external HD for business data storage 2.5"
 I also have a 2TB external SSD for temporary photo/video storage for faster editing. This only ever contains duplicates from the 2TB HD
 4TB external HD for backing up both the 2TB and the 5TB external HDs (yeah, the 4TB was here first, when I had 2x 2TB, but my business 2TB failed so I upgraded that to a 5TB... thus the stupid size relations)
 1TB time machine external HD for backing up my Mac setup/internal SSD
 iDrive Cloud for backing up my Time Machine, 2TB photo and 5TB business HD.
  
​
 Problem: My photo/video 2TB external HD is getting really full, only 10% space left... I started taking more videos, which take up a huge amount of space.
 Now I'm really torn as to how to smartly upgrade my backup setup.
  
Should I get a big external HD, maybe 6TB, to replace the current stupid 4TB backup HD, and use the 4TB backup HD for photos and videos instead?(I could even use the 4TB just for videos, leave my photos on the current 2TB photo/video HD). If so, should I get a 2.5" or 3.5" for the 6TB? I don't really need to move it, it should stay on my desk, but is there still an advantage to 3.5" these days at all?
 Or should I rather get a second smallish (2TB) external HD to put the videos on, so that the current photo/video HD only contains photos, and leave the backup 4TB as is for now?
  
​
 Trying to save money atm, but also want a sustainable solution...
 Which option do you suggest and why?
 Feel free to also add other sensible options that I'm missing here!
 ​
 Thanks so much!

 Does anyone know if there are any programs like stash that i can use to acess my downloaded youtube videos from my web browser on my lan in an aesthetically pleasing way?
 I do not want to use plex as while i have that setup and it is good on the tv i would love something a bit more browser focussed for accessing in web browsers on my computers to go along with stash, calibre, kiwix, sonarr, radarr etc.

 I installed both Proxmox and Ubuntu without any problem, but when I try to boot I just can't.
 I disabled secure boot from the BIOS settings and enabled Legacy mode, I downgraded BIOS firmware, but nothing worked.
 The computer previously had a 1TB hard disk, I installed Ubuntu on it and it won't boot either.
 Before I formatted the hard disk had Windows on it and it worked. My thoughts are that maybe the computer has some Linux block, so it can't boot Linux.
 Is there someone who maybe had the same issue and can help me?
 Thanks!

 TLDR: What do you use for your home NAS (OS or Appliance)? Do you have a separate computer/server to run apps and use your NAS for storage?
 A few months ago, I switched from OMV to TrueNAS SCALE. I wanted stability and ease of use for my NAS because my family also relies on my NAS. I found OMV to be buggy, and not intuitive. In my opinion, I could not trust OMV. Now I am considering going back to OMV.
 TrueNAS SCALE has been great for me, at least if I used the very basic features of having a ZFS pool with a few SMB/NFS shares, but I wanted to run apps as well, such as Plex, Nextcloud, etc..., but that has been the biggest hassle for me, and I miss being able to use Docker Compose and apps just working.
 I added TrueCharts to my NAS to get all the apps I would want to run but li…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not sure if anyone here archives games, or has experience with Minecraft, but is there any way to have a Minecraft launcher, such as the titan launcher, for offline use? What I mean is, if you use the titan launcher you still have to download any version you might want to play. What I'm looking for is a launcher that already has ALL Minecraft versions built in so I can just play it wherever and whenever and require no internet connection whatsoever. I want this for purposes of archiving the game on an external HDD, since I'm a big data hoarder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wanted to take some time and rave about Frigate NVR. I just installed it a couple days ago on home assistant and wow. For my personal use, It blows Agent DVR (Which I had been using for several months) out of the water. Here are some of my favorite points:
  
Accuracy is phenomenal for AI detections. This was always an issue with Agent DVR for me. It would detect my oil tank and christmas lights as people with up to 80% confidence level. Even sunset shadows it would be up to 70% confident it was people. By the time I masked these out almost 1/2 of the screen was gone. Zero false positives so far with Frigate and no masks.
 Clips are so smooth.
 CPU (Not using Coral) usage is extremely low and getting 15 to 19ms inference times on Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 (Running HAOS Arm64 as a Hyper-V VM on Windows Dev Kit 2023). This is something I could not have said when I was running Agent DVR. AI detection with CodeProject.AI was usually hitting 40-60% CPU utilization on a 12 core i5 1240p. Agent DVR always idled at around 12% CPU utilization.

I watched Cooptonioan's video but that only covers disabling MFA for the local network whereas my goal would be to trust anyone that connects from the local network (thus disabling authentication) which is absolutely needed for the wife acceptance factor. How can this be achieved?
 PS setup was done based on GeeksCircuit guide.

 I have a few os options, originally i was going to install proxmox ve, truenas, home assistant, ubuntu for docker containers, windows ect. I would like to just run windows server as a host os because if there is an issue in windows there is a much higher chance of me being able to fix it on my own without hours of googleing. I would like to have a standard smb share for my files, raid 10 6 hdd probably, but i would also like some sort of web interface that i can upload or download files from if i can't use smb for whatever reason. I have been told by people that storage spaces in windows is a nightmare though.
 Any advice will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have the opportunity to buy around 50 500GB HDDs still sealed in their original packaging (about USD 4.50 per drive), and was wondering if it would be worth getting any. 
 Based on this thread, it seems that the best use would be to just (re)sell the drives or offer upgrade services; and that building something with them would be quite inefficient due to high power requirements relative to the storage space available. Any other ideas on what else could be done with these drives? Or would those two suggestions still be the best advice today? 
 Also, these drives are somewhat old (manufactured 2015, ~7 years ago). If the HDDs have been factory sealed all this time, would they still be very likely to work, or would there be some form of degradation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I am selfhosting a lot of services like plex, nextcloud, adguard, ... and I would like to have good perf for R/W for the services.
 Specs: - I have multiple proxmox host for HA (like Dell optiplex) - I use the ZFS features (so this storage will be on ZFS). - Storage should be on 10Gb 
 I think all the virtual disks would be on this new storage but there is a problem because I need : - SSD (good perf) for virtual disks of VMs - HDD for data (like movies, doc, pic, ...)
 --> So I think I would go with 2 zfs pools
 My questions are : - Which bay storage (with ECC Ram) should I use for my case ? SAN, NAS, DAS ? - What's the size of your pool and what kind of disk? - Where are your virtual disk, host side or dedicated storage reachable via NFS ? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for an app to real-time receive and plot sensor data (through TCP, sent by MCU with wifi) and save them for future analyzing. Like a PC oscilloscope.
 The features I need are: 1. Real-time receive and plotting 2. Data source can be TCP socket or named pipe (whatever as long as I can write a python script to be a middle converter) 3. Allow me to select a x-axis range to save a part of received data
 I've tried: - PulseView (can't real-time continuously receive) - LabPlot (KDE) (can't select a part of received data to save. And easy to crash) - Audacity (which is a sound wave editing software. Good for range selecting, but, can't set real-time data source to be other than mic. And can't show the wave if Y value larger than 1)
 Thank you guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been poking around trying to find a solution for archiving threads from various automotive forums. For anyone who doesn't use these forums, they have been dying over the years as people move to other social media platforms and with the decline in usage comes a decline in maintenance. Sometimes all the images disappear, videos get removed, or whole forum domains go down. Most of what's on these forums isn't super useful but there's a handful of threads showing highly custom stuff that is relevant to my own projects.
 I would like to be able to archive a thread in its entirety for later reference to include images, videos, and other links. I played around with ArchiveBox some and archiving with a link depth of 1 seems to gather all that, but also grabs all the other irrelevant links that are on a forum page that I don't care for. I also can only archive a thread one page at a time using ArchiveBox, which doesn't work for threads that might go on for hundreds of pages.
 I did some research and I think what I am looking for is a web scraper tool that can snag all the thread posts and associated links on a page, then cycle to the next page in the thread and repeat until all the pages have been archived....so with all that being said I am looking for recommendations for tools that might fit this use case.
 Since I don't think there's much overlap between self hosters and people who frequent the forums (though I might be wrong) here are two links of example threads that I would love to make sure I have indefinite access to (so long as I maintain my homelab).
  
Example 1
 Example 2

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wonder if anybody else is having this problem: I'm one of the hosts of mintCast, I also manage the mintCast.org web server on a raspberry pi in my basement. In addition to that I host a Nextcloud instance that we use for our infrastructure. Though I've got Nextcloud running on bare metal, I've got the collabora server running in a docker container on the same machine. All of this is sitting behind and Nginx reverse proxy manager which itself is running in a docker container. The problem I'm having is when I try to embed calendars from next cloud onto the WordPress site I get an error on next cloud saying it cannot copy the HTML code to the clipboard. All of the SSL is sorted. Everything behind the reverse proxy has a self-signed certificate which the proxy trusts and then Nginx handles the external stuff with let's encrypt. I've also noted that I cannot copy and paste directly onto next cloud office documents. At least not with the mouse I have to use control v etc. I'm wondering if there's something I need to pass to the reverse proxy to give stuff like next cloud behind the rivers proxy access to the clipboard. If anybody knows anything about this I would greatly appreciate it

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping my fellow homelab community can weigh in on this. I run a few websites that send email (~1-5k per month) and have a bunch of homelab stuff on different domains that sends transactional emails (~500 per month).
 I have been using Mailgun for the last few years and whilst good, I have started having to pay each month as the amount of emails sent goes over the free tier. This has at most been around $6-$10 in a single month. I have been tying with the thought of switching over to amazon SES as its ridiculously cheaper. I then happened to stumble on the delights of Postal (postalserver.io).
 I am now stuck toying with the idea of SES or do I host my own Postal on a VPS somewhere? I send emails from roughly 20 different domains and would like to utilise security features where possible. I understand the issues with IP reputation that comes from email delivery.
 Am i better off just sticking with SES? Overall it will probably be cheaper. Or do I go Postal with slightly more VPS monthly cost but with the freedom and much better UI / dashboards?
 ​
 OR even better can I host Postal on AWS and get postal to send via SES and utilise the 62k free emails per month (i assume this either wont work or will require each domain to be verified in SES anyway?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there. I am very sure that my self-hosted AdGuard Home container is causing problems for me.
 I am currently often playing Modern Warfare 2 in the evening / night and I am playing and the Steam connection is randomly lost. First I thought of the Steam servers of course but I'm the only one with problems. It happens every day or at least every second day. And then the connection is lost and won't reconnect for at least 5 minutes I guess. Then it often works again.
 I tried to change the DNS server in the settings of my ethernet adapter on Windows 11 (to 8.8.8.8 e.g. instead of the local server) where I have my server 192.168.178.xx and as second 1.1.1.1 and flushed the DNS and it instantly worked again. So it seems to be that it has something to do with my DNS by AdGuard Home. But how the hell I am I supposed to really validate it or better fix it?
 The internet stays online while this disconnect in Steam is happening. Everything keeps working. Only Steam is not.
 Does anybody have an idea? I am pretty sure its caused by the DNS...

 I've just tried them back-to-back with some 10g server ports ( for link/ping tests ) and that doesn't seem to function either. Does anyone have these running with copper interface SFP+ modules? Do you have a part number if so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've recently gotten my hands on an HP DL380 G6 that I cannot for the life of me get to post. No matter what I've tried I cannot get any video output, not even as much as seeing the HP splash screen. Any help is greatly appreciated.
 I can't reach iLO by domain name, and does not show up in device list on my router so I cannot find an IP address (server may not even have a valid license).
 Last owner of the server was able to reach the BIOS, and did not make any configuration changes before I got it.
 Front panel indicators:
  
Server health indicator: solid green
 Server power indicator: solid green
 DIMMs: off
 Power supplies: off
 Processors: Solid amber
 Hard drive lights: come on for a split second and turn off almost immediately
 Fans: off
 Over temp: off
 Power cap: off
  
Fixes I've tried are as follows: 
  
Resocketing CPUs, along with running each CPU individually
 Running minimum amount of DIMMs
 Using only 1 power supply
 Resocketing the power supplies
 Swapping the power supplies
 Changing VGA port used 
 Did not try a different cable as I know for a fact the one I was using works
 
 Changing to a different monitor
 Flipping DIP switch 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping it off (turning server off and removing power supplies before flipping it each time obv)
 Flipping DIP switch 1, 5, 6 to on, letting system idle, then flipping them off
 Simply letting it sit for an hour or so to see if it was just taking an absurd amount of time to boot
  
If any more information is needed I'll happily provide it, and once again thank you for your help.

I've got a dedicated HP-109a with VMs and about 30 dockers. and I've had an HP microserver N40L running for over 10 years, most of it running on unRAID. It's got about 7 disks in It. Some 4TB, 3TB, 2TB etc.. About 15TB in total. N40L is getting a bit old now.. it for the most part shares out large media files over jellyfin. 
 Was thinking of just getting 1 x 20TB disk in the HP-109a and having that as my NAS and container server & VMs.. it should handle the load OK.. i Can keep the N40L as an offline backup... I can live with loosing a week or so of data without parity. Don't think I need the RAID performance.. any other considerations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I've created a dual-boot PC for myself so I can learn how to use Linux and hopefully transition away from Windows. 
 I want to have my PC automatically backup all its data. However, there are a lot of different ways to backup PCs, and I'm not sure which methods/programs would work best for my situation. 
 I've looked through the r/DataHoarder Wiki and I have a rough idea of what a backed-up PC should look like, but my problem is that there are a lot of backup tools and programs out there and I don't know which I should use. "I'm trapped by overchoice." 
 I also can't seem to find any guides on what can and can't be done when trying to backup a dual-boot PC. Can one operating system backup both itself and the other operating system, or do both operating systems need to have their own backups? 
 As to my current situation. I have about 1TB of personal data (I save a lot of movies, music, and images). I currently have all my data saved on a 2TB external USB HDD. My dual-boot PC is set up, but I haven't installed anything on it yet because I want to make sure I have a backup system all set up first. I have a bit of a "hodgepodge" of drives. I have:
  
Two 500GB SSDs as my boot drives for Linux and Windows respectfully
 One 500GB HDD I salvaged from my mom's old desktop.
 One 750GB HDD I salvaged from my old Toshiba laptop
 One 2TB HDD that serves as my PC's internal "bulk storage" drive for all the music, videos, and images. 
 One external USB 2TB HDD that I've been using as my backup drive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking at Restic, BackupPC and Borg right now and trying to figure out if either of them support pre- and post-commands.
 The reason is that I would like to run a few exporters first, like so:
 ``` sysupgrade -b $outname.tar.gz # Also supports printing to STDOUT, but its always .tar.gz mysqldump ... # To dump all tables, users, ...
 ... others ...
 rsync serve $type wasabi-crypt:/backups ```
 After that, I might want to run cleanup commands.
 I will be running this on: - GNU/Linux, Debian 11 - linux, OpenWrt
 As for my windows maschines, it's quite straight forward: just a directory list and possibly LudoSavi... but thats a worry for another day. First, I need to get my cruicial infrastructure (router, servers) backed up.
 As for the backend: I am using Wasabi with an encryption setup - I want to use it as my off-site backup, purely. Hence rclone mount .... I did see Restic can do that on it's own (making me believe it might just consume the RClone API) but I am not sure if Borg can.
 In the end, I am also not sure if I want to use multiple repositories or not; probably depends on the program.
 Would love if you could give me some input on this! Thanks so much :)

 Following a a power...blip? the other day, StableBit Scanner is reporting a handful of them with unreadable sectors.
 Every single drive where damage was reported is in a single QNAP enclosure.
 Number of sectors unreadable on all affected drives: 1, 1, 1, 8, 61, 44240
 Only two media files were affected (99%+ intact) and were recovered via Scanner. The "most damaged" drive amounted to 21MiB in terms of storage.
 Scanner reports all drives as otherwise healthy, and no SMART flags to check
 I manually confirmed that all affected drives are reporting 0 for Reallocated Sectors, Reallocation Events, Pending Sectors, Uncorrectable Sectors (I guess that last one doesn't make sense to me)
 My two questions are:
 Should I treat this as "the beginning of the end" for these drives, or not?
 Would a UPS have probably avoided this event?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got my storage start on HardForums storage showoff threads in around 2008 and I miss that format quite a lot so I think it's about time we recreate it here. The basic idea is to post pictures of your setup, detail the spec and tell us what you use your storage for.
 Here's an example post format...
  
 Amount of total storage (Raw/Formatted/Config)
 Case
 PSU
 CPU
 RAM
 Motherboard
 Controller Cards (if any)
 Drives (include full model numbers)
 Operating System
 A paragraph or two describing what you use your storage for and how you handle backups and organizing and maybe future upgrade plans.
 Gallery of images (use imgur gallery format not separate image links)
  
 We will run this thread every 6 months or so and update the post to feature the most upvoted, discussed and interesting systems! Have fun!! 
 P.S. Some of you may remember where I was when I first joined DH, from this thread and it's about time I post a new one so I'll join you in posting my current setup should this go well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would rather self -host on my own computer. So from my understanding i need two things
  
Back-end service (the one that has vikunja-unstable-windows-4.0-386.exe in the folder)
 Front-end service such as the desktop client
  
Standard ports are already taken by XAMPP and i haven't configured "config.yml.sample" BUT for the sake of testing I don't have xampp running.
 I tried running it out of the box but the last line of code is:
 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8258504-05:00: INFO ▶ [EVENTS] 093 Starting handler, subscriber_name=namespace.created.namespace.counter.increase, topic=namespace.created 
 Meanwhile it says at the first lines
 2022/12/14 16:38:02 No config file found, using default or config from environment variables. 2022-12-14T16:38:02.8222434-05:00: INFO ▶ migration/Migrate 04e Ran all migrations successfully. 
 I'm pretty sure to configure the yaml file i need to remove .sample but it should work out of the box without configuring it right? Mind you during this test i'm not running any server on localhost.
 I run the client and the prompt says
 An error occurred: TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL Please check if the api url is correct. 
 After inserting the default port in the address:
 Could not find or use Vikunja installation at "localhost". Please try a different url. 
 What do i do now?

File permissions have been ridiculously annoying while on linux and I wanted to change to ext4. I have had success in some ways with hfsplus mounting but I can not share the drives or do anything I really want lol.
 Does the Probox work as ext4 or zfs? I did not want to do NTFS but...I would prefer it to HFS+ at this point. 
 If yes to ext4 and/or NTFS: If I format one drive at a time, would that work? Or would I lose/corrupt data on the other 2 drives? I am asking because I was hoping to copy as much data to 2 of the drives, wipe, then transfer data back. Do this for all 3
 Do I manually remove the drive from the enclosure or can I format a drive, one at a (I have no idea how raid really works or if this is actually a raid setup). 
 Thank you guys!

This program looked like an ideal file sync program for me. However, I discovered that one of my favorite YouTubers made a nice tutorial about file syncing using a program known as "Resilio". I don't know which of these two programs to pick, so I was wondering if anyone here has used Resilio and could give a review of the program, and maybe talk about how it compares to other file sync programs.

Rack mount
 Super quiet, upgrades or swapping out for consumer / quiet is fine, but it must be quiet 
 The SuperMicro SQ PSU is not that quiet, I have that also, its still loud, but quieter than a jet turbine hahaa
 
 Maximum bays count
 Good build quality, I don't want cheap chassis to kill me with slow death of annoyance and failure

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm not sure if this is the right sub, but I tried posting on r/buildapc and it didn't get any responses. I've moved recently, and I'm on a new build estate which seems to be suffering with brown outs a few times a week. I've been told this will stop next year as the other side of the estate is connected, however it's worrying me a little as my NAS, PC and Mac mini have all been unexpectedly shutdown a few times. I'd like to attach:
  
Synology DS1817+ (5-60W)
 PC (750wPSU) (70-500W)
 Mac Mini (2-80W)
 Network gear (50-100W complete guess as I've not attached the meter yet)
  
I'm not much of a gamer, so the PC is very rarely pulling 500W+, it tends to idle at 70W and normal use may take it to 150W. I've been looking at a few of the calculators and for 3 minutes runtime something rated around the 1500VA/900W seems to be recommended. I've got no experience with UPSs at home, we use Eaton at work, but I've never had much to do with their configs. I think I can budget around £300, but I could stretch that a little. I've got some rack gear, so I'm open to either rack or freestanding units. These models seem to come up, or their rack equivalent:
  
CyberPower CP1500EPFCLCD
 Powercool Smart UPS 2000VA
 APC BX1600MI
 Eaton 5P850i
  
I'd be grateful for any feedback, recommendations and I can provide any other info if it helps. I'm slightly confused by the price differences for similar headline specs, I'm not sure if this is just a brand thing or some feature I should be focussing on. Any recommendation for the software setup, mainly for the Mac and NAS as they are always on. 
 Thanks in advance :-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a while and I'm a bit confused. As many others, my lab is composed of (close to) free stuff I gathered for years, I'd rather make things work with what I have.
 I recently upgraded my simple network (fritzbox + fritzrepeater, main network + guest access) to a more complex setup: fritzbox (as a vdsl modem), apu4c board running opnsense, Netgear GS324T managed switch, fritz repeater as an AP.
 As you can see, the fritzbox and the repeater are now far apart thus the mesh feature stopped working and with it the guest access, that's to be expected. What I don't understand is the following: for the guest access to work between the fritzbox and the repeater, there has to be some vlan shenningans, I doubt AVM invented a brand new mechanism to separate traffic. My guess was that somehow all fritzbox ports were trunked with the default vlan being for the main network and all traffic from guest access was tagged with a vlan id.
 I tried setting it up like that, but I couldn't identify the vlan id (tried a bunch but that's tedious and I'm unsure how to inspect traffic at the switch, never done port mirroring before, not sure how to use linux to listen to it).
 Anyway, my question is, does anyone know if AVM could be using some other technology? Is there another way to use a fritz repeater to have two separate networks?

 I'm wondering what "poster" is. Is it the front cover of the DVD case? like this https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/e8EAAMXQAx9RN3Lq/s-l500.jpg ? I'm asking because Kodi doesn't use "cover.jpg."
 Also do you prefer the naming scheme above or you just use "cover.jpg", like so:
 + Name of Movie (YEAR) - Name of Movie (YEAR).mp4 - cover.jpg

 What's the best drive I can find regarding power consumption + silent and preferably 5400 RPM for 12TB+?
 Thanks!

Wanted something small that could be tucked away in a corner but have enough to run the few VM's I use and came across this (MINIS FORUM U820). Not supper powerful, but out of the box, this thing is quick. I kept the 512 M.2 drive it came with for holding ISO's and so on and added in 2 1TB SSD's and upgraded the RAM to 32GB. The only issue I have so far is vanilla ESXi 7 will not see either NIC, but vanilla ESXi 8 will see the 2.5GB port (which is what I needed). I am sure if I played around with it, I could get the 1GB port working. Just thought I would pass this along for anyone looking at something small.

 What do you do? Generic host names? Numbering? Software names? Anything creative? Do you follow a theme like greek letters/zodiacs/whatever?
 router dot domain is not that creative, neither is media dot domain. I saw someone using planets or stars but I guess that could become messy and not that obvious when debugging stuff not touched for a long time

 I'm living in europe and I've noticed that electricity prices in my area (Germany) have been exponentially increasing, thanks to Putin... (0,23€/kWh to 0,44€/kWh)
 I'm looking for ways to reduce my energy consumption and cut down on costs, and I'm wondering what measures other European homelabbers have taken to combat rising electricity prices.
 Currently i setup my Fujitsu Primergy RX600 S6 to only run from 9AM to 1AM so i can at lease save a third of the costs, by running it 16 hours a day im actually awake instead of 24/7. Also i configured power savings mode in iRMC. It is still running at 170 Watts.
 Any further advice, hints or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any way to fix the "status" indicator for non -arr apps added to Homarr?
 I don't use -arr services right now, but I like Homarr as my dashboard. Unfortunately, the little "online" indicators all show as offline, except for Dash. (dashdot). I know the services are online, but not sure how to fix this.
 I can remove these indicators by toggling the option within the advanced options tab, but it'd be nice to have a quick visual status indicator.
 Any ideas?
 First picture shows NPM as offline, but pings show otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone built a homelab storage solution that achieves: 
  
large sized volumes, say 30TB or larger (so simply using expensive SSD arrays isn’t an option)
 high IOPS, say 5-10k (so a simple mechanical array isn’t an option)
 utilizing 2.5GbE network capacity 
  
Or, if you wanted to build a NAS solution with about 30TB of working data, with lots of small I/O, and fully utilizing a 2.5GbE network, what would you build?
 Synology SSD read-write cache is insufficient, Intel CAS is commercial and is designed for Optane primarily I think, Intel SRT is discontinued, storage spaces with an SSD tier might be an option but they really want you to use an expensive Windows Server install and spaces seems to be unwieldy, Linux bcache might be an option, ZFS or Unraid with an SSD cache might be an option…

The 730xd has more drive space than I know what to do with, no optical bay, but has those fancy rear flex bays.
 I'm wondering if I can take a r730xd and swap the front section for the 8x3.5" from the r730. This way I can have my OS mirror, optical drive, and not feel bad for using 1/3 of the drive space. I don't see anything online about it though, and wanted to check here before I sacrifice my dvd drive.

 I built a new NAS a couple of months ago with a i3-10100 CPU @ 3.60GHz (Gigabyte B560M) and a number of WD Red HDDs based on TrueNAS Scale. It's fast and quiet, and really does everything that I could need it for.
 However, I also have a Synology DS920+ on the way from a friend who got a newer 923 from his work. He's only had the 920 for about 6 months. Knowing what I know about Syno, it'll also do the trick.
 My question is this: which one will last longer? Which is a better value proposition for things like Plex, the 'arr suite, and simple Time Machine/cold storage?
 I'm a little worried that what is essentially a gaming motherboard is going to wear out at a certain point, but I'm calling on all of your years experience: go with the DIY solution for the long run, or trust in the Syno, which I've seen people running for 8 years or so?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I purchased a SFP module from FS - GPON-ONU-34-20BI. And after ~1h port management and many other functions on UDM SE just stop working. Restart solves it but restarting a router every hour is extremely stupid. Ubiquiti support literally said to me that they don’t care because it isn’t their module. But the problem is that I can’t use theirs module because I need to change GPON SN and VendorID to get internet connection from my ISP. Do you have any SFP modules with changeable SN and VendorID to recommend? Of course it needs to work with UDM SE.
 TLDR: recommend any module that meets requirements in the title.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I asked this in /r/webdev and they suggested you folks could help me more:
 I have a niche website that currently has about a dozen TB of storage. As the website has started to grow, the data has started to become an issue....the hard drive I use to hold the files is no longer going to be able to hold it all. I'm estimating the storage will be 25-50TB, with about 50-100GB in daily bandwidth, at a minimum. So I need solutions with unlimited traffic.
 I am cheap, so using cloud providers like Azure, AWS is not really an option. I have noticed that Hetzner has cheap servers, with large hard drives (and empty slots for future growth). The issue I now see is the practical question of...how do I merge the hard drives while maintaining some level of protection against disk failure? If I have 3 HD…]]></summary>

 I don't have a ZFS server, but plan to build a modest one sometime in the future - so should I grab some Optane modules now before they are gone for good?
 Background: Optane solid state memory is great for write caching because unlike standard SSD storage it really won't wear out in any reasonable amount of time.

 So bit the bullet and today got a ZTE MC8020 5G CPE Router. It's arguably the best 5G router on the market (before ZTEs 6Ghz one drops in a few weeks). Without any tweaking I can get 300/50mbps solid with pings as low as 8ms. On my home fiber I was never offered anything better than 50/5mbps for the same price...
  
My question is how to I properly set up both the devices so they work together?
 I have every ethernet port of the AX88U populated. TV, PS5, 2x Gig Homelab, NV Shield, PC, etc. Previously I just connected the WAN port on the AX88U into the wall ethernet socket.

 Every now and again (4 times today) the internet will drop completely and will stay down until I reboot the ISP router. 
 I know it’s the ISP router as I plug an Ethernet cable directly into it, and there’s no internet. 
 Frustratingly, this seems to be happening more and more frequently, and the ISP can’t send an engineer until next week, so I’m looking to see if there’s anything anybody can suggest. 
 What’s even more odd is when I’m experiencing the issue the IP I get when plugging into the ISP router is not my WAN IP. When the issue isn’t happening, it is. 
 So the issue seems to be down to the ISP router doing something weird/wrong. 
 It’s driving me fucking crazy and I can’t handle another week before the engineer comes. The last three times I’ve rebooted, the connection has lasted for about 10-20 minutes and then it goes down again. Same issue as I’ve described above. 
 Anybody have any fucking idea?!

 I recently asked about downloading iCloud photos - You can find my post here.
 As I am now using gimme-iphoto for regularly downloading all of my photos, I found that there's certain metadata missing from certain files... What I found missing:
  
Any geolocation data - missing from any photo or video
 Date taken - missing from any screenshot or imported picture
  
I have also tried using a Mac and exporting the photos (by hand), but this information is also missing, whereas if I look at the photos' info boxes, even screenshots have dates attached to them.
 Is there any solution to download / export the files with this missing data?

 ​
 I've been testing some stuff with the new 10gb network, and I seem to have hit a strange issue. On Windows 10, running iperf to a TrueNAS box with 2 10Gb ports bondeed together, I am getting 6Gb/s on a single thread, which I don't think is too bad.
 ​
 But when I run multiple tests over time, it eventually drops to 2.4 ish....I thought maybe the NIC was overheating, but I ziptied a fan to it and it still seems to be having trouble. The drivers for this card were absolute dogshit to setup, and I'm to the point I"m probably going to grab an intel 10gb nic instead....
 ​
 Does anyone else have experience with 10gb that could tell me maybe why I'm getting this weirdly sudden and consistent drop in speed? I'm using an HPNC523SFP on both sides of the connection, with a Mikrotik CRS317 running SWOS in the middle here. The NAS Server is running Proxmox with the 2 ports bonded in lacp mode passed to a bridge that a TrueNAS VM is using. The ports are set both in active mode on the switch, and the client is just a plain ass Windows 10 box.
 ​
 I can't think of anything else significant I have configured here...

(This is a FQDN.) I have seen the docs and followed the various tips including adjusting APP_URL, APP_ENV and APP_FORCE_URL. Whenever I switch APP_URL to https, the site becomes inaccessible with an SSL error.
 Here are the configs: https://pastebin.com/Qccwu1LN
 As an aside, I poked around the Apache configs in the Docker container and was curious to see that there is no SSL conf in sites-enabled. There is a config in sites-available, but I think that the path to the SSL certs is wrong. Could this be causing the issue?
 It feels like, "it just works" for most people here, but for whatever reason, I have had nothing but problems configuring SSL. (HTTP works fine.)

 Mount each raspberry pi onto eachother via an rclone sftp mount.
 on each raspi settup jellyfin to read from the remote raspi drives and their own local drive.
 Now each raspberry pi is connected to eachother and each person with a raspberry pi can play media from it.
 But now let’s say I would want to add a 4th raspi remotely. Since each person lives separately what would be a good way to make it to auto-connect a 4th raspi?

 I found recently the Flame dashboard and really liked the look. I had no experience in customizing such things, but found out how to do it myself and am happy to share. Hopefully it will be helpful for someone out there! :)
 I know it's not a big deal, however, I am still happy about this achievement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering if anyone else is using this method. I just got my Pixel 1 in from ebay.
 I plan to keep and host all family videos / photos on my server, and have backups on and off site of that server. 
 Planning on using something like syncthing to get pics from our phones to the pixel, and then from the pixel to our "family" google account.
 Questions:
  
What is the best way to get pictures from our phones (android and iphone) to my server? Syncthing? Some other app im not thinking of?
 
Is it really unlimited full res for the life of the phone? I used the "reduced quality" for a long time and was never disappointed with the quality of the pictures saved - should I just use that to not piss google off?
 
Any other tips to get this to work flawlessly? (auto delete from phone after it uploads to google, etc)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got one of those BF deals for a big external HDD. Inside the outer Amazon box was the inner manufacturer box, but that was actually loose inside of the outer box. HDD itself seemed well packed / protected inside of the Manufacturer box though. 
 I documented the way it arrived and ran the an extended SMART driver test using the Manufacturer's utility. Took a couple of days due to size of the drive, but passed with no issues. Ran a few short tests with the same results. 
 So my question for my fellow Datahorders is what would you do? Return the drive and hope replacement is packed better or be satisfied with inner box protection + testing? Just curious.

 I tried going to the dashboard and doing Quick Sync, but it uses ./galleries/ which I can't find on my piwigo instance using the shell and when I try to add /gallery as a site it says the directory doesn't exist.
 If there's any other better way to sync my gallery with piwigo I would love to hear it, I'm using Android.
 I did try to use photoprism and lychee too but they didn't play well with syncthing and I didn't find any free ways to sync my gallery with either of them
 ​
 This is my docker compose for both syncthing and piwigo
 Edit: I checked with the entire file system and just had to route the shared folder of syncthing and piwigo to /gallery/galleries in the piwigo instance

 I have a music library that measures 59.7gb on my windows 10 laptop SSD. When I have transferred my library to my android phone it suddenly measures 63.97gb (when viewed via the phone's file explorer) and 59.8gb (when the phone is connected by usb and viewed via windows file explorer).
 ​
 Is this normal? Is it just due to differences in the filesystem or formatting or something? I tried searching around a little but I'm struggling to find a solid answer on this and would appreciate some assistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all.
 ​
 I have a NAS in a SilverStone DS380 (8-hotswap bay) along with some external USB 3.0 disk enclosures, making a total of 12x10TB but the pool is starting to get full and I am thinking of adding 4x20TB in short-term (Q1 2023) getting to 12x20TB in the mid-term (Q4 2024).
 ​
 SilverStone DS380 8-bay
 I do not have space for jumping to a rack solution (which is always on my mind and I will do for sure once i move home) so I need to stick in the meantime with tower-based NAS/DAS solutions. The ideal case would be the 12-bay Synology model of the pic, with the possibility to daisy-chain another 12-bay model to it, but I cannot ID it or find a non-rack alternative.
 ​
 ​
 Synology DS 12-bay
 ​
 Basically, I am trying to find a tower-size 8-bay (minimum) to 12-bay (preferable) DAS (no need to be hot-swap) with USB connection to attach it to my DS380 NAS until I move to a real rack solution (early 2025). 
 ​
 I have found some solutions from Orico, Mediasonic, Fantec, OWC, Sabrent... but I read a lot of connectionand cooling issues from this solutions I need to avoid as my system is on 24/7 as a backup and media server to 4 users. Plus I find them too overpriced for just a steel case with trayless bays ($50?), 150w low-efficiency PSU ($30?) and a bunch of SATA to USB adapters ($15?).
 ​
 ​
 Mediasonic 8-bay
 ​
 The best option I manage is another DS380 as a JBOD DAS, with a 300W gold SFX PSU, a pair of SSF-8088 connectors and SFF-8087 cables, but I would need to adress the dual-PSU synchronism with a Supermicro JBOD power control board for example and I would need to buy a JBOD card on my main system with external SSF-8088 connectors.
 ​
 Any thoughts on this? I live in Europe so the available solutions may be reduced.
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Reddit! (Sorry for my english)
 I'm looking for a simple self-hosted Forms Builder with a really important feature. It should have an option to prefill some fields using attributes from URL
 I have an example - https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 So if i'll use link http://myip:5200/form/gdR6dx?field1=text1 I'll get prefilled field "field1" with "text1"
 I guess you've got the idea. But this APP is buggy and is not really supported how I can see. So I'm looking for another one with same feature
 Also https://forms.yandex.com/ provide the same feature, but it's not a self-hosted app
 https://cloud.yandex.com/en-ru/docs/forms/pre-fill
 I checked a few posts with same topic but didn't find exactly what I'm looking for
 Apps which I already tried:
 https://github.com/ohmyform/ohmyform
 https://github.com/Budibase
 https://github.com/formio/formio
 Thanks for your help!

 I'm working on a open source self-hosted dashboard that has the following core functionalities: hardware monitoring and file storage/management. My goal is to make it as minimalistic and user friendly as possible. The current name I have in mind is X-Panel. I'm looking for suggestions for a good name and some more features for this web app. I want a name that is easy to remember and accurately reflects the functionality of the web app. Any suggestions or ideas for improving the current name or coming up with a new one would be greatly appreciated! I have also added some screenshots of the web interface.
 Thanks in advance for any help.

Seafile seems ideal, but heard some critique regarding the way files are stored and issues that could happen if something happens to the database. 
 We all use Apple devices, so syncthing is not so good either as their iOS app is really awful. 
 Nextcloud feels very sluggish and OwnCloud Infinite Scale is very young with not lots of documentation (not even sure it has server side encryption).
 Any recommendations on that matter? Thanks!

 As you know Google will start to delete files on in-active accounts starting from January 2023. I was wondering if there is a tool that can login to the account and do some activity so the 2 year policy resets? A simple one to ping the google services like gdrive gmail or other g services so that the inactivity timer resets?
 https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/10214036#activity 
 A plugin or a tool that can create and delete a folder on gdrive every 30 days and keeps a track record for example will do the magic I think.
 Thank you

 The story starts in 2016 when I bought my first RAID controller and drives to build my first storage server. Being of young age and with limited means, I opted to cheap out on the controller and buy the (as I later figured out) awful HighPoint Rocketraid 840A, then going for about $300. Compared with an LSI card with 16 ports, that was approximately a third of the price when buying new (Stupid me didn't even consider buying used). Of course, it later turns out that the hardware RAID6 capabilities I bought the card for are not even present, but that is another story for another day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 on recommandation of : u/halbzu
 I will post my question here.
 Hello niece and nephews, its testlab01 with a new question and advise needed.
 I want to buy as in the TS says an NAS. a 4bay nas to have it in RAID-5 for fail over. The reason for this is because we are running out of cloud storage on my device as my families devices. Google etc, and when i want to expand the cloud storage i need to pay a lot for something what is not mines. And if i dont pay anymore i still need to store all the files to something local. So in this case an NAS would be the best solution.
 So i know only two brands Synology the number(1) famous NAS brand, and QNAP what is more for professionals i think. My preference self goes to Synology because the software DSM.
 But i am still not really convinced which one to buy. In my shopping cart (eBay) i have added DS920+ and 4x 2tb IronWolf ST4000VN006 in total i will have 12TB of storage with fail over of 1 disk of 4tb.
 In the meantime 923+ came out in November 2022 and is a upgrade compared to the ds920+Pro"s- 2.5gbps Ethernet port.- upgrade to 16gb ram, not official only upgrade to 8gb with an extra so-dimm 4GB.- new CPU AMD this time (but no GPU processing power, so PLEX will not be the great solution)- now you can have nvme storage pools.
 I am not a big watcher because of work (not that much time) but it would be always good when i have time to watch something without problems.
 My budget is about 800€ less is always better, i have a voucher of 300€ discount so from 966€ will be like 699€ what a good price is for NAS + storage 16GB.
 still to take the 923+ that one is more expensive as well. But getting longer updates as well, or to stay with the 920+ + or even a QNAP to take?
 building a NAS etc, will not be the choice because it will never give you all the bells an whisels what you get with an NAS.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in a 2 bedroom flat. No basements, or other suitable places for a server cabinet. I also can't run ethernet cables without drilling lots of holes everywhere. The ISP's coax cable enters the flat on the corner of the living room so all the wired stuff has to live within immediate vicinity of it. 
 That means I have to be very careful picking equipment - everything has to be quiet and not very hideous. Enter, my homelab:
 Not too ugly, no?
 The loudest piece here is the big NAS. Everything else is completely silent. The NAS has 12 hard disks generating a noticeable, persistent buzzing sound. Thankfully, it's only audible if the room is entirely silent. If there is anything on the TV I can't hear it at all.
 On the wireless side, most devices are on the TP-Link AP. It supports VLANs and has decent coverage. The Netgear AP only exists to deliver as fast a connection as possible to my desktop PC on the other side of the flat. More on that here.
 Overall, this is what the network map looks like:

 I plan on adding 5G cellular backup at some point, but overall I'm pretty happy with this setup!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR;
 I'm torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability/recoverability. Hence I am looking for some (long-term) experiences from people who have tried or are using SeaweedFS.
 Full story;
 I have been following SeaweedFS for quite some time and I loved it initially, however, as time progresses and I learned more about it I got a bit worried about its recoverability.
 I tested it locally and had some issues with it, but those were mainly due to my own lack of knowledge with regards to SeaweedFS and Linux. My failures are what made me initially doubt the recoverability potential of the software since I did have data-loss during my tests. Luckily it was only test-data.
 When you initially start reading about SeaweedFS it sounds really easy to set up and get started with, and it is, but there are so many things to be aware of when using it "in production" that are not always clear in the beginning. For example: The Filer *IS* a single point of failure if you don't back it up (even though the GitHub page states that there is no single point of failure). Or that it's best to use config files instead of cli parameters when running in production.
 On the other hand, if you know you need to keep these things in mind, then it doesn't really form an issue.
 I'm really torn between wanting to use SeaweedFS and worrying about data availability and recoverability, and I'm looking for some experiences from people that have tried it are using SeaweedFS, especially long-term use.

 Lemme list a couple of things I "discovered" by myself:
 - miniflux - the best self-hosted rss ever. fast (due to spartan UI), yet extensible via customized CSS and tons of extensions. Integrates nicely with Mac's Reeder and Reeder app on iOS (which is an essence of brilliant UX/UI for me).
 - kanboard - extremely simple kanban board, still so powerful and elegant. An essence of extreme usefulness combined with almost no UI.
 - flame - a simple dashboard. Hell, I wish I found it before - it would save me a lot of time setting up my family's bookmarks. Being able to see different set of bookmarks depending on whether you're "signed-in" or not was the game changer for me.
 - metube - best tool to fetch YouTube music to feed your AzuraCast home radio

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short I have been trying to put together documentation together or more so a large list of items related to my self hosting setup, important personal information(not particular to self hosting) and resources for the items. This was originally brought up by my brother since my family more or less relies on alot of my self hosted items and would not know what to do if I "got hit by a bus". I'm calling this my doomsday drive, as I'm hoping to store this in a safe at my parents home and potentially safe within my home.
 ​
 I'm curious if anyone has any templates out there or has any ideas for this. My documentation has by no means been good and I'm trying to get better and by adding items into my notion.so account (not self hosted, may get smite'd for this).
 ​
 Edit:
 Taking all the feedback I received this is the plan I'm going with:
  
Moving from LastPass over to Bitwarden (this has been on my mind for awhile but this gave me the momentum to go through with it).
 Using https://github.com/potatoqualitee/eol-dr provided from u/felipefideli as a template for accounts and just general personal info that will be stored within Bitwarden.
 Continuing documentation and building a static website for the documentation with instructions of how to spin up the container as well as a copy of it so it can be ran on a rasp pi which will be stored in my parents safe. Will also be writing these in text(markdown) files as well, will be encrypted as well.
 Recovery codes are going to be stored within bitwarden as well as physical copies stored at my bank and at my parents safe, this is only in case something were to happen to my phone as my fiancé knows how to access it. 
 Currently in the process of learning Ansible and setting up AWX so if something fails in the short term (like NVR) I will have templates to easily fix it.
 Continuing teaching my brother my environment.

It has 4x M520 blades which have nice specs, but admittedly are a bit older on LGA1356 with DDR3 and I'm looking to replace the blades. I started looking into Dell's technical guidance and found where it lists M520, 620, 630, 640, 820, 830 blades as options. I found some options on ebay which are listed as PowerEdge M630 through their service tags. Looking at my blades service tags they are reported as: PowerEdge M520 (for PE VRTX). 
 I don't know a lot about these VRTX Chassis other than they have some special connectivity and PCIe sharing options. That being said, is there a difference between a normal M630 blade (say from a m1000E chassis) and the M520 from the VRTX?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 Planning on making my first homelab and need some advise.
 Got an Fujitsu FUTRO S920 as router due to this video. Got an NAS which will get RTL8125B nic in either 2.5 or 10 gb. But don't know what NIC to get for my router without breaking the bank, and ofc a good switch behind the router to plug all the devices in. My pc asus mobo already got 2.5 but could a RTL8125B nic in there aswell if needed. 
 ISP currently delivers 500mbit download so could I cheap out and use 1gb ethernet port on the thinclient? Single nic's are much cheaper and easier to find than double. 
 BTW: I'm thinking of running OpenWrt on the thinclouter/router.
 Would appreciate some suggestion and or tips :)

 I know there is a firewall feature on some Supermicro servers but tech support answer was it doesn't work because no one is using it.
 Having it exposed to net is a no go. But if I go with some VPN device I will need to pay for another U.

 I see that docker allows you to set the ip for docker's internal networks, but is it possible to be done this way? It is similar to Virtualbox/vmware bridged connection compared to NAT.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Dell PowerEdge T330 that I am running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy) on, and of course Dell in their standard lack of consideration for Linux users by dragging their feet on updating the ISM software to support current versions, so I decided to research and figure out how to get it installed onto the system myself. Versions given in example are current as of when I did the installation. 
 And now, on to the instructions!
  
Download & install libssl1.1:
  
​
 cd ~ && wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb sudo dpkg -i libssl1.1_1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.16_amd64.deb wget https://dl.dell.com/FOLDER08657945M/1/OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00.tar.gz tar -xvzf OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00.tar.gz --one-top-level 
  
Edit the Installation Script:
  
​
 nano ./OM-iSM-Dell-Web-LX-4300-2781_A00/setup.sh 
  
Change setup.sh line 294 from 20 to 22, and save file:
  
​
 if [ "$OS" == "Ubuntu" ] && [ "$VER" == "22" ]; then 
  
Finally, run the setup script, I went ahead and selected 10 (install everything):
  
​
 sudo bash setup.sh

 **Please note, this requires you to install libssl1.1, which has been depreciated on 22.04 and you must download it from a previous version repository.

 What I basically want to do is to setup a Kubernetes Cluster able to manage some services I want to publish online.
 Virtualisation would be preferred because I don't want to setup 3+ Machines to run K3S on it when I can do it on only one physical machine (well my wife probably would kill me if I but 3 more machines)
 If you go for a complete Server Build: what would you recommend? (I will probably Build it from scratch since I don't have the money to buy it at once)
 If it's a consumer build? What CPU and Mainboard do you recommend? (Power Consumption should not be high!)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I generally lurk and rarely posts here.
 ​
 I saw the Western Digital sale post during Black Friday for the Red Pro NAS drives so I jumped on the chance. Bought 2, and then realized I needed more so bought 2 more. The first 2 drives came perfectly fine, passed SMART and had no problems with stress tests. 
 The second batch had huge problems. One, they delivered only ONE drive instead of the two I ordered. Next, the one drive that did arrive was dead on arrival. SMART wasn't even working when I plugged it in. So I tried RMAing it, but that requires registering it. So I tried registering the drive and lo and behold, I get
 "Sorry! Product registration failed, please try later. (STATCODE108)" 
 Customer support is just running me around the ringer. They keep promising me updates with no updates given after their promised deadline of "24-48 hours." I have gone through both their chat system, garnering me the generic
 ("Please allow me to inform you that your issue has already been forwarde to our team and they are looking iinto the issue.")
 and calls - what else can I do? 
 I registered the previous 2 drives just fine. All drives were bought directly from the WD online store.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I have a home server where I run all of these lovely services we like to use in this community. This server happens to be pretty near my TV. And even though I do access some of these over the network I always thought that it would be nice to have some graphic interface on the server and access it just by plugin a HDMI to the TV. I'm with a shameless Ubuntu server 20.04 without X nor any windows server and all of the services with Podman.
 I'd like to keep my host clean, so the idea would be to run either a full os with vagrant or something similar or just run a container with the X server installed and some devices mounted. I don't necessarily want to run a whole wm nor anything similar, I guess I will mostly use it to run regular desktop apps or even just a browser.
 Does it makes sense ? Is any of you doing anything similar ?

 So is there any way (that I'm missing) to set Asus 4G-AC68U to bridge mode, so RT-AC68U router sees internet and acts as sole router?

 Bonus question:
 Having OpenVPN server on router, and connecting from mobile (not in home WLAN) to router via VPN to access LAN from outside, how safe is it taken account that the phone isnt' lost.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First time posting, looking for advice on a first serious server build project. I currently run a media server out of an old windows tower but it's just a full desktop that runs the media server on the side. I want to have a true server that does dedicated tasks. In this case run a Plex server and VM sandbox for professional development.
 I picked up an z820 for a deal and initially was looking to upgrade it to work as a media/sandbox learning server but I'm wondering if it's the best long term option.
 These are the stats of the hardware it came with and what I (pie in the sky) imaged to build it to:
 Hardware as I bought:
  
 CPU Intel Xeon E5-2630 V2 ST1AM 2.60Ghz MALAY J527C615 
  
 RAM 8 x 8GB PC3-14900R DDR3-1866MHz ECC REDG 240-Pin DIMM, 4 x 4GB PC3-14900R DDR3-1866MHz ECC REDG 240-Pin DIMM 
  Disk Space 2 x 120 GB SSD 
  Motherboard HP Dual LGA2011 16 RAM memory slots, SAS & SATA connections REV: 1.03 
  Graphics Card NVIDIA Quadro K600 1GB DDR3 
  PCIe Cards included NVIDIA TESLA K40, Siemens PETLink Stream Buffer Model: 10251412 
 
 ​
 Ideal Build:
  
 CPU Intel Xeon E5-2697 v2 x2 
  
 RAM 128GB DDR3 RECC 
  Disk Space 8 x 8TB SAS drive (RAID 10 to maximize performance and fail tolerance) 
  Graphics Card Nvidia GeForce 2080ti 
 
 -Ability to extend storage to a JBOD enclosure
 With all that said. I'm wondering if, for the sake of a long term build, I should just sell it for parts and look for an r720/r720xd to fill it in with less overall footprint? Or is there a better option to consider?

 i currently have a DELL T7910 with
  
Dual Xeon 2640v4 (10c 20t)
 128Gb ram
 Nvidia M2000
 4x 512GB Nvme's in a Dell Ultra-Speed Drive Quad NVMe M.2 PCIe card
 2x 3TB Ironwolfs
 2x 6TB WD Reds
  
as my home server / Lab.
 I am thinking about selling it and change for something that consumes a bit less power then this setup, currently is consuming about 160w idle.
 I was thinking in changing it for a couple of DELL Optiplex 3060 with i5-8500T 32GB ram, both of them would run proxmox, with 4/5 VM's on them.
 One would be more dedicated to media the other more for learning. the VM's that i would run are some linux server, with docker containers and a windows server acting as a Domain controler.
 Do you guys think that it would be a good change or not?
 Thanks in advance.

 My idea was to run my current linux.iso server with the NAS mounted in NFS4.1 and just smack all the sweet linux iso's right onto there.
 Quickly realized I'm getting bottlenecked bigtime, despite running the newest storage tech in RAID 0 for double the speed etc (I kid, don't hurt me). I know Raid0 is stupid but I'll take any performance wins as this will only host data I don't care about losing - not much of a data hoarder, eh.
 Anyways I'm getting cache overloaded to infinity and beyond.

Currently, we use RealVNC but I have been thinking about replacing that with Tailscale and Apache Guacamole. I like the idea of a clientless solution for remote access.
 In terms of the Guacamole server, I was wondering if it would work to use a small Google Compute instance, install tailscale and the guacamole server on that, and then install tailscale on the various workstations and connect them all up. The users would login to the Guacamole server running on the google compute platform and then from there access their machines. 
 If this works, then since this instance of Guacamole would be public facing, I would enable the 2FA plugin. Any other security recommendations? Reverse proxy?
 Any thoughts, suggestions, concerns are welcome. Thanks in advance.

 I'm just starting to become a datahoarder and picked up a Synology NAS. My main motivation was the huge collection of tutorials and other knowledge I've saved on YouTube that may up and disappear one day.
 First Goal: I'm looking for really simple no-code (or very low code - I code all day long, and don't want to have to write/maintain a bunch of this stuff too) way to automatically archive anything I add to a specific YouTube playlist to my Synology NAS. I'd ideally like it to save thumbnails and descriptions as well.
 Second Goal: Some sort of easy interface for browsing, searching, and watching those archived videos, so I'm not just using crummy Windows search to try and find a video in the future.
 Does anyone have suggestions that can address 1 or 2, or both?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have multiple enterprise-grade rack mount servers with SAS RAID controllers (such as PERC H710, and P440). I'm just adding this to emphasize that I already have the hardware, and all controllers have a decent sized BBU-backed cache.
 The vast majority of the data is stored on Kingston DC series SSDs.
 Recently, I have heard multiple opinions saying that using hardware RAID with non-SAS drives has no benefits.
 Reasons in a nutshell:
  
SAS drives have(/had?) 520 byte sectors, so that they can store an 8-byte checksum alongside the 512-byte sector, with SSD drives lacking that, the controller doesn't have a reliable way to detect issues
 most controllers don't use SMART data to predict SSD failure
 it's more difficult to monitor drive failures if the controller hides the physical drives from the OS)
 moderately modern CPUs have no difficulty calculating parity, even at high IO load, and high speeds
  
What do you think? Are there any benefits to using a hard RAID as opposed to switching the controller to HBA mode and configuring soft RAID provided by the OS (be it MD/LVM in Linux, or Windows with the classic, drive-level RAID or Storage Spaces)?

 I did read different opinions... Someone say to store it powered off in an antistatic bag and wrapped in pluriball. Others instead say that having it powered off corrupt faster the data and also the lubricant on the moving parts dries out so that when you power it on again it will put the drive under extreme friction.
 I have not enough knowledge about this to take a decision on my own so I'm here asking for help. 
 Also any other advice will be welcome (such as what to choose when formatting it or anything else that I might not know)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker first time posting. Also English is not my first Language so please bear with me. I currently have Synology NAS with 2 bays with 2 4TB hard drives. I want to expand because I'm quickly approaching 7TB. I have my previous desktop computer that has about 8 drive bays that I would like to expand over time. I would like to get some opinions from the experts before I begin throwing time and money at this project.
 What OS/software should I use to manage/initialize my NAS? -- so far I have heard of TrueNAS, FreeNAS, ZFS and Unraid. Note:not even sure if I know what i am talking about here or if there are differences i am not aware of.
 Is expanding my "pools" for future additional drives going to be an issue? I don't want to be moving around several TB.
 I also read that my drives would have to be matching in size or I won't be able to use the drive to their fullest extent. I was thinking about going to 12-14 TB drives right away but maybe I should by smaller capacity drives to start out? It just seems that in the future my lower capacity drives with hold me back.
 Thoughts about backups - just looking for some suggestions? I read about snapshots but I'm not sure that applies here. I am familiar with the 3-2-1 rule but with the TB amounts of data I have I can't reasonably buy duplicates of all drives just to have 1 to 1 backups (if that makes sense) but maybe there is no way around this.
 I started off my journey with my synology NAS just to see if it would work and now that I have become a little more serious about my data-hoarding I would like a better setup with more storage as well as implement best practices. I see this as the next logical step before I get something that is rack mounted. Let me know all of your thoughts as I am sure I have missed something or have not thought a position through. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 As I frequently see interesting threads on Reddit, and I want to get them offline to 1) find them again easily, and 2) preserve them in case messages get removed, I made myself some time ago a Python script to "download" threads off Reddit.This script does not only download the thread, but generates a nice HTML file, so it can be opened in a browser and the thread navigated around conveniently. Here is an example of such HTML file.
 Recently, I told myself it would be better to have a web frontend for that tooling, since I am sometimes on the go and do not have the script and/or the Python interpreter on my machine.
 This therefore led to RedditArchive, a Flask self-hosted app to archive and download Reddit threads (screenshots available in the README):https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver
 You can install it on a small server of yours, such as a Raspberry Pi or a VPS. Installations instructions are provided if you want to try it on.
 If you do not want to deal with the hassle of setting a web server up, worry not! I also made the original script available here:https://github.com/Ailothaen/RedditArchiver-standalone
 Do not hesitate to comment and make suggestions – I have ideas for further features, but that's probably for another time. 🦉

 For background, I am quite new to this. I am a photographer and have been using simple external hard drives to edit and view my photos from. A few months ago, I purchased a 10TB WD Elements desktop hard drive, and the pursuit of having faster read/write speeds (without using SSDs) and joining this subreddit has only heightened that "passion" (or addiction?).
 I recently acquired 2x WD Gold 12TB and I have them in the OWC Gemini Dual Thunderbolt 3 enclosure. I have a large amount of photos in which I'd like to use the two drives to store and edit from (I have the appropriate backup system just in case). I would have never thought to go the Raid 0 route but this subred…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently using feedme on Android to follow and download a couple of feeds. It 'just' uses Feedly (free). 
 As I have a server running, I was wondering what advantage freshrss or others could have, but it was surprisingly hard to find comparisons. Maybe completely overlooked? Is there some features that I'm not seeing yet?
 I could think of privacy and unlimited number of feeds / articles. What else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know I'm late to the game, but I just tried this couple of tools and I really love them. 
 PiHole is super convenient to:
 - prevent _some_ advertisement on websites
 - it can also offer an interface in front of DNSMasq
 - and can also work as DHCP server.
 If you use the DHCP feature, you can associate each DNS request to an hostiname, in case you're curious to know which website you're wife is browsing ;) 
 I wanted to use the raspberry as VPN server and I tried WireguardEasy, it's a nice project but could not make PiHole to answer to the DNS requests coming from Wireguard running as docker. 
 Then I tried PiVpn, the installation took just few seconds and automatically recognize I had PiHole installed, configuring it to listed on the VPN interface. 
 Overall took me a few hours to find the right tool, but if you read this post you can just install PiHole and PiVPN in just a minute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I'm at the beginning of my homelab journey. I have Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and I have started with some docker containers there. I would like to make step forward and begin with virtualization (experiment with pfsense, networking, guacamole, AD, docker, maybe build small NAS). We rent small flat with my girlfriend and we don't have enough place for rack mounted server or even tower server (She said that 😅). I have an idea to buy PC and use it as first server, and I look for advice.
 My requirements:
 - small and silent,
 - not expensive in reference to power consumption,
 - able to run about 3-5 virtual machines simultaneously and some docker containers,
 - allow to build NAS with that. 
 Options which I found, all of them fulfill requirements of size to my flat (sorted from the cheapest one):
 1. HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Tiny i7-6700T (4x2,8-3,6GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 16GB 512GB SSD SATA - only 16GB of RAM and probably need to update from 2x8GB to 2x16GB in the future.
 2. HP Z240 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 480GB SSD SATA
 3. Dell OptiPlex 7040 SFF i7-6700 (4x3,4-4,0GHz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 500GB SSD NVMe <- think that it would be the most suitable, but I could be wrong :)
 4. DELL PRECISION T3420 Xeon E3-1240 v5 (4x3,6-3,9Ghz / 8 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD NVMe Nvidia Quadro K1200 - unnecessary graphic's card - I think, but Xeon on board.
 5. HP Z2 MINI G3 Xeon E3-1225 v5 (4x3,3-3,7GHz / 4 threads / 8MB) 32GB 256GB SSD PCIe Nvidia Quadro M620 2GB GFX - again, unnecessary graphic's card, but I really like design :) 
 Thank you in advance :)

 www.name.com, or https://name.com, or just name.com
 i get "https://www.name.com"
 How do i get rid of that additional "www."?
 Edit: its just a simple apache2 server, no reverse proxy. Edit 2 : on the porkbun dns site, when you add a record, it asks you to put something in the "host" field. I typed www in there, because i have seen this working on other sites. Now i left the field empty and it worked.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I spent my last weekend completely on tagging my music collection on my NAS. Scanning folder by folder with the Mp3tag software and giving it the correct album information one by one.
 Today I was adding the complete library in Plex... The outcome was not as expected... I have far more albums in Plex than folders on my NAS. In Plex, I see some albums multiple times, each with only two or three numbers of that album.
 I tried in Navidrome but that was even worse...
 What am I doing wrong? Is the tagging done wrong? Is there a better server solution?
 Thanks!

I also use a Synology NAS and utilize Nginx Proxy Manager to reach them outside my home. My question is, does it matter which server (host) I put my NPM on? Or should I separate it from my main cloud services host? I have two other available servers (hosts) but didn’t know what would be the best set up. I don’t want to affect the cloud server’s (Host’s) Nic…if that is even a thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I would really love to use Cloudflare Tunnel for usecases where a VPN isn't possible. E.g. usage via company notebook.
 The great thing is the possibility to secure it directly via Cloudflare with Two-Factor Authentication, so any request must past Cloudflare Auth before getting to my private NGINX. For me much more secure when opening ports directly.
 However, as Cloudflare is generating the HTTPS certificate, they can as Man in the Middle read my traffic (passwords, data, etc) in plain text. Right?
 So is there any possibility to use Cloudflare Tunnel but to secure my data so it cannot be encrypted via Cloudflare?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 TLDR : i'm looking for an image gallery capable of precise geotagging, and showing it on a map at very little scale (~500m²).
 Full version : I'm in the team of an outdoor event, and each year we take a lot of technical pictures (where a thing is plugged, did we installed a trash here or here, where the hell water distribution was routed, etc.). Those images are invaluable for planning and correcting errors the next year, because plans rarely adapt to the reality, and details evolve organically.
 Generally, we have 700-1000 pictures, from diverse sources. It's complicated when all you have is a big folder to search in.
 So, i'm looking for a selfhosted app where you can geotag a photo, and show it on a map very close, showing roughly 500m² of terrain or less. Ideally an orientation indicator would be useful. A good point would be filtering the points/pictures by tags on the map. For tagging, OpenStreetMap is exact where we are, because of micro-mapping and high precision points, and all that matters is relative positioning anyway.
 I'm already testing apps, but what i want is never a selling point. Map view are often limited to a low zoom, or the pictures shown in full instead of points. Basically i need to install every single one listed on the big list, and it's not an efficient process, when i can ask for help here too ! ;)
 Thanks !

 I tried to take a different approach them other guides out there by focusing more on using config as code practices and automating much of the install using ansible and terraform.
 The previous parts of the series focus on installing vmware vsphere 8 and using terraform to create all the virtual machines that kubernetes gets installed on.
 I have been using this process over the last year or two for my own homelab cluster so figured I'd clean up my notes, create a blog, and see if anyone else finds it helpful.
 Let me know what you think so I can try to make the content better.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I'm a college student studying IT, and I'd like to build a home server since I currently just have a laptop I use for school. I haven't completely decided all the things I'd like to host on this server, but I know at the very least I'd like to use it as a 24/7 Jellfyin/multimedia server and NAS, along with the capability to run other VMs and containers. The OS would be Unraid or another Linux distro.
 I also want it to be small and as power efficient as possible. Here's my current parts list for this build:
  
CPU: Intel Core i3-12100 ($124)
 CPU Heatsink: Noctua NH-L9i-17xx ($45)
 Mobo: ASRock B660M-ITX/AC ($120)
 Memory: G.SKILL Ripjaws V Series 32GB (2 x 16GB) DDR4 RAM ($80)
 Boot Drive: SAMSUNG 970 EVO PLUS M.2 2280 500GB ($67)
 Storage: 3x WD Red 4TB NAS ($210)
 Case: Fractal Design Node 304 ($99)
 PSU: FSP 450W Mini ITX Solution ($80)
  
This is the first computer I've built as a server (rather than for gaming), so any thoughts/suggestions are greatly appreciated. I'm also not against getting anything pre-built, so I'm happy to hear about any alternatives as well.

 ​
 I have already installed postfix configured as it indicates in the digital ocean tutorial I use smtp as I only send
 ​
 But now, how do I add a user who is the one who posts in my iposte.io as smtp relay and how to send all the emails that I have in my poste.io through the postfix of my vps
 ​
 What I need is a server equal to sendgrid, mailgun, etc. in my own vps. How do I protect and connect to my server in the vps?
 ​
 I have installed
 ​
 -----postfix
 -----libsasl2-2 sasl2-bin
 ​
 My user already creates my user but I cannot connect to my server with these led credentials I leave as I have my sudo nano /etc/postfix/main.cf

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am looking for a server that I can use to host and stream <2TB worth of videos, which may later expand to 4TB, but I doubt it may expand over that, these are the types of videos I have want that I want to stream.
  
one-on-one zoom consultations I've done
 
ripped youtube videos 
 
Videos ripped from online courses I've paid for
 
personal recorded videos recorded using my phone
 
 My idea is to have a dedicated media(video) library where I can have it all in one dashboard. Instead of having to open up multiple tabs or files (i.e. youtube, google chrome, etc.). 
 I don't want to host these videos on any cloud services (i.e. OneDrive, Google Drive, mega.nz, etc.). For fear thay my files/videos get flagged as copyright and my account suspended.
 I'd also like to have the ability to create embedded video links, to put onto my Personal Knowledge Management System (PKM System), which would most likely be a combination of Notion, OneNote and Nimbus Note.
 I already have a Synology NAS DS218+ that I use for cold storage back-up, but it's not suited to host media. I also don't want to have a NAS were I store sensitive files and at the same time open to the web with media hosting. I want these two things, physically compartmentalized.
 I will be the only dedicated-user of these media files being streamed, so there is no worry of bandwidth, when streaming video files.

 Most media servers let you quickly find something to watch, then you watch it in full on a chosen device. I wanted something else that was for browsing around and adding more granular metadata.
 I made a thing for digging around in your content and adding tags to specific moments. It has animated thumbnails and you can transcribe media that have no subtitles.

 I have been trying to decide what direction to take this in, but I have been struggling to find people to ask.

 I knew I was planning a new living room PC soon, and having it double as a NAS, so I kept it. I ordered another 16TB SAS drive and a SAS RAID controller a couple weeks ago to put the new computer together. I want to make a basic RAID 1.
 Windows shows the controller as "Avago adapter sas3 3008 fury - StorPort" and says the driver is good, but I don't see any sign of the connected drives, or any UI to set up the controller.
 Are there any good guides for this? Any guides I've found assume SATA drives and either the RAID support on the motherboard or Windows virtual volumes -- and that you can actually see that the drives exist before you get started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, yeah, another "Debian vs. Ubuntu" thread. I'm asking because a lot of the threads I'm finding are many years old where I guess Ubuntu peeved some people and they moved away from them to Debian. I also know that people generally think Debian is more stable but, again, those threads were quite old. I don't really know if thats much the case anymore.
 Right now, I have a mix of Debian and Ubuntu containers in Proxmox but I want to standardize on one. I'm leaning towards Ubuntu Server for one reason: I have no idea why, but apt update and apt upgrade on my Debian containers is painfully slow. I mean, REALLY slow. I've tried everything and just can't figure out why.
 Another reason I'm leaning towards Ubuntu is because of commercial support. Obviously, I don't need commercial support at home but if we start migrating some services at work to Linux (which I think we may), I'm sure management would want to go with the distro that offers support. I'd prefer to use at work what I'm familiar with at home.
 Other than that, is there any other reason I should stick with Debian that I'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 I tend to find myself having weird 'me only' issues when hoarding. Im currently sat at over 1m images, from deviantart, pixiv, pinterest but then i discovered wallhaven.....you can see where this is going.
 Assuming you are using gallery-dl with the '--write-metadata' option to download an ID search or batch of single images it will check the json for the file for the username, create a folder structure and then sort the files for that user to the correct folder.
 it'll then add the user account to a txt file for batch downloading of that users uploads. Eventually, ill no doubt have all the user accounts (if they have uploaded) but i then use this for more downloads.
 As an example, i download all the images tagged for cyberpunk 2077 lets say around 300, this is parsed i then have 90 users ready to go and end up with 100k images after running that list. They state they only have about 1m images themselves so shouldn't take long to get it all then just append to my collection.
 I couldn't find a list of all users, a search all(*) or a list of how many IDs they have. But if you know, let me know. I could have just iterated over IDs in a loop 1 to 999999 but thats possibly a lot of waste.
 Anyway......
 As i say, this fits my need for how i scrape stuff from there but thought id share it should someone want to improve/make use of it. Its powershell btw

 My plex is hosted at: 192.168.1.2:32400 but kuma always states: 
 [Plex] [DOWN] Connect EHOSTUNREACH 192.168.1.2:32400
 Does anyone have any idea what I might be doing wrong? Plex is hosted on a windows server machine, and kuma is inside a docker container running inside an ubuntu server vm on the same device (vm's private ipv4 is 192.168.1.3) TIA.

 90+% of the blurays are LTH 25gb
 Would a 8TB be good enough to store all them? Since streaming is so abundant now and looks to be for the forseeable future unless something serious happened to the world ( nowadays who can say, would it be better to find them on the net when I want?
 Will an external HD be ok if written to and then only accessed when needed ( once or twice a month) and then shut off? 
 I am getting older and plan on retiring in next 10 years. I will have plenty of time to watch all my "classic" movies a that time. So I am wanting to store all this until I retire. Then my family can deal with it when I pass.... HAHA dont know what they are in for
 32TB so far not including blurays

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m struggling here.
 I’d like to run Nextcloud so that it syncs only when my iOS devices are either 1) locally connected to network or 2) VPN’d remotely.
 I don’t want to expose a public IP or use reverse proxy.
 VPN is setup and working properly on my router & router has ddns address.
 Nextcloud All-In-One docker is installed on Mint Linux box but during setup NC asks for domain and does not allow IP (why?)
 Now I’m stuck bc I dont have a public domain. I have a ddns IP from NoIP for the VPN but not sure this NoIP domain is what I want to use (along with router port forwarding) since its public facing.
 I think an option is to create a private domain via technitium’s zone and point the router to this DNS so that the iOS devices use the DNS but I’m not sure this will work when VPN’d.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After losing a couple SSD's the pain of losing my files was too great. I started doing some research and bought a TerraMaster D4-300 and two 12Tb HDD. I am unsure what would be the best next steps for backing up my files. 
 My initial strategy was to start backing up on one HDD 1 and then set up HDD 2 as a mirrored backup. Now that I have it all plugged in, I am unsure about the best way to do that and looking for advice. I am working from a 4TB Macbook Pro that will go back and forth to work with me and ideally, the TM will be a part of a desk/monitor set up I can just connect laptop to when working from home. 
 Something like drivepool seems perfect for what I need but I can see from other posts that's not an option for Mac. Should I just set up a ChronoSync task to mirror HDD 1 to HDD 2 and sync whenever I add files?
 I'm a noob at all this so any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

My one issue: the enclosure has a built in power save/sleep function that I cannot disable. Tried going through and making sure APM was disabled, spindown was disabled, etc, but after exhausting all resources I am fairly sure this is a function of the enclosure(even though it is not listed in the product info anywhere I can find). this causes extremely slow load times for Plex initially and can cause temporary hangups browsing files, etc. Anyone know of a good 3.5" enclosure that does not have a sleep function? I have been looking online and this was the best option that did not list powersave, and ended up having it anyway. Not ready to pull the trigger on an add-on board yet for the Pi. Thanks for any replies!

Anna’s Archive is active on the normal internet—no need for Tor—and has an “About” page that says: “This website was created by Anna, the person behind the Pirate Library Mirror, which is a backup of the Z-Library shadow library.” And I estimate that people with 300 terabytes of disk space have the ability to personally mirror the totality of the shadow-library material that exists—maybe that’s irrelevant, but the fact that people can personally mirror the totality of the content in question might make it harder to crack down on shadow libraries.

 ​
 I used to have a pentium 6500 ,12GB DDR4, 10TB HDD as my homeserver, sold it and for the last two years I used my gaming PC to complete these tasks;
 Plex, 2x Linux VM running in hyperv.
 ​
 I don't have a problem to be honest with this, apart from that I hate hearing the HDD noise next to me and the 3x ethernet cables it runs out. So I decided, I would like to have a little homeserver , again.
 This time, I looked around and I have seen that I only need Plex to be able to run (no transcoding, everything is in 1080p and my upload is 150mbit/s, only 2 people use it)
 The VMs are: DNS and webserver, both only run very little traffic.
 I would love to listen to suggestions, as Synology is horrible priced, I would like to keep this a super small form factor(HP Prodesk g4??? or mac mini (this would be my favourite tbh, but I don't like the fact that I would need to use USB for the 3.5 HDD) 
 Then, I have come across used Proliant gen9 servers. I mean, they seem to be percfect. Apart from that they are outdated, I could probably run proxmox or unraid on them, allocate cores and memory properly and completetly avoid using windows (this would be another big point for me) 
 Oh and my budget is maximum £250.(used or new) 
 On my previous, I ran Windows and I hated it, Windows for me is only for gaming.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, new on here and generally new to the whole self hosting thing apart from pihole.
 Currently I’m running just pihole and unbound on raspberry B+ (2014) model on dietpi. My goal is to be able to use it outside of my home network in the SAFEST way possible with least amount of lag possible.
 I would rather spend some extra time to achieve both (if possible) than to take a shortcut. I’ve heard about wireguard, Tailscale and zetotier but not looked deep enough to decide which one is the best approach of the three.
 What i was hoping to do was fresh install of everything on a new sd card for two reasons; in case things go south i still have copy of current setup on old card and secondly so that i can easily follow certain guide as its been a while since i setup the pihole. I have some extra questions i want to ask for future planning.
  
How many things can i run on this raspberry pi? In near future i want to try few other things I’ve come across such as bookmark manager like shiori or password manager like Bitwarden/vaultwarden2.
 if I can run more than just the pihole setup mentioned in second paragraph, whats the best approach? And how?
 Does it make sense to use flash drive (if possible) to run this on for extra reliability.
 say someone is able to access my pihole, aside from my dns queries what other data can they access
  
My ultimate goal for future would be to use pihole as primary dns and have everything else running on some server (post for another day)
 I would really appreciate any help you guys can provide. Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. A while ago I started building a solution for managing my projects. Even though I kind of have it working, I feel like there should be an existing solution for this that could be of more value for me. Here is my situation:
 I have a few machines running on my network, each of them runs some projects of mine. When I want to run a project, I log on to the machine, clone the repo and run a command to build and serve it.
 I develop and update projects from my main machine, and whenever I push an update I have to log on to the relevant machine and do the whole process manually over again.
 What I would like is to be able to upgrade, rebuild, and rerun the projects on each machine, from a central dashboard of some sort, eliminating the need to log on to each machine. Ideally I would like to hook this up with some git events so that the whole process is automated.
 I feel like there has to be some software that does this, that's not enterprise level. I was recently looking at portainer, which I think does what I want, but I don't have everything in containers so it doesn't work for me.
 ​
 Surely someone here has experience with this problem and can offer some advice!
 Thanks a lot in advance for any help.

I just purchased a second external HDD and am copying between the two and have hit 180+ mbs per second which I was not expecting.
 To add further confusion the new drive is plugged into my slower USB port which (they are both 3.0) ruled so by testing an external drive in each port on opposite sides of the laptop, this slower port gets 15 mb/s when transferring from my internal drive.
 Wondering what the bottleneck could be and if there's anything I can do.

The problem is I have no idea how to accomplish this. Ive been looking online saying I have to finalize the disks but we lost the Camera a long time ago. And the DVD player I have now is too big for the disk and it doesn’t reach the laser for it to be read. i’ve submitted some pictures for context. Links to products I could use and just advice in general would be much appreciated. I thank any and all who answer in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have 5 Raspberry Pis in my rack doing various things (Home Assistant, lighter Docker containers, reverse proxy, vpn, PiHole, etc.) and am thinking about swapping them out to a thin client or two. I want to try my hand with Proxmox as a hypervisor (possibly try my hands as a cluster).
 I have been doing a bit of research and found that the main contenders seem to be Lenovo ThinkCentre/ThinkStation, HP EliteDesk/Prodesk, and Dell Micro. The STH article that is getting passed around is a couple of years old and does not look to be updated with any newer recommended models.
 Do you all think that it would be worth swapping out most of my Raspberry Pis for a couple of thin clients? If so, what models should I be looking for? Mainly looking for a good balance between power and performance while being hopefully on the cheaper side. Again, I will hopefully be playing around with Proxmox as a cluster.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all - I'm just getting started in self-hosting and I've set up a homebrew calendar application in Django that used to be rent-hosted. So now I have it run on a old laptop in my office, and I use ddns.org for dynamic DNS. I'd like to start up a second service on the same machine, and access the original calendar service at a URL like myfake.ddnsdomain.org/calendar/ and the new notes-like service at myfake.ddnsdomain.org/notes/
 I tried using nginx to redirect the /calendar/ URL suffix from my HTTP port to a different port on which the Django app was running, and that worked for the initial page, but that same suffix was not appended the follow-up HTTP requests from the client side. How can I achieve this behavior without modifying the code for the calendar app? (Of course, I can technically do it for the calendar app, but then I wouldn't have a solution for the other services...)
 Is this possible? Or do I have to do something different, like should I do a 301 request to a different port and open multiple on my home router?

 I'm looking at either lorex or night owl.
 My question is if I have the nvr base in my rack, do my cameras need t9 connect directly to it or can I utilize existing wall Jack's? I know I'll need poe.
 My goal is an NVr box that can take ip cameras and wireless.
 I'm also open to non wyze suggestions lol.

 I currently have Synlogy DS214Play with two 4TB HDDs.
 I have a cctv software with one camera and plex installed, and they work great.
 Unfortunately Docker is not supported on DS214Play and I'm looking for some alternatives.
 My requirements are:
 - Network storage
 - Plex
 - Ability to install various packages, for example https://www.home-assistant.io/ or similar.
 - Ability to install a few CCTV cameras with CCTV management software. I would prefer something different than built-in synology software.
 Basically it would be nice if I could run everything on docker.
 What hardware do you recommend that is similar in physical size to synology boxes (can be synology). I don't have a space for a rack in my flat.

 I delete these filters because I am worried that by leaving them then only .png .gif .jpg .jpeg .css .js files will be downloaded and all the other files won't be downloaded, am I correct? 
 So I delete the filters and I leave the page blank, but what does happen when the page is left blank? I tried to use the filter +* to see if it is the same thing but then other files are downloaded if I leave the page blank and different files are downloaded if I use the +* filter.
 My question is what is downloaded when no filter is used?
 Another question, what's the difference between this filters:
 +*.png +*.gif +*.jpg +*.jpeg +*.css +*.js -ad.doubleclick.net/* -mime:application/foobar 
 and this filters:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know this topic comes up often but my situation is a little different. I have four servers total running in my rack and two of them are TrueNAS boxes. One is simply being used as a backup (replication) so I was wondering instead of running this server 24/7, why not power it off and have it turn on once a week, replicate and shutdown? Seems reasonable enough. 
 Any downsides other than not having replication running more often? At 325w being drawn at 0.33 cents is around $77 a month for me. I know my wattage is rookie numbers considering what others here are running.

 I received a stack of 19 Memorex DVDs from a relative to put them on a flash drive for Christmas. I've gone through 13 so far and 6 have come back with issues.
 In MakeMKV, all but one disc reported:
 Error 'Scsi error - MEDIUM ERROR:L-EC UNCORRECTABLE ERROR' occurred while reading
 The other disc had a different error I don't remember and haven't seen since. Some others were completely unreadable. Some discs were accessible through other means, but any video I could retrieve are severely corrupted so I'll have to copy a bunch of tapes as well to fill in the gaps.
 No discs had any visible damage. No bit rot no scratches. They've been untouched since 2005.
 I'm not asking for any advice, just recording my experience with these discs for others to reference and maybe kick their butt into gear to update their storage situation.

 Now I'd like to install quite a few services that usually run in a docker container like piHole/Adguard, Whoogle, TrueNas or similar for Storage, and maybe Yacht so that I am able to install more services easily.
 My question is, what is the best way to go to set these up? Should I use Proxmox LXC Containers, a designated linux vm in Proxmox or should I directly run the services as docker containers on the Proxmox Debian installation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was just reading the arch wiki on setting up RAID and it mentions it's highly recommended to partition the device used for RAID. But it doesn't really explain why. Could someone enlighten me please? Aside from the later suggestion of leaving 100 MiB on the end to make replacement easier is there a reason I should partition the drive before putting it into RAID?
 https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/RAID#Partition_the_devices
 Note: yesterday I did just this but using LVM. So I had 2 18TiB drives, I created 32 partitions about 0.5TiB each and then put them into an LV with total size 18TiB and RAID1 across each device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been struggling to self host SimpleLogin on my home server where my internet provider provided a public ip which is usually changed from time to time because I do not subscribe for the much higher price fixed public ip.
 simple-login/app: The SimpleLogin back-end (github.com) 
 I understand that the installation guide provided in the GITHUB link above is based on the self-host environment where the server has a permanent fixed public IP?
 I've installed it on the home server and added all the DNS records required on Cloudflare where I managed my registered domain. I can open up the SimpleLogin signup webui and the signup email verification was successfully sent to Yahoo by postfix (I know by looking at the /var/log/mail.log), but my yahoo inbox/spam box never got the mail. So I'm stuck. I suspect it has something to do with the system mail name, my domain, etc. that I setup for Postfix. 
 My internet provider doesn't block port 25, so it is not a port problem.
 My home servers:
 - PfSense box running HAProxy as a reversed proxy
 - Self-hosted SimpleLogin was installed on Debian VM (which runs on my Unraid server)
 - mydomainname.com was registered at Namecheap but I transferred the DNS management to Cloudflare. All subdomains set on Cloudflare DNS are working fine hand in hand with my pfSense HAProxy. 
 Any advice would be appreciated.

 A bit new to selfhosting - currently have a RPi4 running FreshRSS & NextcloudPi behind an nginx reverse proxy, all hosted in docker containers.
 I have a database of articles including a section and article link - there are a total of about ~10,000 articles in it. I would like to create an RSS feed that randomly picks up one article every day and sends it to FreshRSS, so I can read the articles on my phone/linux system. 
 Any information on how to do this easily is very much appreciated. Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. 
 I have a number of different small scripts to automate and integrate various tasks. I've used UnRaid's Custom User Scripts to host these over the past couple years. Things are starting to become unmanageable and I've starting looking into a more robust solution.
 At the end of the day, I'm looking for some application to run python scripts, manage environments, integrate with GitHub, and have some centralized scheduler. Things like logging, error notifications, or managing credentials would all be solid extras. 
 Most of the applications I've found seem overly complex, resource intensive, or just completely miss the mark. Things like JupyterHub, Jenkins, Airflow, VS Code Server, and others. 
 Airflow is probably the front runner, however it is still much, much more than what I'm really looking for. I feel like I'm searching the wrong keywords...
 Any recommendations?

Ideally, I get a pfSense/OPNSense router feeding the switch, but this will have to wait until I can source some well-priced hardware.
 Right now, I only have the router my ISP provided me with. Is it possible to connect a Cisco managed switch to an ISP router? I (at the moment) don't have any other way of providing IP addresses, other than this router which acts as an AP as well as DNS/DHCP server. 
 Total newbie - any advice is well received. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a dell r720 that I'm having issues setting up/booting.
 The system powers on when the power button is pressed and the front LCD panel says "System Booting" but there is no video output on either the front or back VGA ports. I have tested my VGA cable and monitor on my other r720 and it works. I have also done a NVRAM jumper reset to make sure the embedded video controller wasn't disabled. No error codes show on the LCD and their are no error beeps (unless those can be disabled). When the system finishes "booting" the front LCD displays the system name and all other menus properly. Not sure what the issue could be so I'm checking here to see if any of you have any ideas.
 ​
 EDIT: This system does not have the enterprise IDRAC license so I cannot confirm boot or enter the system through there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Recently I've been moving away from rackmount hardware to SFF machines to reduce my power usage, heat and noise.
 I've had some good success running Proxmox on HP EliteDesk SFF units and have been finding Intel AMT to be a suitable alternative to iLo/iDrac and am currently experimenting with MeshCommander/MeshCentral.
 On the HP site there is a firmware update tool for updating Intel AMT.However the included firmware is quite old and the tool is designed for either DOS/EFI.
 The newer firmware updates appear to be designed for Windows only.
 Is there a way to flash the Intel AMT firmware from within Linux IE Debian/Proxmox?If so, how I determine which firmware I need?
 The download from HP appears to include two bin files, C0_LP and D0_H.
 Thanks in advance for any help/advice.
 EDIT: I've more or less given up on the idea of doing this from within Linux for now and used this method:
  
I formatted a USB disk as fat32.
 Created a folder structure /efi/boot
 Placed the tianocore EFI shell in the boot folder named Boot64.efi https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/UDK2018/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64/Shell.efi
 From the HP flash tool download extracted with 7zip, copied the FWUpdLcl.efi and MEInfo.efifiles from the MEFlash and MEInfo directories to the USB disk.
 From the HP firmware download extracted with 7zip, copied both of the .bin files (H and LP) from the ME directory.
 Booted the machine from the USB Disk to get into an EFI shell
 Ran FS0: to change to the root of the USB disk (dir to check I'm in the right place)
 Ran MEInfo.efi to determine what firmware was running. In the output I saw I was running "H" rather than "LP".
 Ran FWUpdLcl.efi -f ME_11.8_Corporate_D0_H_Production.bin to flash the "H" firmware
 Rebooted and verified I was running the new AMT version with MeshCommander.

I see that there are multiple slots for hot swap SAS drives and a few for SAYA drives but I don't quite understand what type of drive I should be buying. I'm looking online and I see the HDD and sdd's however they don't have a mounting bracket. In my server I see there's a bunch of blanks. Am I supposed to fit the drives inside those? Also it it only SATA or ISCSI or something? Can someone explain this terminology for me? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Up until recently I’ve been running: - Synology NAS (Plex and NFS for other devices) - 3x Mac minis (2011) running Proxmox as a playground and to host a few services for the home - 1x Intel NUC (D54250WYKH i5-4250U) as a Home-Assistant box 
 This is great as a playground, but with the current cost of energy, I’m kind of wishing I had just ONE tiny/mini/micro system that could run Proxmox and then my same few VMs to replace the bare minimum of what I need.
 I’ve been reading up on the Serve The Home site and their great video series, and I’ve been considering:
  
Lenovo ThinkCentre M720Q (9th Gen Intel i5 9400T)
 HP EliteDesk 800 G4 
 Optiplex 3070
 Optiplex 7050
  
I DID try experimenting with two Raspberry Pi 4s I had, but they are just 2GB RAM models and I quickly ate that!
 So could anyone recommend a good bang-for-pound 😆 machine that I could pickup for around £200 used? Is it worthwhile to punt for the newer generation chipsets for power efficiency?

 Can anyone speak to the performance of either? I’ve heard that proxmox ceph suffers from high overhead and is borderline unusable. Sadly my node with the most compute power for virtualization is also the one with the most drive bays.

 I've recently been working on turning my old Desktop into my own home server and so far it's been going great, at least until I got stuck at creating new pools via TrueNAS Scale..
 I've got an 18tb and another 4tb hard drive and planned to use them in 2 pools:
 One Pool for RAID1, so I'd be using the entire 4tb drive and 4tb of the larger drive to create a pool where I keep my most important data and one using the rest of the 18tb drive as a regular data pool.
 ​
 However after creating the RAID1 Pool, I realized that I can no longer select my 18tb drive to add as a data vdev... could someone tell me how I can use the rest of my 18tb drive alongside RAID1 if that's possible?

I'd really like to host some services for my friends, though not all are web-based. I heard about Pomerium and am a little confused as to why people are using it in conjunction with Traefik. It seems to me that practically it is traefik for my k8-less uses but would allow for easier monitoring of who is using my services? I really like the idea of having to approve of each device on Pomerium before they can use any service of mine, and I'm not sure if that's possible with Authentik.
 If anyone has any knowledge they could enlighten me with here that would be cool! Does Traefik + Authentik work well for hosting a game server?

 I have an HP DL20 Gen9 which currently has two SATA SSDs installed.
 I'd like to upgrade to two NVMe SSDs installed on two PCIe to M.2 adapters like this one.
 The system doesn't seem to support PCIe bifurcation so I guess I should be fine by just using two separate adapters, right? 
 The system has one internal PCIe x16 slot which has a PCIe riser which splits that port into two PCIe x8 ports. Can I just install a PCIe to NVMe adapter in each of them? 
 Thank you!

 It’s a 14tb WD easystore from bestbuy I bought 12 months ago. I have a bunch of easystore boxes and the housing and stuff, but I don’t know which housing and box matches the one that died. Does that matter? Or can I just put any other housing and box on it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. Recently my mother's workplace has moved buildings. They found a better place, cleaner, where it already had furniture. I decided that, in hopes of finding something that I could use/learn from, I would go to the old place to tear through the remaining stuff in the office. The equipment was never registered properly and I was told there are no problems if I take them because of that. So I did, and I found some pretty interesting stuff. 
 I'm pretty new to homelabbing (not entirely new) but these were the first things I would get for free. 
 An HP switch, 48 ports, only 4 are GbE (2 RJ45+2 SFP)
 ​
 Cisco 881, FE ports only
 ​
 There's a VPN sticker on it. I suppose it was used for tunneling to the headquarters.
 ​
 8 Port GbE PoE switch. Pretty neat!
 Haven't booted this yet, unsure about specs, it just says SA4. I'll use this as the host for my CNC router since it has a LPT port on the back.
 This HP Compaq which - as you will see in the photo below - I called \"scrapyard\". Sorry for the lurking finger.
 ​
 I tried to install BSD but after flashing the USB it just wouldn't boot from the BIOS.
 I also got a lot of cat5e/cat6 wires. And one single mode fiber, too! (~5m)
 Overall I'd say I could find a use for these. Please let me know what you guys think!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/DataHoarder, first time long time.
 I have two hard drives I need some quick help with.
 Drive #1
 First is a Western Digital (I know) Red 3TB drive in my PR4100 NAS (I know, I know). Right now the software flags it but does not tell me why. When I check the SMART data via the NAS software, it seems to give me the same info for all 4 drives. (Clicking SMART on 2,3,4 all give the same numbers) This drive is under warranty, so I plan to buy a Seagate and use the RMA WD as a cold backup. But any info on how to get a SMART dump from that individual drive, or figure exactly why it's showing as bad, would be appreciated. This is my second WD drive to die within a year of purchase.
 Drive #2
 Second is a 4TB Western Digital (I know, I know, I know) Blue sitting inside my desktop. This one is giving me an Uncorrectable Sector Count. CrystalDisk just flags it as caution, but I'm not very familiar on the risk here. Also WD's software gives it a cleanbill of health. Should I just replace it, or is it fine for the time being? There is nothing really critical on that drive, so it's not a big problem if it just bites the dust out of the blue. But I would rather avoid it if possible.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just finished reading BRKSEC-2202 - Understanding and Preventing Layer 2 Attacks in IPv4 Network (2013). I learnt about attacks in layer 2 and ways to mitigate them.
 These attacks seems easy to perform, and also easy to mitigate (just enable things like DHCP snooping, Dynamic ARP inspection and IP source guard in your switch).
 Unfortunately, my current smart switch (Zyxel GS1900) does not offer these security features.
 Then again, these attacks require the malicious actor to be inside my network. They have to physically get into my house to do that (they can also brute force my wifi password or trick me to install some malicious software), and if that's the case then they can do much more than these "layer 2 attacks".
 Do you have these layer 2 security features at your homelab? Do you think they are essential to a secure homelab?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to set up cloudflare zero trust, so I can generate some traffic over it. I will be honest, I'm doing this just so I can get a code for yubikey, since I'm interested in a hardware 2FA key and how they work and this is a deal which I wouldn't want to miss. I know the deal is valid until the end of December, so I want to try to get the code. 
 So far, I applied for the offer, but I got an email saying right now, I'm not eligible. What I did meantime is:
  
Run a vaultwarden docker container on a laptop which has an IP 192.168.1.x and I can access it from other local devices.
 On zero cloud website under Access > Applications, I added the app, with a type "Private net" and application url is the IP above, allow rule for policies
 Created a tunnel under access > tunnels and run a connector on the same laptop where the docker is. Once it was run, status was connected on the website
 Next thing I did is I created a user under my team > users. Login method is one-time PIN which gets sent on the email.
 When I login, I type team domain I got from settings > general, it asks for email, sends the code, I type it in and it shows the app I created in the step two.
 The problem is, when I click the app, it redirects me to the IP 192.168.1.x as it's an application url, but only if I'm on the local WiFi. If I try the procedure from my mobile data, obviously it fails as it redirects to the mentioned IP
  
In both cases (WiFi and mobile data) it doesn't generate any traffic on cloudflare website at all as DNS requests, top logins by app are empty. So can someone tell me what I'm doing wrong or which step I'm missing?

However, s there a way to disable the history option? I found the cleanup parameters, but that doesn’t seem to be what I’m looking for. If there is no way, I can keep the parameters set to 1 day. Thank you for your help

 The drives arrived in good condition, correct packaging and sealed anti-static bags. Unfortunately, one of the bad serial numbers is from a DOA drive that needs to be exchanged. I will call support on Monday. I'm just interested if anyone else has experienced this from WD Store fulfilled drives. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I bought 20tb WD Elements HDD on Black Friday, run smartctl short & long test and used GSmartControl to view the results. All the stats seemed to be alright and the HDD passed the test. Except in the statistics tab, I found that the HDD had "Number of Mechanical Start Failures" value 29. I haven't found much info online and so I contacted WD support and they advised me to replace the HDD, which I did. Yesterday I (finally) received new HDD, and already, after running short test (not sure if I even had to run the test TBH), I am seeing that the NoMSF is 28.
 What the hell, I need to populate my media server!
 Should I replace it again, risk it, repair it (yeah, nah)? Does anyone have any similar experience, or knowledge that can help?
 ​
 Also. I have some crazy RAW values for 2 "unknown attributes", but I guess that's some proprietary WD thingie which GSC can't read?

 I just noticed I accidentally deleted almost all of my Logic sessions this week.
 To clean up my desktop I put everything in a folder, and by mistake I deleted that folder.
 I have some backups, but not of recent sessions and not of component files like drum kits.
 Please, give me all your suggestions for what I should do to go about recovering my life’s work. I have contacted a local data recovery service about an appointment. NYC area. 2016 MBP OS Catalina.
 This post may be slightly orthogonal to the subreddit but this is devastating to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everybody. I'm having as slight problem. I usually deploy my selfhosted app locally, but after some down time in some work critical apps (my isp sucks), i decided to go VPS route for those that i need high availability. The problem i came across is that now i have to use firewall to restrict access to ports i dont want to be access from the outside. Here comes the problem, I tried iptables, ufw, firewalld always worked fine till a restart, after that i found that docker overwirtes the rules and pass its rules first... 
 I found whalewall, and I get some success with it, but i ask myself, that is the best way to do it? Can some of you with more experience and knowledge about this give me a few directions for this simple situation.
 My objective is to pass most my docker apps through nginx proxy, with a exception of one or another.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use tailscale and I can reach my server using the domain offered by them: 
 curl <my\_machine\_name>.<domain\_from\_tailscale>.ts.net
 The entry point on my server is a traefik instance and I'm trying to configure it to route to all other services:
 This is my usual configuration on the docker-compose.yml 
 ````
 labels:
 - "traefik.enable=true"
 - "traefik.http.services.flame.loadbalancer.server.port=5005"
 - "traefik.http.routers.flame.rule=Host(`flame.<tailscaledomain>.ts.net`)"
 - "traefik.http.routers.flame.entrypoints=web"
 ```
 ​
 but that doesn't work, I guess because tailscale doesn't know how to route this sub domain.
 is anyone having a similar setup?

 I've setup a global schedule with a snapshot time of 0:00 but the history and logs say that no snapshots were taken so far. Do I need to have a kopia daemon/service/container for regular snapshots?.. What is the correct way of setting this up?

 Is there anything like that available on the market?

Has anyone had any experience with this device, or would you recommend another, or in fact, would you suggest I just stick with running everything on my 918+??

Aruba AOW4010 as my main gigabit switch
 ZyXEL (idk the model) 100 mbit/s switch as a backup
 Random blank patch panel from amazon
 Fiber optic lc to lc patch panel from a friend
 3x HP Compaq SFF pc's from school: 
 One running Truenas Scale, 1x 160Gb HDD as a boot drive, 500Gb and 8Tb HDDs as my Pool running a few NFS and SMB shares and running my plex, sonarr, radarr, etc... services
 One running Proxmox, with VMs for PiHole, a Minecraft Server, a MySQL database, a simple website, a Signum Plotter and Miner, connected to my mentioned NFS share. MC, DB and PiHole VMs are automatically backed up to my Truenas Box daily.
 The last one running OPNSense. Connecting to it via OpenVPN, because I want to keep my Lab separated from the rest of our network.
 
  
I know, cable management, etc... is pretty bad at the moment, but for now, this is just a proof of concept. I've only spent about 80€ so far, 50€ for the rack itself, 20€ for the blank patch panel, and about 10€ for the keystones and cage nuts, I can't really complain. I'm still going to school, so I'm on a pretty tight budget, but I'll do the most out of it.

 The project uses microservices with k3s, and I have a service which builds containers based on a GitHub repo the user uploads. The cluster is also responsible for taking the built containers and running them in their own separate namespace. I'm skeptical that the Pis won't be powerful enough to host all the services as well as build and run containers simultaneously, and I don't know how well it will scale either.
 I wanted to start with a 3-4 node cluster of RPI CM4s, but are there any alternatives I should consider over an RPI cluster?

 x399 1920x mellanox 455A
 I almost finished the hardware part of my first NAS and now I need to chose an OS and NAS software. I was wondering what you would chose.
 The requirements are:
  
very little command line, easy to setup and use, easy to expand when I add drives
 RAID0 m.2 for the work drive, auto backup to HDD
 I'd like to get close to the throughput of the mellanox while keeping power consumption lowest possible.
 eventually install a git server and a davinci resolve server, the resolve server has a linux variant
 after I chose which 4x m.2 card I prefer, that'll free up one port for a GPU, then this NAS can be used as a desktop to do work, no gaming
 the client is a windows machine connected directly to it via a twinax cable and the second NIC is linked to the wifi router for desktop access
 if setting it up in RDMA that's be cool to offload the cpu, as long as it's easy to do
  
Thanks!

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just installed Umbrel on my server and I am currently setting it up. I am following this guide that I found on this sub to set up a Jellyfin Media Server. The guide uses qBittorent in the set up, but sadly Umbrel doesn't have it in its app store. I am still new to this, so I would prefer to avoid the figuring out of how to install it manually and enable access to other containers like Radarr and Sonarr from it.
 So is there any way to use Transmission to have multiple download folders? IPer the tutorial, categories are created in qBittorrent with different save paths. So that torrents from Radarr download into one folder and torrents from Sonnar download into another folder. Making it much easier to organize a Jellyfin library. Is something like this possible with Transmission? If not, those of you who use transmission, how do you organize your Jellyfin library?
 P.S. I saw Umbrel has community stores you can add. Any trustworthy one that has qb there?

I have a Dell r720 which had both a bricked iDrac and a failing emmc with the “failed to write errors” after find this out I bought 2 replacement emmc chips off eBay to try replace the dead flash. Then lost the chips for 6 months… after I had found them again the fun began.
 I have a decent hot air station which definitely helps in doing this, also flux and board preheating helps tremendously otherwise you risk lifting traces. I took the motherboard out of…]]></summary>

 Basically i am looking for a program that will automatically record twitch livestreams. Currently i just manually record using browser extensions but i often end op missing big parts of the stream as i dont notice they went live. I tried searching around but i cant find anything that dosent require you to have 20 years of experience in IT to download/use. VODs wont work since they have muted parts or are straight up not uploaded.
 All i would want it to do is automatically detect when a set streamer goes live and record it untill they go offline. Just in case it should also not corrupt the files if the stream crashes or otherwise goes out (on the streamers end).
 Know of anything i could use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I purchased a z620 on ebay... someone I've purchased from before. It won't boot and they are taking their time responding so I thought in the meantime I'd pick the community's brain.
 I've tested with several CPUs and several sticks of memory both 2 and 4gig. 
 I've tried another video card.
 I've re-seated every cable and I've tried it with no CPU and/or no memory in varying combinations.
 With any CPU installed and one or two memory sticks I get a single beep.... And HP's list of beep codes shows 2 beeps and 3 beeps etc.... but NOTHING for a single beep. 
 Furthermore even at idle pre-boot the cpu heats up something fierce.... possibly just because the fan isn't spinning yet? 
 The led on the motherboard is solid blue and the PSU light is solid green (I think it was green?)
 The bios has been reset several times plus I've flushed the PSU caps by unplugging and holding power.
 I never get a video signal under any of these conditions. The fans ramp up sometimes tho I'm afraid I missed making notes about what combinations of the above result in this.
 Any ideas? Is this just a toast MB? PSU? Is it haunted by the ghost of Nicola Tesla?
 Thanks!

 I'm looking to expand my general purpose server (Proxmox w/ TrueNAS VM + others) storage. There seem to be several external HBAs (Dell SC220, Dell MD1200, etc.) that are very reasonably priced.
 The server currently has two SAS Cards flashed to LSI 9211 IT mode with direct passthrough to TrueNas and I have a few PCIe slots open. 
 Are these SAS HBAs compatible with SATA drives that's friendly to ZFS (i.e. has full access to the drives)? I know I'll need to get the cable converters but anything else I should be looking out for?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently in the process of building my new storage system and planing the power solution.
 After some research (and discovering the fact that psu only provide a fraction of their capacity @ 5v)
 I think i found a solution.
 A year ago corsair officially started offering a 12v to 5v adapters for their psus.
 https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/Categories/Products/Accessories-%7C-Parts/CORSAIR-%2B5V-Load-Balancer/p/CP-8920275
 If i understand correctly each unit takes one 8pin and provides 20A @ 5v (100w according to their website)
 This bundled with a 1500w psu like the HX1500i (with 9 8pin/pcle & also some 5v directly of the psu),
 might be able to power that amount of drives.
 9 adapter x 20A @ 5v = 180A @ 5v
 + 25A (from psu itselfe) = total of 205A @ 5v.....
 205A should be more than enough for 48 drives even if all would startup at the same time....
 With delayed spinup this should theoretically be able to support more than double that.
 What do you think of this? Did i make a mistake somewhere?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! I just got a second server and want to try out proxmox HA (I already use proxmox standalone). Since I'm going to be making a lot of changes to my setup I was wondering what the best way to connect my hard drives to each servers might be. In my first server I have an LSI 9260-4i RAID card with 4 800GB SSDs, combined into 2 virtual 800GB drives via RAID 1. Am I better off skipping the raid card an connecting the drives directly to the 6Gb/s and 3Gb/s sata ports on to mobo?
 Notes
 1) The supermicro motherboard I have doesn't have it's own RAID manager, but I think I can setup zfs or ceph in proxmox?
 2) My servers: SuperServer 5018A-FTN4 , so far the first server was been great for a debian VM, home assisant VM, and a frigate LXC.
 3) I don't have any type of nas ATM.

As someone that is quite new to homelabbing and server usage, I was wondering if anyone either knew anything about these servers, or if anyone has any ideas for decent use cases for them. I picked them up purely out of opportunistic fortune, so I had no use case or anything in mind. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Another day, another problem solved by having a managed switch.
 In one part of the house, video calls, sometimes, drop out a tiny bit here and there—in another part of the house, they are fine. Other Internet usage seems fine in the affected part of the house, so how do you resolve this issue? Well, this can be a bit troublesome to troubleshoot, but, in my case, the managed switch helped track down the culprit pretty fast.
 So, like any good tech guy with a homelab, I SSHed into my trusty switch and looked at the statistics for all the interfaces. Unexpectedly, one of the interfaces was communicating at 100Mbps when it should be 1000Mbps! Since my documentation is good, I quickly noticed that port was one of my Wireless Access Points (WAP). The plot thickens!
 Next, I reviewed the counters for that port and, well, lots of errors and drops on that port! Shouldn’t be happening! So, I proceeded to reseat both ends of the CAT6a cable and returned to my SSH session. Same thing. Still negotiating at a lowly 100Mbps.
 I grab a new CAT6a cable (spare cables are a must for a homelab!), swap the cables out and re-return to my SSH session. 1000Mbps is now correctly being negotiated! After verifying I’m connected to this WAP, I proceed to download a large file. Zero errors and drops on this port! Success! I proceed to have a not too long, but not too short, video call and, well, all is well again!
 Last step is to make absolutely certain the affected cable is in the garbage, so it never gets used again!
 Cheers!
 TL;DR: Invest in a managed switch—you get a lot of advanced functionality and it will save you from future frustrating IT episodes!

 I've never owned a supermicro chassis before - generally how loud the chassis and PSU fans are at low load? I've got a chenbro case at that is pretty annoying to listen to even on the lowest fan speeds
 Secondly, I see some of these backplanes come with 1 vs 2 expanders - is this purely for redundancy? Will all of the bays work even with just the 1 expander backplane? (SATA drives if it matters)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Got a new (to me) ASUS server and while I was checking it out I noticed that in the "Server Mgmt" tab of the BIOS the field titled "BMC Self Test Status" and the value is "FAILED".
 https://preview.redd.it/xvs0h0h1bx4a1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ae1b515a0cf2140f11d8496b222ceb4afd8d13b
 I checked the manual for the server and on page 66 it says there's an LED on the board called "BMCLED1" which "blinks to indicate that the on-board BMC is functional." However, mine is just a constant and very, very dim green LED (no blinking).
 On page 126 of the manual it shows more options than I have on the "Server Mgmt" tab, including a toggle for "BMC Support" (Enabled/Disabled).
 I tried updating the BIOS to the latest one, but no change (not unexpectedly). Is there anything I can do to try and recover the BMC, or is it toast?
 Would appreciate any input, thanks.
 For reference:
 Server: ASUS RS100-E10-PI2
 Motherboard model: ASUS P11C-M/4L
 BIOS version: 4003 (latest)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all.
 I have a couple of servers racked up at home. I'm looking at using server 2 as a mirror of the data on server 1. I have manually copied all of the data over (about 48tb) manually, but keeping them the same is going to be an impossible task to keep up on manually.
 I'm looking for suggestions on what software would best fit my needs for keeping the data backed up/identical. I have enough horsepower that I can create VM's if needed.
 Not sure I'll be able to hit all of these targets, but here is what I'm hoping for: - Scan server 1 and server 2. Copy any missing files from server 1 to server 2. - Ease of use / intuitive. I'm not much the command line guy, but can be taught. Something that is relatively easy to use would be a bonus. - Incremental vs. Differential - which would best fit my needs? - Anything I'm missing? I don't know what I don't know.
 Any guidance would be amazing. This is a whole new realm for me, so all input is greatly appreciated!
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've used Piwigo for years to host my photos, and I want to move them to AWS where object storage is cheap. There's a piwigo plugin for this, but it's 9 years old and doesn't claim compatibility with any recent release.
 With the widespread use of AWS free tier and also homemade k8s and the like I'd sort-of expected this to be a well-worn problem, but I've scanned the docs for all the self-hosted image galleries I can find and none seem to claim to do this.
 Has anyone got any recommendations for a gallery that does this, or one that has a plugin I've not found? I upload with shotwell and would like to keep that if I can.
 I know I can s3fs it but that feels a bit bodgy and likely to have odd problems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm just starting out on the journey of replacing my QNAP NAS with a custom build. I want this computer to be on 24/7 so energy efficiency is probably important. I have used the QNAP for plex and as my personal cloud storage. I would like to use it for more but the j1800 is pretty limiting. I like to tinker so home automation, plex, moonlight, some form of ad blocker, Linux iso collections and virtual machines to play around with are all on the list of goals for this next machine.
 I was looking towards a lga 1700 based build and was thinking about a i3 12100t. I want to rack mount this little guy inside a silverstone RM41-H08.
 I want to start off efficient but I'm not sure that the T series chips will be worth starting with if eventually I build this out with 8+ spinning disks and a dGPU and 10gig NIC and all of these other power hungry parts.
 I try to build to use for a decade or even potentially longer. I'm just not sure that i won't want to upgrade the cpu sooner than later.
 I would love to hear about your experiences as well as opinions! 
 Thanks!

 I recently upgraded to 3gbps fibre internet service and wanted to take advantage on my wee homelab so I purchased an ASUS XG-C100C V2 PCIe NIC for $130 CAD. Well I should have done more research because this card has a habit of completely freezing up when under heavy load, requiring a NIC reset to temporarily resolve the issue. There is no updated firmware or drivers available, so I'm returning it and looking for another.
 Any affordable, stable recommendations? The modem/router only has one 10GB Ethernet port. Bonus points for an affordable, stable 10GB switch.

 The drives spin up (I can feel them spinning after disconnecting them)
 I pulled a functioning SATA drive out of the exact same slot that the SAS drive is not working in

Since then I've been migrating services from that "master" LXC into dedicated containers, which was particularly useful for Home Assistant, which is increasingly a total nightmare to run pretty much anywhere outside HAOS. So, HASS, Unifi and Logitech Media Server all live outside that LXC, and they're pretty happy living outside on their own. I don't mind taking the slight hit to memory as I've got plenty in the server.
 But now I'm wondering if I should move nextcloud outside as well. Can folks recommend an approach? Looks like NextCloudPi is one option. Any opinions from others who are in the same sort of proxmox deliberations? Best to give nextcloud it's own pasture, or is it happy grazing alongside the general rabble of sonarr, radarr, etc etc

 I have a nginx webserver to access some services from outside my home network. I have a Wireguard server to access some services that are not exposed via webserver. When I'm not connected to the wireguard server, I can access the webserver exposed services without any errors.
 The problem I am having is when my phone (wireguard client) is connected to the wireguard server and tries to access the webserver services (https://app.domain.tld), it keeps giving an `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` error and message that says "Your connection is not private". 
 However, while connected to the wireguard server, my client is able to access internet and LAN services using hostname:port (http://192.168.1.6:3030). 
 I am not sure why this is case. Oddly enough, I am able to access my webserver services from within my LAN as long as i am not connected to the wireguard server.
 ​
 Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. It is quite annoying to having to connect/disconnect to my wireguard vpn server in order to access different services.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bear with me a moment, this one's a little complicated, but I'd really appreciate some assistance from anyone more experienced with these drives than myself.
 I bought two 16TB WD Elements drives during a Black Friday sale and subsequently shucked them after testing them via USB. I removed the 3.3v pins (third from the left, etc, done this before on other models) on both, but one of the drives still doesn't want to come alive when plugged in unless I'm using the USB board supplied with the drive enclosure. The drive works, just only when using the enclosure's board.
 The machine I would like to use this drive on is a NAS enclosure with a SATA backplane, so I can't use a molex adapter to get around the usual 3.3v issue. If I'm not able to get anywhere otherwise, I plan to try swapping the drives between machines, but would like to avoid this if possible as it would require (another) array parity rebuild.
 Both drives report as WD160EDGZ-11B2DA0. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Here's a picture of the SATA connector.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have two of the US dub of the 1980s Mr. Men and Little Miss VHS tapes I have since getting into the series back in 2008 and a Anpanman tape that has 3 episodes that aren't on DVD. My brother knows how to record the tapes and digitize them. But there's a few problems. One is that our VCR is a Magnavox VCR/DVD combo GDV228MG9 , and that the tapes can sometimes jump. And if that happens, it messed up the recording.
 My brother researched that we should invest on another VCR player that is S-VHS. But he also told me that we should also look into a VCR with a time base corrector. The major roadblock is that they are too much to buy. And while trying to not spend the money on foolish things is a step, it'll still take a long to achieve that. Not only that, I don't know how long the tapes will last, especially since the Mr. Men ones are in their mid 30s. And I can't just simply buy another copy of the tapes as they aren't on ebay anymore. And I don't know anybody that has the best equipment that can actually digitized the tapes. I did had one friend years ago who helped me with a recorded Thomas tape, but I don't know if he still does it.

 Intel OPTANE H10 16GB + 256GB SSD M.2 is selling on eBay for $30; is that good compared to a 500GB WD Blue SN570 NVMe for $40. What advantages to Optane add?
 I posted in HomeLab because I intend to use 2 of these for a mirrored proxmox boot drive, but I do tend to reuse hardware for new projects often so getting a good value, even if it's overkill for this use case, is still good.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is my first ever Reddit post so apologies I'm if doing Reddit wrong :P. I have gone through a number of recommendations on this subreddit but run into trouble after installing with it not having features etc. It also seems as though the list of active projects is constantly in flux.
 I have 1TB of photos currently synced via OneDrive. They are organized by year/month and have tags of names and star ratings. Unfortunately, the Onedrive backend is slow (especially for 4k video) and is limited in features. My dream would be to have a shared self-hosted lightroom replacement but my realistic workflow is to use lightroom for editing and then have a full-library export that will be viewable by family members online. I was wondering if ya'll could give me a recommendation. Here is what I am looking for:
 Minimum:
  
Navigate images/videos by folder structure
 Authentication (would be great if you could use google for the login flow and just save a list of permitted email addresses).
 Searchable, including keywords and star ratings
 A nice interface that will get the stamp of approval from the lady
 Web interface
 Feature complete or actively updated
 Free OR a perpetual license (no subscriptions!)
  
Really want:
  
Transcoding to stream 4k videos over 5mbps up data pipe (hardware transcoding preferred). I have an AMD cpu and graphics card.
 Search includes things automatically identified in the images (beach, tree, ball - nothing crazy). Facial recognition could be nice too.
  
Nice to Have
  
Map view
 Be able to work on the main database:
 Phone upload (android and ios)
 Can view Canon raw files (Canon R7 and old EOS images) - could just be the preview thumbnail
 Can view .heif files
 The source of truth is the file system - Any modifications made in the UI (keywords, captions, rating) are stored in the file itself (not an app database)

 Our main services run on a Synology NAS, HomeAssistant on a NUC, PiHole (for local DNS too) and NPM on 2 different RasPis and all that goes through a ASUS Router with Merlin Firmware.
 I'm exposing the Ports on NPM so I can access Bitwarden and HomeAssistant, other services like Plex do it on their own (UPNP?).
 Any general advice I could follow? I wanted to use Cloudflare tunnels with Google auth, but it seems anyone with Google auth could log in there, lol...? didn't seem to be whitelist-able? But that has the downside of not being able to use Bitwarden. 
 Maybe I have a fundamental misunderstanding on those things. Since I plan on re-doing my networking soon I thought I ask now :) Thanks for any advice.

 I'm looking to expand my homelab out to the cloud, namely in order to have off-site backup capabilities. I want to continue to manage my own services, so Backblaze, while superb, isn't something I want to pursue for this (though, I do use Backblaze to backup the computer I'm currently sitting at).
 Can anyone direct me to the absolute cheapest VPS provider you can find? Number of cores is unimportant, nor is RAM. The biggest criteria is cheap storage. To do that, I'm 100% fine with using legacy spinning storage rather than SSD's and NVMe.
 Ideally, looking for a VM with 1-2 TB of storage in the $10-15 range. I don't know if that's too optimistic.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm a 2tb m2 SSD that has been running a bit hot in his computer for a few years now. We had a scare once when I wouldn't mount properly on boot, causing him to think he lost the last 27 years of photos and random internet forum backups that he has stored on me, but one reboot later, he found me again. It gave him a little bit of a scare, so he found another one of me (THE AUDACITY to think he could find another ME) and stuck us together into RAID0. 
 Lemme tell you what, this man was ESTATIC to find out that he had double the storage, while still having the protection of RAID. He went on an unhinged downloading spree, grabbing everything he could find online he thought was rare and people might want one day. Random things like old MTV shows, a live action Spirited Away play (ITS ALREADY A MOVIE, WHO NEEDS A PLAY?), and technical manuals for old hardware (?????????).
 Anyways, it was a lot. The heat and pressure to deliver finally was enough for me, and I said 'Peace, Im out'. 
 Well, turns out he didn't like that, and started breaking things. I tried to get away, but he grabbed me before I could and said he was going to take me to a 'specialist' to get 'fixed'. Like, I don't need fixing – Ive made my choice. He kept claiming I was so valuable and he needed me, but then decided to treat me like that? Without any backups??? Clearly I wasn't that important to him. Regardless of my decisions, he hauled me down to a data specialist to recover some stuff, but they couldn't do anything. 
 So reddit, AITA for dying to teach him about backups and that RAID0 is not a backup?

I have been using TeamViewer for years to access my headless servers, but yesterday evening it decided to think I was using it for commercial purposes. I called support and filled out the form and everything, but I am basically screwed until they reinstate my free account.
 As soon as they reinstate my free account, the first thing I am doing is switch to another Remote Desktop service. Any recommendations? I have wanted to switch to something selfhosted for a while now, but I avoided it because I need to be able to remote into computers even when the selfhosted VM might now be working. Since a Remote Desktop service is so important to have always working for me, I would really like a cloud service, but I don’t know if any that offer the same features as TeamViewer for free.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, usually on my servers I configure msmtp with an external free mail service provider to send e-mail notifications to myself. But this has one limitation. I can only send from the registered e-mail address (eg. secretname@provider.com) because everything else (eg. secretname@mydomain.com) wouldn't be allowed by that specific mail provider.
 This isn't a problem when I'm sending notifications to myself, but some self hosted services rely on e-mail. For example Gitea "anonymizes" emails like github does. So it gives users mail addresses like skdfhskdjf@noreply.my-gitea-instance.de
 This is a feature that I can't use with above limitations. Now I am searching for a better solution where I can send e-mails from my own domain or whatever else.
 Should I host a very basic (sending only) mail server myself? Or should I register somewhere, where I can create unlimited e-mail accounts for my own domain and still use the msmtp route?
 The last one seems difficult because I already use that domain for my private e-mail. So in that domain's DNS is already the MX records of my mail provider. Which doesn't allow multiple accounts etc. I'm not sure if I can set MX records of another provider on the same domain... PS: I don't want to switch away from my existing mail provider.
 What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi homelab community!
 I am planning to move parts of my homelab infrastructure from my local server to a VPS provider (like linode, aws, azure, ...)At least I want move applications that should be accessible from the web.e.g. my private homepage, a small community website, a small application that i created for my business.
 I plan to use NGINX proxy manager to enforce and handle SSL and authelia for 2FA.
 My preferred option would be to separate the infrastructure from the webserver.But with that my question is:"How to prevent direct access to the webserver and basically skipping nginx and authelai like shown in the picture below for client 3?"
 Option1
 As i do have full access to the VPS via SSH I could of course also install docker on Virtual Server2 and handle NGINX and Authelia on the same server to make things way easier:
 Option 2
 But I think the solution to keep the infrastructure topics separated from the webserver seems way cleaner to me as i am also planning to futher lockdown with e.g. geoblocking, cloudflare, and so on.
 Any help/thoughts/suggestions or votes for option 1 or 2 would be highly appreciated.
 thanks and have a nice weekend,mike

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just recently started to self host, i have a raspberry pi running nextcloud and i got an awesome rush out of setting it all up, i don't have a public IP so i even had to setup an ssh tunnel between an oracle VPS and the RPI to enable access everywhere.
 Anyways, i want to keep playing with selfhosted services but I ran out of VPS and i want to get a PC i can use as a home server to play with.
 I found a good deal for the M900 tiny and i plan to install Ubuntu on it and play with virtual machines on it. 
 I'm completely amateur, i don't have any formal IT training but i do know a bit about networking, web development, python programming and I know fairly well my way around Linux although I'm far from a sysadmin. 
 So I would like to ask for advice regarding if this computer is a good place to start my home lab. I don't have a much of a budget.
 These are kind of services would I like to run off the computer in the VMs I'd set up: -mail in a box -adguard -plex -mysql -mongo -some websites -many discord bots 
 I wouldn't run all, and definitely not at the same time. They're just examples.
 So is this computer good for me? Should I look for something else? What are your recommendations?
 Edit: Thanks everyone for answering, I just order it. I'll try to run everything on docker containers to use the most out of the pc. I'll be updating how it goes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been setting up wired network runs at home, and decided to use CAT6, since it's rated for 10G up to 55m, which is well above what I needed. The main network rack is in the garage, and I ran four CAT6 cables from the "server closet" on the second story, each about 75ft/23m.
 I have an old storage server (Supermicro SuperStorage 6048R-E1CR24L) with dual Intel X540 NICs. I patched it through to the Mikrotik CRS312 switch, but it only auto-negotiated at 1G. I saw in Winbox that "10G" would flash for a brief moment under the list of peer advertised speeds, but it would never stick.
 My server runs SmartOS, an Illumos/Solaris derivative. I searched around to see if anyone else had issues getting 10G working on X540 NICs, and tried some of the suggestions, but nothing has worked so far. I brought the server down to the garage and connected it with a short CAT6 cable, and voila, it negotiated 10G with no problem. I haven't tried another OS yet to see if that might make it work.
 Long-term, though, I don't want to keep the server in the garage, especially come spring and summer. So, long story short, I'm wondering if anyone else has had issues with X540 NICs not being able to negotiate 10G speeds at distances within the CAT6 spec?
 For contrast, I have a Mac Studio in the room with the "server closet," and it negotiates 10G. I tested the speeds with iperf3 between it and the storage server, and it can get ~9.35G one-way. So I don't think there's any interference that would explain this behavior. Although when I run with --bidir, the bandwidth drops to 7.97G and 5.97G; could this indicate something is wrong with the runs, terminations, etc.?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. An old NUC 5i5RYH 1.6GHz w/ 8GB of RAM serves as my main desktop PC running Windows 10 Pro in my study. I really don't expect much from it, just browsing the web and running MS Office-type programs. No games, minimal video. It works as a home computer.
 I have an HPE Proliant Microserver Gen 10 Plus with a Xeon E-2444 3.4GHz w/ 32GB of RAM running Windows Server Standard 2019 with the Windows Server Essentials Experience added. It's basically a file server but I also run a couple of programs remotely using a Remote Desktop app as a poor man's VMWare type arrangement. Other than my internet upload connection being slow when accessing it remotely, it works well.
 I'm considering building a VM with Windows 10 Pro using Hyper-V as replacement for the old NUC. I can add audio support by way of the server's PCIe gen3 x16 slot and dedicate a network port to the VM. Other than the NUC supporting hyperthreading, it seems to me that the VM would be better. It would also get rid of some unnecessary older hardware. Also, since I'm running the server, anyway, it would reduce power consumption.
 When I posted this same question on the s\intelnuc, I was advised to inquire here.
 Suggestions? Critique? If this would work without constant maintenance (other than normal software updates) can you recommend a video/sound card? The slot is PCI-E 3.0 x16, low profile, mounted horizontally on a daughter board.

What kind of latency should I look for from DNS? My closest VPS location is Vultr in Seattle which averages about 16-18MS most of the time.
 Are there security implications of hosting a DNS server on the public internet?
  
Never done this before but being able to use it on the go without a VPN sounds nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am looking to purchase either a system containing an i5-6500T or an i5-4790T. They perform similarly, with around a 20% improvement for the newer chip, however the i5-4790T PC that I can purchase has 1x8gb DDR3, compared to the 1x4gb DDR4 in the i5-6500T PC - giving the older chip PC more upgradability on a budget. 
 ​
 The only other reason that I can see for preferring the newer chip is that its integrated graphics can be better passed through to multiple VMs (How useful is GVT-g?), however I am unsure as to how competent the 4th Gen i5 would be for simple video playback in a VM. 
 ​
 Which option would be superior?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently discovered a strange DNS issue with one machine on my home network. From all of my testing in troubleshooting, I am left with the conclusion that the endpoint protection suite (Carbon Black) is tampering with and replacing my DNS results. Let me explain.
 Over the weekend I added pihole to my network in a high availability cluster using keepalived. This essentially creates a virtual IP on my network that can point to any one of 3 machines, depending on their status. On my network, this virtual IP is 192.168.50.30, and I have configured my router to use it for DNS. Testing this on my main Windows 11 machine, and several other Ubuntu and Debian VMs, it works wonderfully without issue.
 My work machine is a different story however. My domain name, lets call it xyz.house is registered with cloudflare. In pihole, I added an A record for pihole.local to 192.168.50.30, and then a CNAME for pihole.internal.xyz.house pointing to pihole.local. When making DNS requests, the local hostname pihole.internal.xyz.house fails to resolve in a very strange way. At least I thought I wasn't resolving because only the hostname was returned; no IP. Then I realized this was only happening hostnames that actually exist externally of pihole. Once I realized this, I tried other domains. Adding google.com as a local A record in pihole, which was likewise ignored. It seemed that my work machine ignores my local DNS results when the hostname is a real hostname registered somewhere else. As if the endpoint protection is trying to avoid DNS spoofing/poisoning. I also realized that the reason I didn't get an IP response, is because there wasn't an A record listed for xyz.house or pihole.internal.xyz.house in cloudflare.
 Has anyone ever heard of this?

 I'm fairly new to datahoarding so if I make any mistakes please let me know.
 I have recently purchased a brand-new 4TB Seagate Barracuda HDD off of Amazon, and it arrived fine. There was no visible damage to the box, and it was firmly strapped onto some sort of carboard frame inside.
 I ran multiple tests on it to check for errors with 2 programs (StableBit Scanner and HD Tune Pro), and both of them showed the drive as completely clean.
 However, I found that it makes a really faint rattling (and sometimes more scratchy) noise. The sound is more common in the first 1.5 billion sectors or so, and gets less common and quieter near the end of the disk. 
 Is the disk fine? Should I RMA it immediately?
 (Also, either the SMART data is really weird or I just don't know how to interpret it properly could someone help)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently installed homer and just finished adding all of my groups and apps to it. I'm using the 
 background-image: "/assets/tools/image.png" 
 command so that I can add my desired picture. I saw in the documentation on github that you can create custom configurations. I tried looking up how to do this since the yml file is in html I believe. I tried using the things listed such as 
 background-size: background-position: 
 but these did not help with anything. I'm new to editing scripts like this and am looking for some guidance. I'd like position the picture in the center of my screen instead of it automatically enlarging itself. I would also like to add an image to the header since I saw that was possible in one of the custom configs. Would I need to create a new yml file or can I edit this into my current one?

 I'd either put my own components in, or if it's a DAS box, get a new HBA and build a NAS in a cheap 2U Rosewill case.
 I don't want to use something like a Dell R730xd and do an all in one because of the high fan noise.
 I was thinking a Dell power vault off of FleaBay or something similar, but I'm not sure how loud they are. 
 Any suggestions? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is my cluster under Proxmox VE based on Dell Optiplex 9020 Micro in socket 1150 (Intel 4th gen) which are the last models to accept Xeon processors, which makes them more affordable than the following generations.
 The good points are :
 - Power consumption (15-20 watts on average),
 - Intel vt-d instructions to do passthrough with Linux virtual machines (desktop instance, kodi, batocera) or to do transcoding with Plex/Jellyfin,
 - Very quiet,
 - Low power multi-core processors with hyper-threading (score of 5449 for the i7-4785t and 6168 for the E3-1265l v3 on cpubench) that allow to run several virtual machines without flinching,
 Specifications
 - CPU : two models in i7-4785t (4c/8t, 2,2 Ghz, 35 watts) and one in E3-1265l v3 (4c/8t, 2,5 Ghz, 45 watts),
 - Memory: 8 GB DDR3 (up to 16 GB maximum),
 - 256 GB SSD,
 ​
 I got all three for just over 300 euros. At the moment, the E3-1265l v3 is at 33 dollars on Aliexpress (6168 pts on cpubench) so for those who want to make a HomeLab for cheap, the TinyMiniMicro in socket 1150 have the best value for money because above, the Xeon processors do not work anymore and the price is much higher.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[tl;dr Is looking at source code the best way to rip these days?
 I've been using VLC for youtube but many of the instructions on how to do so, are now outdated. Obviously youtube tries to stop this sort of stuff so I've used a couple different versions of this method over the years with moderate success. The other thing I've tried is chrome extensions which again, may work for a period of time but ultimately get blocked. Many of the times, the higher quality versions I've never been able to download. It seems like the VLC method maxed out at 720p/1080p. I'd really like to be able to save content from youtube and others in the max quality possible.
 I think the best way from here is to examine the code which has worked for me in the past (5-10+ years) when code was a little more straightforward, but finding the actual content is "wrapped" (sorry I don't code) in java(?). I'd like to learn enough to squirrel this stuff out myself, any suggestions - or does a website's media player query things to an outside source to pull content? 
 Right now, I'd like to rip this content and three extensions fail to even find the audio or video. Side rant: anyone come up with a solution to save images as jpeg/png that are displayed as .webp?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently purchased a 14TB Seagate Exos and it's one of the quietest drives I've ever owned. The only quieter drive I've owned was a consumer 4TB 5400 RPM SMR drive which was dead silent.
 I've owned a 150GB WD Raptor that sounded like a sewing machine it was so loud.
 In 2009 I also purchased the first 1TB WD Black drive which wasn't nearly as loud but still noisy. I was expecting the drive to be as loud as that WD Black but it's silent in comparison even after writing several TB to it already. 
 At least for Seagate helium filled drives they are silent compared to consumer drives from just a decade ago.
 At first I thought it was louder than it actually was because it was resonating against my case but I simply added some foam pads and it's silent now, I'm amazed. The only time I can tell the drive is on is from the very occasional clicks I consider normal from any spinning hard disk. Am I alone in this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, 
 I have recorded manny records from my vinyls to MP3 files. Sometimes I have problems to find the right music to prepare my mix with my dj controller. So I want to tag my mp3s, like in paperless DMS. For example: Feral - Medium #techno #deep #key:minor #intro
 I would like to search the tracks and create a tracklist and later download the mp3 files.
 It sounds a little complicated, it probably is, but I can't remember any artistic names to search the tracks. For me it's by feel and this feel I would like to write in tags. If there is such a thing I would be happy if you can tell me such a web application. If you are DJs yourselves and you have a better idea, then I would be happy about advice and ideas.

 I couldnt find a definitiv answer for this. Ill make it real simple
 I want to host games and servers for a community where complete strangers have access, aswell as its a little bit of a shady one. So the chances of a hacking attack is increased.
 I have read that hamachi basically cuts out the protection you would usually have with a firewall and the internet. So im assuming that a attack becomes much more sucessfull.
 Do any of the virtual network programs guarantee security from hackers, or are there ways to make it secure.
 ​
 thanks in advance for help

 I have a Proxmox host running two VMs. One is Ubuntu Server and another is Windows Server 2022. The Ubuntu VM is a docker host with a Microsoft SQL Server container running on it. Here is the docker-compose.yml I used: 
 version: "3.2" services: mssql: image: 'mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest' container_name: orion_db hostname: sql1 ports: - '1433:1433' environment: - ACCEPT_EULA=Y - SA_PASSWORD=<insertpassword> volumes: - '/.drive:/var/opt/mssql' 
 Both VMs are on the same subnet with a firewall rule for the Ubuntu VM to explicitly allow connections from the Windows Server VM over ports 1433 and 1434. The DB server has also been configured to allow outbound connections through the CLI.
 However, when launching Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio on the Windows Server VM, I am only able to see the databases running on the Windows Server VM, even when selecting "Network Servers". Is there a step I missed or did I misconfigure something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently built a new tool to do some devops work in my home lab, which was initially intended to be a more "advanced" exec handler for serf so I could more effectively change backend vm's of my custom load balancer among other things. What I quickly realized was that it was way simpler and easier to use than ansible / chef etc, especially for golang apps where I just needed to drop a binary set up a user and create a systemd unit file with a template, then start the service on an lxc container.
 Some of the key things that make it useful for me is to secure bootstrap of new instances (cloud init) or (golden images), as I can dynamically provision based on instance id/hostname/ip which is locked to particular s3 prefix(or minio), which means I don't need any external inbound requests to the server to provision at all and changing install is as simple as just terminating instance / updating s3 config. It does still function well for serf too though as an exec handler and I now use it as both os installer and exec handler, that first sets up nginx but also can take the members in the serf role and quickly update nginx config + HUP nginx with new members as example.
 The templating uses go templates but variable injection can be done either by providing a preset value or by running a command inline, so you can use hostname -f of the live system to feed a template var. Second to that I built in os limits, so in the same file you can run 2 cmd executions but limit one to ubuntu or specifically ubuntu:20.04 and the other for redhat... This was required for things like installing bind tools which has different package names between the OS's 
 Right now there is an nginx install example but I might create a simple one for home assistant and magic mirror etc, with module updates.
 Either way would love some feedback: https://github.com/Nitecon/bruce

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I've been the happy owner of a PowerEdge T20, that I bought for a bargain price many years ago (2015?).
 It's served me very well, but I'm starting to think it wouldn't hurt to spend a bit of money and get it a bit more up-to-date on the power front. It would be fine for me to keep the body of the thing, but I would've thought I could upgrade the motherboard and chip, possibly power supply. However, I'm not at all a PC build expert, so don't have much of an idea what the best deals are.
 I'd be looking for excellent bang-for-buck, that should be significantly better than what I already have, but for minimal cost. The thing cost me only something like €250 when I got it, after all.
 Specs:
  
Motherboard Dell VD5HY: https://www.itcreations.com/product/84192
 CPU: Xeon(R) CPU E3-1225 v3 @ 3.20GHz 
 Having Intel QuickSync for Plex seems to be quite desirable?
 
 Currently 16GB ram. Would be nice to be able to increase that, with good value chips
  
Hope someone with better skills can advise!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,i'm getting a little frustrated trying to find a to-do app with kanban-view. There are some cool approaches on the market - but they are never thought through to the end.
 What do I need?
  
Multiple listview (= Categories) for managing
  
 Tasks
 Subtasks
 Recurring-Tasks
 Due-Dates
 Priority
  
 Kanban-View for drag & drop between stages (Backlog, Planned, This Week, Today, Done)
 Mobile-Support for
  
 Creating new tasks
 Push-Notifications (Due-Dates)
  
Nice to have
  
Time Tracking
 Kanban with Swimlanes (e.g. List-Categories as Swimlanes)
 Additional Labels, Search-Function, etc.
  
What I tried:
  
Focalboard -> Nice Web UI, but not mobile-friendly (e.g. Reminder / Push), no recurring tasks
 Nextcloud -> No recurring tasks, buggy combination with Deck for Kanban
 Vikunja -> CalDAV-Sync is great, but it's not supporting Subtask-Sync and Recurring-Task-Sync
  
My dream would be a Vikunja with better Subtask-Creation (it's a pain doing this via UI) and CalDAV implementation, that I could use in combination with Tasks.org Android App with full features (recurring and subtasks) ...
 Any alternative on the market?

 Did you think about making a time capsule filled with data ?
 I'm talking in short term like 5 years of USB flash drive holding data. Home environment VS out doors ?
 Also did you ever think about making a time capsule that would hold its data for 100s of years ?
 With all the stuff lost this can be crucial in the future.
 For example the movie Nosferatu was literally ordered to be destroyed because of copyright violations it did.
 WE have it now because some tapes survived and now everything of that time is public domain so it is not a problem and a cultural treasure.

 I can personally get by with PWAs, but I vastly prefer having native applications, especially for services my partner also uses. As an iOS user I’m also kind of jealous of all of you in Android land, because that (unsurprisingly) seems to be the main focus for native apps for self hosted services.
 Also, what are some projects with nice mobile apps?

It seems like both sides of the tape were filled, and most of it is callers calling in to talk to Al Stanek, including my uncle who knew him. I'm pretty sure this isn't some "crazy lost history" type recording, but are there still archiving groups interested in any recording they can get their hands on? If so, please point me in the right direction.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a decade I was worried about my not backed up pictures which were on an external drive, so I went to back them up and the drive failed. Or so I thought. Repeated attempts to get the drive to spin up just resulted in a clicking head and nothing. So I put it in a drawer to eventually take to a data recovery service when I could afford it. 
 Time passes, and yesterday I was doing some file management of newer pictures which needed to happen (In addition to backing them up) when I got a wild hair to plug the drive in to see what would happen. Low and behold, it spins up....sort of. Same head skipping/stalling issue. The difference this time is I can see the files and am able to copy some, for a few seconds till it freezes. 
 Windows file transfer sucks for this so I try TeraCopy, pausing the transfer when it freezes, unplugging the drive, plugging it back in and starting the transfer over. This works...sort of. For whatever reason it only recognized about a third of the files this way. 
 So I try again, and this time it works flawlessly without any head issues throughout the entire transfer. I saved about 130GB worth of pictures from a fairly formative time in my life sort of by accident. Now I'm sorting them properly and backing up multiple copies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I got myself NAS to upgrade my HomeLab and want fix problems with current setup. First I'll describe my setup and issues with it because I may be approaching it completely wrong and missing obvious easy solution
 Current setup
  
VPS with static public IPv4
 RPI4 with 1x SSD for data
 Synology DS920+ (new, reason why I'm trying to upgrade my setup)
  
My home is behind CGNAT so I have VPS with NPM.. VPS is sending traffic to RPI4 trough ZeroTier to bypass CGNAT
 Problem with current setup
  
all traffic to my services like NextCloud is routed trough VPS and is HEAVILY bottle-necked by my slow internet
  
new setup i want to achieve
  
be able to access local services trough domain at local speeds 
 I want to add services like Jellyfin and be able to access them trough my domain (jellyfin.example.com) regardless of me being at home or not and when I'm at home not be bottlenecked by my internet.
 
  
Solution i thought of
  
run reverse-proxy at home
 use adguard's dns rewrite to send requests to my domain directly to reverse-proxy at home instead to my VPS and be bottlenecked by my internet
 redirect port 80 & 443 from my VPS to server at home
  
First I wanted to use "streams" in NPM but it didn't work for ports 80 & 443 (of course it didn't) Then I tried to achieve this setup with 'socat' but NPM failed to get SSL cert
 If someone doesn't know, NPM is NginxProxyManager
 info that may matter
  
I want to learn traefic and upgrade to it after I get this working, using NPM for now because of the ease of setup 
 if traefic will make my desired setup easier I'll go for it straight away

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi - if there is a better sub for this please let me know.
 I purchased a domain for a business idea a bit ago, things took longer to get going than I anticipated. Nothing was hosted on it yet, but it is the name I would like to launch this business under.
 I forgot (stupidly) to renew my domain. It expired at the end of September. It is currently in the "redemption period." My registrar was Namecheap. They said I could get it out of redemption for about $100 (I forget the exact amount) or that if I just waited eventually it would be released *as long as nobody buys it at the auction.* My initial plan was to just wait it out, and I should be getting close to the time where it is released per Namecheap's associate... Today, the Whois is still saying Namecheap redemption period.
 But I was thinking today, where is this auction? I can't seem to find anything with google. There shouldn't basically any value to this website (I did have content on it like 10 years ago but that has long since been taken down), but I don't really want to lose it to someone who might get it at an auction because I'm being cheap. So, if I could just go to the auction and win it there...wouldn't that work?
 I'm a little over my head in this one and appreciate any help. Thanks!

I got the refurbs from Amazon and ran badblocks on them, took nearly 2 weeks to finish four complete block by block write/read's but they all come back clean. So my plan is to buy one each month, so that by end of 2023 I will have 15 of them. three replicas x five 200tb units. So a total of 3PB with one PB of addressable storage. 
 As for the individual units, suggestions? I was going to just go with straight Raid-0 or JBOD setting. I am still learning how ADM works but I love how I could use these units to also host docker and they could play host to some container services. 
 Other concerns I need to work out are power, brown outs in winter and summer are not uncommon, but also the networking. These units can take up to 10gb for it's primary connector and I'd love to have all 15 for purposes of replication but if it's too pricey I can live with a 1gb switch instead. 
 Suggestions?

 ​
 It is, however, a little annoying to get a development cluster up and running to play with, so I wanted to share a *very* simplified set of ansible scripts for folks to get started with, quickly, because it's fantastic.
 ​
 If you're unfamiliar with the Hashicorp Stack, I put together a very brief write-up on its major components (Consul, Vault, Nomad), along with a repo with some ansible scripts and a Vagrant file for y'all to play around with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, since 1997, I've pretty much deleted nothing and have had multiple drive failures & recoveries. Anyway, now I have a file server (Windows Server 2019) that all these files have been dumped onto with no organization whatsoever (since with some of the drive failures, the folder structures were lost).
 I have anywhere between 3-6 copies of the same file as they existed on multiple drives. Is there any file deduplication software that can look through all these files, pick the non-corrupt ones (yes, I have those too) and place them elsewhere? We're talking close to 10+ million files.

 I am planning out networking/homeserver stuff for a new apartment, I have quite a bit of freedom and I already know what my use cases are, but want to do it right.
 Right now I have fiber coming into my apartment and I have the below setup working great for me:
  
generic ASUS router running openWRT
 1 managed switch (need VLANs)
 1 intel Nuc with Ubuntu acting as media PC / home server connected to a TV over HDMI.
  
The NUC has some file shares (few TB in external hard drives) to be accessed locally/over VPN, has Steam for streaming games from a PC (once a month max), Kodi (pretty much replaced by Jellyfin now) and a bunch of containers on it:

It would also be nice if it was capable of monitoring URL’s and taking a screenshot if the URL changes. I am also looking for software or an extension that is capable of retrieving images in the original resolution from multiple URLs. Something similar to Image Picka but capable of retaining the original resolution.
 Any information regarding these matters would greatly be appreciated, thanks.

 Not exactly the question for this sub, but you folks know everything AND Dell Optiplex desktops are quite popular among homelab enthusiasts...
 Long story short - I have several Dell Optiplex desktops I bought off DellRefurbished and ebay over the last 3-4 years, ranging from i5-4590 to i5-8500. Most serve some specific purpose (e.g. a BlueIris surveillance server), others just act as a "regular" PC I often RDP to on a daily basis from my work laptop. 
 Most of the time I would try to buy the desktop with Pro version of the OS (W10 pro, W7 pro), but it looks like I made a mistake once and bought one W10 Home machine. I can live with most limitations, except for the lack of RDP server functionality. 
 I tried rdpwrap on that machine and it usually works for a while, but Microsoft …]]></summary>

I had been using the Plexamp cast function and chromecasting from PodcastAddict on my regular phone to the stereo-phone when needed. I really like that with Plexamp I can use the "cast" menu to remotely control play/pause and volume as well as queuing up playlists etc, and I wanted that for podcast playback as well. I got some of that (play/pause and volume) on my desktop and other devices via KDE Connect, but not the ability to choose what's playing. Podcast Addict living on my phone also means that I don't have a way to maintain local copies, progress, and play history aside from the app's own backup and OPML exports.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to setup VLANs on my network and make sure it's correctly configured and secured so that things like for example VLAN Hopping are not possible and so on. I already know the whole concept of VLANs but I'm not quite sure about implementing it which is why I made this post. So, from my research online it shows that I need to:
 For Wireless:
 Create multiple SSIDs with VLAN IDs on them then mark a port as Trunk on the switch with all the VLAN IDs that were assigned to SSIDs. At the end just plug in the Wireless Access Point to that specific trunk port on the switch. Of course, the main appliance that acts as a router\firewall needs to have set VLANs in its configuration as well.
 For LAN:
 For the LAN I just configure a VLAN ID and a port on the switch itself to which I then plug a RJ45 cable into. Also, the router\firewall appliance has its own configuration for LAN VLANs.
 Is this how I should go about setting up VLANs or am I missing something here ?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The TP link has more than enough power for my needs , likely less power hungry, newer, and easier to configure but $100 and I'll have to source or make mounting ears. The Juniper can be had for around $60 with ears included, but likely way harder to configure for a n00b like me. My requirements are 16 port (8x PoE+ 30w) gigabit, rack mountable, not crazy power hungry (under 50w not including PoE)
 Are the extra ports and power consumption that I likely won't need worth the cost savings and configuration difficulty? I have only managed switches through GUI before.

I've looked around on ebay and other similar used sites, but have come up with wildly high prices. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am using the server for a plex library so I can further cut ties with streaming services.
 Edit I should mention I am in Canada, so the prices are super inflated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi ! I am kindda lost on all the small form factors PC around. Dell Optiplex, HP elitedesk, lenovo mxxx... 
 I'd like to build a simple router on a small PC, obviously it will need at least two NIC. 
 Someone from here showed me the Lenovo M720q, which can handle a i350 4x NIC on a PCIe entry. But currently I only find some pricey ones, and the i350 mod also costs a little. Around +300€ in total, not really worth it for a no wifi router (i'll think about getting a wifi access point later on).
 It's hard to say if other brands can do the same, they do have optional rear ports (vga / hdmi / rs232), but i'm not sure those places could host a NIC from there. I'm thinking of some Dell Optiplex, actually I can get a 3070 for a decent price but without this multi NIC capability i'm not motivated to buy it. It does have a empty "cross" at the back (if no optional port there) but I really don't know how to profit from it. 
 Has some of you used a small factor PC to turn into a multi NIC router ? If yes could you point me some models, tips or anything of help. 
 Thanks a lot !

 I was wondering what solutions you guys are implementing to keep digitised versions of important documents. 
 I think I've outgrown my basic folder structure and wanted something that could replace it. 
 I don't have any significant requirements, though I would prefer that files are stored as files and not in a database, for ease of retrieval in case something goes wrong.

 Like announced in the title, I am not an expert in these matters...
 That being said, I have a big house (3 floors) that will need renovating. I wanted to find a spot where to put the incoming fibre connexion, a 4 bay Synology NAS with media and personal backup, probably a second one for video surveillance, and a switch that would be linked to several ethernet plugs in the house (likely 8+).
 There's a small room below the stairs where this could fit well. But apart from a small door, there is of course no window in there.
 Is that a problem? Any recommendations for what I'd like to achieve?
 Thank you very much!

 DL380 G9 12x LFF, 2x 2667v4, 256GB RAM + iodrives in PCIe Slots
  
Storage:
  
DL380 G9 12x LFF, 2x 2650v4, 192GB RAM (Fully filled with WD Golds)
 MSA 2040 12x LFF filled with some shucked and some wd drives
  
​
 currently i run some minor vm's and the main debian zfs vm on the dl380g9(storage)
 i got esxi installed and im passing through the controllers needed to see my disks in the vm directly
 ​
 Current options:
 A: Selfbuild new Server with an SM or Chenbro case (24/36x LFF) and either barebone debian or passthrough with controller again
 B: used SAN like the 3par 8000 and giving it an vm on the compute cluster
 ​
 Main concern is future upgrades and power as im currently at 0,83€ per kw/h also soonish switching from vmware to xen or proxmox whatever fits me better after testing
 ​
 may the hoarding help!

 I want to see busy times on each of these calendars based on meetings/events on the other calendars. Preferably something selfhosted/opensource
 potentially something that I can connect all calendars to and automatically update it across them. I.e. New calendar event on google calendar 1 means add busy block on all the others.
 I am not looking something like calendly that will create a link to show available times. if it does the above and also provide a link that would be okay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I have Windows 10 and for the longest time I've wanted to know if there's anything I can do differently or better to maintain my drives. I have mixed SATA SSDs, NVMes and HDDs, 12 total.
 I know Windows does TRIM on SSDs, but I don't know...there's something satisfying about running a command or a maintenance cycle that I can see working and see the results of, if you know what I mean.
 Do you run maintenance on your drives regularly? Any recommendations of what I can do to keep them running well? Lastly, do you set Windows to turn off your drives after X amount of minutes in power options, and do you use hibernate? Does hibernate harm SSDs with the writes?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there!
 I'm simply using a Raspberry Pi 4 8GB with an 2TB external HDD for all of my self hosted stuff. I'm pretty happy with it but I'm curious what equipment other people are using and why they have what they have. I've been using my setup for several months now and I love it. I was considering sinking some more money into a more professional setup like a rack of some kind and a little more horsepower for game servers and whatnot.
 What equipment do you have?

Some of the equipment was labeled with Engineering Sample stickers stating that they could not be sold, so I was able to get some presumably research equipment for free... but I have no idea what these are other than yes, they are motherboards.
 I acquired five of these because I think they'd be cool nerd wall art and make cool gifts, but I'd love to know more about them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pretty old Unifi setup, with a gen 1 USG, and a gen 1 cloud key. They are no longer accepting upgrades, and I’m afraid to even try updating them manually. I work from home and the last time I upgraded them, I had to take PTO due to the firmware being faulty and having to restore to a previous version.
 While I really like the Unifi platform, I’m thinking of switching to Omada’s platform. My wireless is Ruckus Unleashed, and my security system is Reolink. I’ll never use the other features of the DreamMachines. 
 However, Omada is still a newer platform. They just released mDNS, which is what I’ve been holding out for. I see they are releasing a 10GB router, which would directly compete with the UDM platform. I’m debating about going into the Omada platform, or built a OPNSense box, and use that. However, at the end day I don’t want to futs with it, I really like my homelab, but the amount of time I dedicated to it is slowly declining, and if the internet goes out not only does it affect my work, but my wife will also not happy with me lol.
 The part I like about OPNSense, is the hardware HA and the ability to load balance two ISP connections which could come in handy 
 Any suggestions?

Yet, most of the open source self-hosted alternatives that I am seeing are either full-blown project management suites or fairly outdated timesheet tools. 
 Is there any simple, elegant, basic time-tracking and invoicing tool out there, like Harvest?

 Which self-hosted Free and open source eCommerce solution would you suggest and why? I am looking for the one with the most free features without having to pay for plugins. Drupal commerce has caught my eye, but please try and convince me otherwise.
 ​
 I know some will say it depends on lots of things, but why would you suggest one over the other in a general sense?
 ​
 I would also appreciate any article links on my choices, but must be a list of FOSS suggestions, please?

 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I used to use Tdarr, but I'm currently trying Unmanic because it seems a bit simpler and easier to configure. However, whilst there are lots of installation write-ups, there isn't any plugin/job/process/test setup tutorials for 'standard' configurations that people might want to use. Anyone got any sources for these?
 I'm basically wanting to set it up to:
  
Use the intel quicksync plugin
 Only process files > 5GB
 Transcode to reduce them down using h264, but at a lower bitrate etc so aiming to get about 1GB/hour
 Only run processing/transcoding between certain hours (e.g., 1am => 5am)
  
I've added the plugin, a worker, and the filesize test (which I think does #2) but just want to see if somebody else has written up their settings so I can make sure I've got it right before I point it at my library. :)
 Running it on a Synology via Docker, although I don't think that's relevant for this question.

 I'll be using the dual port card like that:
 -The WAN port will be connected to the ONT (essentially a fiber to ethernet adapter)
 -The LAN port of the card will be connected to a switch since this pfsense pc will have more VMS in the future. Nothing demanding, I'm just planning on a Raspberry Pi image VM (for 3D printer interface) and maybe more intresting stuff.
